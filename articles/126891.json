The Mandalorian and Dune taught the villagers some basic fighting and shooting techniques, then arranged for them to build defenses around the village so the Klatooinian tribe's AT-ST Raider and tribe were forced to approach from a single entrance. The village then dug holes in front of the entrance so the AT-ST Raider would fall into it after stepping forward. The plan worked and ended with the AT-ST Raider destroyed and the Klatooinian tribe repelled."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
