They then met Babu Frik to force C-3PO to translate it. They then traveled to Kef Bir to find the wayfinder. At the Death Star II wreckage, Kylo Ren dueled her and destroyed the wayfinder. Rey triumphed, but after feeling Leia Skywalker Organa Solo become one with The Force, Rey healed him. In fear, Rey fled to Ahch-To. Luke Skywalker appeared to her as a Force ghost and convinced her to go to Exegol. Once there, Rey confronted the Emperor, and was joined by a redeemed Kylo Ren. At the same time, the Resistance arrived to destroy the fleet of Xyston-class Star Destroyers.
