In 5000 BBY, Parrah was aboard the Omen when it was knocked off course as it jumped to hyperspace during a skirmish with Jedi above the moon Phaegon III, where the Omen was stationed for a mining mission.

Parrah survived the crash, and eventually the Sith came to be worshiped as gods by the planet's Keshiri natives. By 4985 BBY, Ermon Parrah had become the main science advisor for the remaining Sith, led by Captain Yaru Korsin. That year, the Houk gunner Gloyd, still hoping to find a way off Kesh, proposed that the Sith use the Omen's surviving boring lasers to fire signals into space.

However, the uprising was crushed by the Tribe's forces. As punishment, Parrah's supporters were enslaved and became the first Human slaves on Kesh. Meanwhile, Parrah and all his descendants were forced to spin a cord that would reach the stars. Since this task was physically impossible, Parrah and his descendants were condemned to millennia of slavery and became known as the Spinner family. For generations, the Spinner family worked as tailors and weavers in Eorm, a port town that was home to exiled Sith and Keshiri slaves. The Spinner family continued spinning the cord even during the Time of the Rot, which saw a breakdown of law and order in Keshtah Minor, the Tribe's domain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of Ermon Parrah's descendants was the Sith criminal Parlan Spinner, who was the only person in the family line to rebel against this servitude. Following a failed attempt to assassinate the ruling Grand Lord Varner Hilts in 2974 BBY, Spinner awakened the ancient Sith Lord Remulus Dreypa and together the two Sith instigated an uprising against the Tribe. However, he turned against Dreypa after the latter unleashed leviathans, reptilian Sithspawn, that were capable of draining the souls of sentient beings. In the end, Spinner fulfilled his ancestor's ambition to \"ascend\" to the stars when he discovered an ancient Jedi starship beneath the Sith capital Tahv's Circle Eternal plaza.

This led him to lead a failed attempt to steal the Omen from the Sith Temple. However, he was defeated.

His legacy was continued by Parlan Spinner."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to an email exchange with Miller dating back to October 20 2013, Miller confirmed that the relief navigator Parrah and the Sith rebel Ermon Parrah were in fact the same person. He also clarified that Parrah's rebellion had occurred between the events of the two eBooks Paragon and Savior, since the comic Spiral 3 depicted the Kesh Sith Temple, which was sealed off after the events of Savior. Miller has argued that the Lost Tribe of Sith did not kill Parrah because the Tribe was running out of Humans by that time. According to Miller, the script for Spiral 3 had initially conceptualized Parrah fighting an older Yaru Korsin. However, Miller and his team opted not to name Parrah's opponent since he did not resemble the older version of the character in Pablo Hidalgo's The Essential Reader's Companion, which was released on August 21, 2012. Thus, Miller has speculated that Parrah's opponent was actually one of Korsin's allies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
