Its highly complex musculature allowed it to flow across different environments. This same musculature was used to extend its scales to spear prey; additionally, a gluey compound produced by glands just under the scales would further impede movement of its quarry. After spearing its meal, the glim worm uses its muscles to move the captured prey from scale to scale into its mouth, where it was eaten whole. It used subtle vibrations in the ground as a tool for hunting."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
