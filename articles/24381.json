The Pirates had acquired the production facility and restarted it after the SoroSuub Corporation had abandoned the project after producing only a few production models. As part of a deal with Moff Vilim Disra of the Imperial Remnant, the Cavrilhu Pirates supplied the Preybirds to the Remnant in exchange for money and tactical assistance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
