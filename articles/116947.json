He served the clan on the planet Makem Te, as a low-level drug dealer selling the spice tempest. In 19 ABY, the Jedi archivist Mander Zuma killed a number of Bomu Clan Rodians inside a Bomu warehouse on Makem Te and following their deaths, Rolan was left as the only Bomu Clan member on Makem Te. His chain of contact with the Spice Lord, the producer of tempest, was broken, and Rolan soon ran out of supplies of the drug. He was hassled by angry customers who had been driven into a state of rage by their withdrawal from the drug, and he was later captured by Zuma and the spacers Reen Irana and Eddey Be'ray, who forced Rolan to reveal everything that he knew about the tempest trade."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
