When Admiral Rae Sloane left Akiva, Isstra pleaded with her not to leave him to the mercy of an enraged mob. However, Sloane rebuffed his pleas and struck him. After killing two of his guards, she told Isstra that he was of no use to the Empire any longer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Isstra Dirus served as Satrap of the Akivan city of Myrra during the Age of the Empire. He collaborated with the Galactic Empire and helped enforce the Empire's laws and taxes on Akiva. In return, Imperial corporations channeled considerable funds into his coffers. Under his rule, Akiva was reputed as a planet in the Outer Rim Territories where one could hide money and procure illicit goods including slaves.

The Satrap greeted his guests after they landed their shuttles on a raise landing platform above his palace. After his guests arrived, Satrap Dirus provided them with refreshments in the form a buffet dinner.

In response, Sloane ordered the Imperial delegates to evacuate Myrra."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Admiral Sloane shot down a TIE fighter which had been hijacked by Norra.

However, Sloane thanked him for his services and motioned for two of her stormtroopers to drag him back to the doorway. When two of his guards came to his aid, the stormtroopers mowed down the guards.
