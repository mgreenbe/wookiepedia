But the adventurer needed the endorsements of Scathe's trusted inner circle first, including Xaroon's. Xaroon did her own dirty work and didn't really need any help with her current operations. But then she remembered her belongings that had been stolen by Hoverdale and decided to give the spacer a chance. She gave the spacer the coordinates to Hoverdale's Hideout and asked the adventurer to bring back as much of her stolen property as possible. Soon the spacer returned and presented Propti's old pouch that contained some of the things that were stolen from her. Xaroon was very thankful and sent her endorsement to Scathe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Propti Xaroon was a Non-Player Character (NPC) in Sony Online Entertainment's MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
