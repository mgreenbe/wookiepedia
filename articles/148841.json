The Pirates and the Prince combines four of the five episodes of the Mon Julpa arc into one story, while Treasure of the Hidden Planet combines the four episodes of the Mungo Baobab arc into one story. The original opening credits and theme song are not included as part of the films, and were replaced with simple credit sequences and new scores by Marco D'Ambrosio."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Besides cutting the theme song of the series, many other small modifications were made for the home video releases, most notably changes to the soundtrack. The song that R2-D2 plays on the jukebox is now the song that the Max Rebo Band plays in The Pirates and the Prince. A new prologue is narrated by Alex Lindsay (digital effects artist for The Phantom Menace), as the voice of Mungo Baobab. The opening sequence of Treasure of the Hidden Planet features clips from the television special \"The Great Heep,\" although the complete special isn't included. These omissions and the added dialog were intended to make the story into a consistant whole, in order to give it more of a feature-film feeling."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Release"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Treasure of the Hidden Planet was released on Region 1 DVD on November 23, 2004 under the title Star Wars Animated Adventures: Droids.
