In 2 BBY, when Galen Marek, secret apprentice of Darth Vader, visited the planet of Nar Shaddaa to find Jedi Master Rahm Kota, the guardsman was sent with a task force to kill him. The apprentice got past all of his Imperial Navy commandos, and then engaged the guard in duel at the front of The Undertow, a bar that Kota was at, with the latter ambushing him with a Force Push, and first sent a wave of EVO Troopers to take on Marek. After a while, the guardsman summoned his Shadow Troopers to aid him.
