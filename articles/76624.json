In 22 BBY, he was assigned to the Venator-class Star Destroyer Laudable under the command of the Phuii Jedi General Ares Nune. Nune's forces had been dispatched to the Phu system to patrol for any Separatist activity in the area. While Kite was talking to Nune on the bridge of the Laudable, the task force was attacked by the Malevolence, a Confederacy warship equipped with two giant ion pulse cannons on each of its sides. Under the command of Confederacy General Grievous, the Malevolence destroyed the shields of the entire fleet with the ion cannons. After doing so, the ship proceeded to destroy Nune's entire task force, using its turbolasers to obliterate the exposed ships, and eliminating General Nune, Kite, and their forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kite was the nickname of a clone trooper commander in the Grand Army of the Republic. In 22 BBY, during the height of the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Kite was assigned to the Phuii Jedi General Ares Nune. Nune was in charge of a Republic task force, made up of at least three Venator-class Star Destroyers, to patrol the Phu system for any Separatist activity.

The Malevolence was a Subjugator-class heavy cruiser under the command of General Grievous, the Cyborg Supreme Commander of the Separatist's Droid Army. As Kite and Nune were finishing up their conversation, Grievous ordered the Malevolence to fire one of its two ion pulse cannons at the Republic task force, which disabled the shields of the entire fleet. Nune's task force was caught off guard, and General Nune, Kite, and their fleet was destroyed by the Malevolence's turbolaser batteries.

His mindset kept him from relating fully to his Jedi General, and when Ares Nune tried to strike up a conversation, likening their search to an old fable, Kite was uninterested. Kite thought himself better suited to ground operations, and felt uncomfortable being aboard a starship rather than on solid planetary ground. He had brown eyes, black hair, tan skin, and a number of scars covering his face. Like all other clone troopers, Kite stood at 1.83 meters tall."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kite made his first appearance in the six-page The Clone Wars webcomic Shakedown, which led into \"Rising Malevolence\", an episode in the first season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars.
