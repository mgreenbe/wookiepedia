As part of his training, Darth Vader ordered the clone to destroy a trio of Sith training holodroids imitating Juno Eclipse and a pair of Rebel troopers in order to test the clone's willingness to destroy his template's legacy. The clone easily eliminated the droids disguised as Alliance troops, but the imprinted memories and emotions of his progenitor prevented him from striking down the one disguised as Eclipse. Disappointed with the result of the test, Vader destroyed the droid and determined that the clone was another failure, no different than the other clones that couldn't free themselves from Marek's emotions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
