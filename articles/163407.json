A standout starfighter pilot, he was one of the few to survive the Battle of Yavin, after which he founded Rogue Squadron with his friend Luke Skywalker. Antilles and Skywalker built Rogue Squadron into a renowned unit, and after the Battle of Hoth, Antilles took command. He flew as Red Leader in the Battle of Endor, striking the blow that destroyed the second Death Star alongside Lando Calrissian and becoming the only pilot to survive both Death Star runs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Rebel Alliance became the New Republic, Antilles continued to serve, gaining a reputation as a consummate soldier and the New Republic's greatest pilot.

As a general, he reluctantly moved out of the cockpit and into a role in fleet operations, frequently commanding the Star Dreadnought Lusankya. During a mission to the planet Adumar in 13 ABY, he ignited a romance with Iella Wessiri, a friend in whom he had been interested for several years, and married her after the mission's conclusion. They had two daughters, Syal and Myri, as Antilles became Chief of Staff of New Republic Starfighter Command and then finally returned to command Rogue Squadron in 18 ABY.

He joined the forces of his homeworld, Corellia, as it revolted against the galactic government, reluctantly taking a side against his best friend, General Tycho Celchu, and his own daughter Syal, who had become a Galactic Alliance pilot. He served as the Supreme Commander of the Corellian Defense Force, but he came to believe that the Corellian regime was itself corrupt and immoral. He resigned and instead offered his services to the New Jedi Order, led by his lifelong friend Luke Skywalker. Skywalker formed a Jedi Coalition and, with Antilles's help, destroyed the Centerpoint superweapon controlled by the Corellian Confederation, then went on to defeat the Galactic Alliance's Sith leader, Darth Caedus, and end the war.

He had a sister, Syal, who was ten years older. She left Corellia while Antilles was only seven and lived estranged from her family. The Antilleses never had any word of her and spoke very little about her, but Wedge Antilles remained fond of the sister he never really knew. He lived untouched by the Galactic Empire and the dissent rising against it. Simpler concerns occupied his mind, such as his dream of living in Coronet City, the glittering capital of Corellia. He had maps of the city projected onto the walls of his bedroom, and he longed to contribute to those maps himself by becoming an architect and building great structures. At the same time, he was fascinated by space, and daydreamed of naval adventures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Antilles split his time between a farm school located in Corellia's northern hemisphere and his parents' fueling depot on the Gus Treta station. At farm school, he received training in rural tasks along with his education. He learned to ride thaks and slopewings, and from them herded nerfs and naugas. The other half of the year, Antilles traded pastoral pursuits for immersion in the world of spacegoing technology. Even as a child, he flew tugs and shuttles in busy Corellian space. He worked as a mechanic as well and developed a great proficiency in repair as well as piloting."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His family was friendly with Booster Terrik, a noted Corellian smuggler. Terrik's daughter, Mirax Terrik, was about Antilles's age, and she frequently stayed with the Antilles family when her father was on dangerous smuggling missions. She and Antilles were close friends throughout their youth, calling each other by the respective childhood nicknames \"Myra\" and \"Veggies.\" Antilles often put his talents to work assisting the smuggler in the upkeep of his ship, the Pulsar Skate, and sometimes even accompanied the Terriks on smuggling trips. In return, Antilles learned many of Terrik's underworld tricks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Just before his eighteenth birthday, a time when Antilles was in his last days of upper division school, the Bonestar Pirates' ship Buzzzer under Loka Hask docked with the fueling station. Antilles was aboard Booster Terrik's Pulsar Skate just off Gus Treta when the Corellian Security Force arrived. The Buzzzer fled the station without unhooking its fuel lines, starting a fire that threatened to destroy the station. Terrik established communications with Antilles's parents, and Antilles listened in horror as Jagged and Zena decided to sacrifice themselves in order to reach the lancing charge that would separate the fueling module from the station, keeping the rest of Gus Treta from destruction. Antilles could do nothing but watch the destruction of the module and listen to his parents tell him goodbye."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Antilles grieved, Terrik's information sources revealed that the pirates had destroyed the station on purpose to cover their escape. Antilles asked Terrik for Hask's name, the location of the ship, and the use of a Z-95 Headhunter fighter. The two were able to track the Buzzzer to the Jumus system. Though Terrik, aboard the Pulsar Skate, urged Antilles to merely disable them and let the authorities deal with them, Antilles fired on the pirates from the Headhunter, destroying the ship and avenging his parents.

Though he had some surviving relatives, he did not stay with them. With guidance from Terrik, he used the credits to buy a tiny Corellian-made freighter, which he modified heavily and put to use as a legitimate pilot. Electing to live the life of a simple trader, Antilles struggled economically and had a hard time finding work, despite Terrik's aid in finding contacts. He was unwilling to smuggle but unable to compete in a market where only smuggling paid enough to keep his small freighter in business. In his difficulties, he caught the eye of Car'das syndicate lieutenant Talon Karrde, who once approached him with an offer to transport a cargo for him. Having heard no negative gossip about Karrde and therefore believing the man to be too unknown a quantity, Antilles declined."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2 BBY, Antilles was operating from the Corellian moon Gus Talon. There, he enjoyed the hospitality and services of Rallo, an older man and mechanic who ran a garage, and fell in love with Rallo's daughter, Mala Tinero.

He would not get the chance to conclude the conversation, as he returned to find Gus Talon space in lockdown. Rallo's workshop had been raided and he and his workers had killed the Imperial stormtroopers who threatened Tinero. In retaliation, the Empire had leveled the settlement. A pair of Imperial TIE/LN starfighters engaged Antilles as he attempted to land; outraged at the loss of Tinero, he instinctively unleashed his anger against the fighters, shooting them down.

Tinero's statement that he had been \"lucky\" when he got the contract wore on him, as he thought it tragic that he had not been there with Tinero.

With his experience as a freighter pilot and mechanic, he served as a gunrunner and proved an asset to the Alliance. His Alliance contacts hinted his skills could be even more valuable in the cockpit of a combat ship, and when the Alliance Starfighter Corps put out an open call for pilots, Antilles enthusiastically joined the branch where he could strike directly against the Empire, as the Alliance was increasingly doing. His first notable assignment was among the Tierfon Yellow Aces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While on one patrol, Antilles happened across a secret Imperial research facility where prototype TIE models were tested.

The planet's shield proved stronger than expected, and the attack force suffered heavy losses attempting to breach it. After his squadron was torn apart by a concentrated blast of turbolaser fire, Antilles called for a retreat to be ordered. However, Kota commanded Antilles to hold his position and for all ships to keep pressing the attack. Starkiller, a clone of Force-sensitive Rebel leader Galen Marek, whom Kota was mentoring, piloted the Salvation into the planet's shield generator. Antilles piloted his Y-wing to the planet's surface, covering the ground assault on the cloning facility. Starkiller leaped onto Antilles's fighter during the operation, asking the pilot to carry him to the cloning towers where the Sith Lord Darth Vader, Starkiller's former Master, was holding Rebel Captain Juno Eclipse. Heavy fire kept Antilles from reaching it through the dogfight, so at Starkiller's urging he dove underneath the platform on which the facility was built, then shot his way through the platform near the spires. He emerged near the target and Starkiller jumped into the building. There, Starkiller rescued Eclipse and managed to capture Vader, though Vader did not remain in Rebel custody long."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Antilles served with Red Squadron aboard Mon Calamari Admiral Gial Ackbar's cruiser the Independence in 1 BBY.

He quickly began flying in raids on Imperial convoys. Though considered a show-off, Antilles was a standout pilot and emergent leader in the squadron, and so was quickly put in a position of responsibility. He trained some junior pilots such as Bren Quersey, was responsible for assigning starfighters to the unit's pilots, and was given command of some missions on which Dreis was not present."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 BBY, Red Squadron, stationed at the secret Rebel base in the Great Temple on Yavin 4, a moon of the planet Yavin Prime, was joined by a squad of defectors from the Imperial ship Rand Ecliptic, led by Biggs Darklighter and Derek \"Hobbie\" Klivian. Antilles's first mission with Darklighter was a convoy raid in which Darklighter acquitted himself extremely well.

They played for some time, listening with great interest to news reports of the dissolution of the Imperial Senate, until one of Antilles's cards, during sabacc's usual flux, altered to display a message to meet the smuggler at Hangar Bay 31. Outside the cantina, they encountered a group of thugs who attempted to shake them down for a protection fee on their rented landspeeder.

Antilles ordered Darklighter to engage the enemy fighters with him while Eirriss and Porkins covered Dantels's starship, the Starduster. Antilles destroyed three fighters in the battle, and when Eirriss suffered damage to her fighter's hyperdrive, he ordered her to transfer to the Starduster. Eirriss insisted it would take too much time for her to transfer and the Rebels would be stopped. As Eirriss headed to engage another incoming wave of TIEs, Antilles reluctantly accepted the situation, and Eirriss instead plunged her damaged fighter into the formation of TIEs, taking most of the opposition with her."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Victory at Yavin"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after the pilots returned to Yavin, the Empire's planet-destroying Death Star superweapon advanced on Yavin 4.

Skywalker took the place of Jal Te Gniev as Red Five, as Gniev was down with the measles. Organa, a Rebel leader from the world of Alderaan which had just been destroyed by the Death Star's superlaser, had obtained the Death Star plans, and from them Dodonna found a critical weakness. He told the assembled fliers that a proton torpedo fired down a thermal exhaust port that lacked particle shielding would cause a chain reaction that would destroy the enormous battle station. Antilles voiced his skepticism that the two-meter target could be reliably struck while flying at full speed, under fire, down a trench in the station's surface, only to be reassured by Skywalker that the newcomer had hit targets of that size many times while bush piloting on his homeworld of Tatooine.

Hotly pursued by Vader, he ordered the young pilots to make their own run on the exhaust port and was quickly killed by the Dark Lord of the Sith. Antilles and Darklighter hung back to cover the crack shot Skywalker as Vader and his wingmen again dropped on the trench runners from behind. Antilles took DS-61-3's fire, which destroyed his micro-maneuvering controls. As Antilles's fighter was damaged to the point where he could no longer safely remain near the other fighters in the trench, Skywalker ordered him out.

Antilles emerged with a reputation as a hot young pilot, however, and received medals himself as well. Antilles soon became fast friends with the budding Jedi Skywalker and Solo, a fellow Corellian smuggler.

The pair co-founded Rogue Group, also known as Rogue Squadron or Rogue Flight, as a subunit of Narra's squadron, with Skywalker serving as Rogue Leader. Primarily an X-wing squadron, they were known for an ability and willingness to use a variety of fighters as suited their mission profiles. Both Rogue and Renegade Flights eventually developed into full-strength squadrons, with Narra remaining the commander of both forces. The unit served as a highly independent elite squadron, having no permanent assignment so that it could be dispatched to whichever hotspot in which it was most needed. Antilles made fast friends with his fellow pilots, especially Janson, with whom he shared interests in drinking and gambling, and whose skills as a pilot and gunner provoked Antilles's admiration.

Antilles found the older man drunk and belligerent in the halls of the Great Temple, and attempted to counsel him, only to be cut short by an alarm. Antilles and Te Gniev rushed to the hangar, where Skywalker's protocol droid C-3PO explained that he had accidentally triggered the alarm. Te Gniev, still intoxicated, insensibly attempted to launch anyway. Antilles, shouting at him to stop, had to scramble out of the way as the bitter veteran clipped the side of the exit and plowed the expensive fighter into a tree outside. Te Gniev faced a military council, led by General Dodonna, that moved to transfer him to a recruiting position on Dubrava, a backwater planet. Te Gniev, who denounced the council directly, emerged angry at his treatment, feeling he had been cast aside in favor of the \"golden boy.\" Antilles, waiting outside for word, explained that Skywalker had personally asked the council for leniency.

There, Sarkli saved them from a pair of All Terrain Scout Transports, allowing the Rebels to make their escape. After the evacuation, the Rogues were assigned to pick up Tycho Celchu, an Imperial defector, on the planet Dantooine. Skywalker and Sarkli rescued him from storm commandos who had captured him just as he attempted to defect. On his next mission with Skywalker, Sarkli defected to the Empire.

When the Imperials began orbital bombardment, however, he instead ordered the entire group to attack the Imperial ships at point-blank range, where they would be protected by the capital ships' own shields and by being inside the effective range of their main weapons. The Imperials responded by sending out two full squadrons of TIE interceptors. Corellian Tess Alder, part of flight three, ignored an order from Organa to bug out and instead came toward the group, firing several proton torpedoes at the approaching cluster of enemy fighters. Antilles, knowing how the TIE pilots would evade Alder's torpedoes, formulated a plan to box them in by having Organa assist him in launching their own torpedoes to either side of the TIEs; together, the two Corellians' plans eliminated eleven interceptors.

She promoted Antilles from lieutenant to commander and Skywalker to a full lieutenant, and gave both of them security clearances sufficient to allow them to know everything that was going on. Antilles officially restored Skywalker and Prithi to active duty, and also requested and was granted permission from Mothma to move the squadron to the main hangars, giving them access to full support staff, since their cover had been blown by the manner in which they had returned. After Organa was out of the bacta tank, she briefed Skywalker on the problem with the spy, and Skywalker concocted a plan to find the mole from the other end by infiltrating the Devastator, the Star Destroyer of Imperial Colonel Bircher, who was leading the forces the spy was believed to be reporting to.

After reassembling the Jedi weapon, Skywalker used it to cut their way out of the cell and take out a lone stormtrooper guarding the detention area. Antilles then used the stormtrooper's blaster to destroy the locks in the cell bay, freeing several other prisoners to provide a distraction while the two Rebels headed for the data core facility to insert a worm into the system.

Quickly transferring to X-wings, Antilles and Skywalker were asked by Organa to take the lead in the dogfight; Antilles quickly briefed the squadron on what they were facing before they entered the fight.

The entire Stealth Squadron mission had been a scam to retrieve Kell Bircher, Mothma's nephew. Antilles, along with Skywalker, were present in Mothma's chamber a short time later, seeking answers. Mothma explained that she and her nephew had come up with the plan in infiltrate the Imperials before the Battle of Yavin, and that no one other than them and a Bothan slicer who had set up his fake history. Antilles wanted to know if Bircher had had any safeguards in place when those under his command had been attacking the Rebels; the spy answered that he had, the entire time, kept his thumb on the same override switch that he had used to end the battle, a response that Antilles was content with.

The Imperial base's commanding officer, General Evir Derricote, had used the abandoned Alderaan Biotics facility on the planet in a private black-market operation, and from it the extra interceptor squadrons were based and the power was routed. Antilles worked with Horn, Salm, Page, and Whistler over the next week to devise a plan for a second strike at Borleias. They were able to find a weak point in the power transmission system, a conduit through a rift valley where the line was exposed to attack. Antilles and Salm proposed a plan to Ackbar in which the Rogues would strike at the conduit, Page's commandos would slip in through the exposed tunnel to capture the bases, and the Emancipator would be used in a plot to draw away the Star Destroyer Eviscerator, which they had learned was in position to move on Borleias and disrupt the attack.

The Rogues entered the Pyria system, using Borleias's moon and a meteor shower for cover as they approached the planet. Antilles and Horn began their run through the rift valley while the other X-wings covered them from Borleias's TIEs. They were pursued by two TIEs; Antilles shot one down, while Horn destroyed the other by jettisoning his faulty, punctured auxiliary fuel pod, which put Horn dangerously low on fuel.

They did, however, agree to help Ven point out additional political prisoners whom the Rogues should attempt to free in exchange for taking the dangerous Black Sun kingpins offplanet. The first prisoner freed was Zekka Thyne, a half-Human Corellian crime lord Horn had himself captured. Horn despised Thyne, and Antilles had no great desire to set him free, but agreed to the deal. Kassar Forge, however, informed Antilles that his daughter, Inyri Forge, was Thyne's girlfriend, released with him. Antilles offered to separate her from the criminal, but Kassar, as much as it pained him, refused to prevent Inyri from making her own choices in life.

Horn had insisted that he had vital news Antilles needed to hear; he explained that he had seen Tycho Celchu meeting with Imperial Intelligence agent Kirtan Loor, Horn's personal nemesis from his Corellian Security days, in the Headquarters bar. Antilles told Horn that Celchu had been killed in the Noquivzor attack, putting his fears aside. When Antilles asked Celchu about it, the captain reported that it had been a Duros smuggler, Lai Nootka, with whom he had met, and Antilles believed him. The commander moved to briefing the entire squadron, short of the missing Aril Nunb, assembled along with support from the Black Sun faction and the anti-Imperial Alien Combine, about the new assignment to prepare to take Coruscant. They brainstormed ideas to bring the shields down, focusing on access to the planet's main computer, from which the shielding system was controlled.

When Portha dropped and damaged the one sliced core that technician had selected, Antilles used an old smuggler's trick to force the choice of a replacement core that was likewise sliced. The deception came to naught, however, when the Imperials launched an ambush. Antilles had set up defenses in the warehouse, but they were insufficient to defend against the large body of stormtroopers; their lookouts, controlled by Thyne, had sold them out. In desperation, the commander called in Celchu and fled with his team through Coruscant's cityscape, under constant Imperial pursuit.

Darklighter proposed that they stir up a large storm, easily done in Coruscant's agitated, complex atmosphere, to weaken the shields and knock out power stations. Asyr Sei'lar, a Bothan agent and leader in the Alien Combine, suggested redirecting one of the Orbital Solar Energy Transfer Satellites to vaporize a water reservoir. Horn further refined the plan by advocating they hijack a nearby construction droid and point it at Subsidiary Computer Center Number Four, causing its evacuation and allowing them access to the controls for the orbital mirrors without interference. Antilles approved the plan.

The others had begun repainting their X-wings individually, and Antilles elected to decorate his with the black and checkered green and gold colors his father had hoped to use if he expanded his operations to a chain of refueling depots. Celchu gave him a tour of the Yag-prime station, which still housed a civilian population of traders they could not evict without drawing attention.

Antilles saw merit in the idea and agreed. Terrik quickly began turning a profit from trade on the station, using the credits to secure supplies for the burgeoning resistance. They were joined by Tal'dira's squadron of Twi'lek warriors in their Chir'daki Ugly fighters after Tal'dira suggested that he would like to enter the fight during a trading visit from Koh'shak. Knowing the warrior's pride prevented him from asking directly, Antilles invited him to fight alongside the Rogues, which Tal'dira eagerly accepted. They gained one more pilot when Horn and Mirax Terrik returned from Thyferra with Bror Jace, who had faked his death in order to work underground organizing a Zaltin Corporation alliance with the Ashern.

When the Rogues and Twi'leks arrived, the freighter captains refused to surrender, having been told that Isard would kill their families on Thyferra if their ships were taken. Antilles explained that it was likely a bluff on Isard's part, and offered the help of the resistance fighters on Thyferra in extracting their families. Only one ship, the Xucphra Alazhi, remained defiant.

To counter Isard's message of intimidation, Antilles decided to destroy one of Thyferra's bacta-production colonies.

He moved to complete the refitting of the station and freighters for the final conflict, and set up Karrde's final delivery directly to the base, giving its location away to Isard through her spy in Karrde's organization. Horn, not privy to the plan, questioned it and had to accept Antilles's assurances that there was in fact a working plan.

It had been planned that a faulty transmitter on the moon would provide static that would foul the Implacable's sensors, but if the larger ship destroyed the transmitter, they might be trapped. Antilles proposed a maneuver in which the Night Caller would stand on its stern but tether itself to the surface by a tractor beam, covering itself in a cloud of dust and moving within it by careful manipulation of the tractor beam.

The fight was quickly broken up by New Republic Military Police, but as they were led outside, Loran determined that the police were impostors. The pilots struck out, defeating their would-be captors. Investigation suggested that the impostors were agents of Zsinj, and it was likely that the warlord had identified Wraith Squadron as the unit that had caused him so much trouble and decided to retaliate. Antilles canceled leave, and was soon joined by new pilots to replace the Wraiths' losses: slicer Castin Donn, vehicle specialist Dia Passik, and unarmed combat trainer and intelligence expert Shalla Nelprin. Antilles reorganized the squadron to deal with the additions, assigning Donn as his wingman, moving Janson and Passik into his flight, giving Donos command of Three Flight, and shifting authority over Two Flight from Tainer to Loran. Though Tainer had overcome his difficulty dealing with responsibility in the Battle of Ession, Loran was emerging as a talented and creative officer, and the commander preferred to advance him into a leadership role. Antilles had to deal with some small issues of settling in the new pilots, such as Donn's request that he be transferred from his room assignment with Ekwesh.

Meanwhile, Loran and Phanan presented Antilles with their desire to expose a corrupt training officer who had once preyed upon a friend of theirs by artificially inflating her scores in remedial training and attempting to use it as leverage to get her to participate in a scheme to steal training X-wings. They wished to bait the officer into doing the same with a contact of theirs, but she refused to jeopardize her career by achieving poor scores and turning informant unless she had a guaranteed position waiting for her. The two pilots asked if Antilles would consider allowing their contact, Lara Notsil, to fly for him after the sting.

The rest of the squadron, with the exception of saBinring, broke it up and arrested all of them, posing as military police. Lacking an official transport, they waited on the road outside the base for a military police skimmer to arrive, having had Donn pay off individuals in multiple bars to start trouble that would bring in the genuine authorities. When one did pass by, they hitched a ride to enter the base, saying that their own skimmer had broken down. Once within, Antilles led most of them to the base hangar, where they stole five TIE Interceptors and left graffiti identifying the theft as the work of the Hawk-bats. They were interrupted by the arrival of a new shift of guards to replace the ones they had stunned, but were able to drive them off and launch the TIEs.

Antilles was glad to reunite with the Rogues and his friend Solo aboard the flagship Mon Remonda. While there, he learned that Notsil had executed her exposure of Colonel Atton Repness, the corrupt training officer, without Wraith assistance. She had also taken an accelerated training course afterward, proving herself an exceptional pilot. Though both Rogue and Wraith Squadrons were at full personnel complement, Wraith was badly undersupplied with X-wings, and she would bring a fighter with her, so he accepted her transfer to that unit. On hearing about Notsil's accomplishment, Sarkin approached the commander and confessed that Repness had approached her in the past; though she did not know it, she was the reason Loran, Phanan, and Tainer had masterminded the sting operation. She had not stolen a fighter for him, but she had allowed him to blackmail her into silence due to the fact that her unaltered scores were failing\u2014it was her sensitivity to the issue of altered scores that had provoked the earlier fight with Thri'ag. She informed the commander that Repness's data could destroy her career, but Antilles quickly decided that he was unwilling to lose her and, if the investigation reached her, he would state that she had originally approached him as soon as she joined the squadron and he, not knowing who else might be involved in Repness's operation, had masterminded the training colonel's exposure.

In addition, the sites the Solo Fleet was striking did not seem to be owned by Zsinj; they had been set up to allow Solo to do the warlord's work for him. Klivian, with the Rogues, came up with a plan to avoid doing the same with a lead on the planet Lavisar without tipping off that they were on to Zsinj: a commando strike would plant a bomb to disable the planet's sensor network, but the bomb would deliberately fail, allowing Lavisar authorities to detect the strike force's approach and drive off Wraith Squadron.

One team took over the fueling tanker Bastion, capturing its two escort TIE fighters, and proceeded with the plan to ram the tanker into the base near Hullis. The main force, with Antilles among it but Loran directing operations in case their communications were intercepted, struck at the base near the city of Fellon. It proved to be a trap, with three squadrons lifting and unexpected shields protecting the base. In addition, Iron Fist showed itself in orbit. In fierce fighting, the Hawk-bats quickly cleared eleven enemy TIEs, and the group aboard the Bastion instead used the ship to damage the Star Dreadnought.

The slicer, however, suggested that he infiltrate the ship from within the Narra's smuggling compartment and use the opportunity to upload a program that would track Iron Fist's movements. Feeling any such attempt under the tight scrutiny of their first contact with Zsinj would be too likely to go amiss, Antilles asked him to work up the program but wait for another opportunity to implement it. Loran returned in time to lead the contact team as Kargin, and had been with Phanan as he succumbed to his injuries on Halmad. The veteran commander attempted to counsel Loran on the pain of losing a friend, a constant presence for Antilles. While Loran, Tainer, and Passik traveled to Iron Fist to meet with Zsinj, Donos and Notsil traveled to the planet Aldivy, where her brother had resurfaced and contacted her for a reunion in what turned out to be a Zsinj ploy.

He put that aside as he and Janson analyzed the data Zsinj had provided to prepare for the raid, hoping to deduce his target. Based on the heavy protection, they thought it might be Coruscant, until they realized that the New Republic units Zsinj had provided were actually approximations of Imperial defenses, designed to allow for accurate strength in simulations while throwing off predictions. It was the planet Kuat he would strike, and as Loran had earlier predicted, he was attempting to steal a Star Dreadnought. With morale down, Antilles acceded to Ekwesh's urging that he order all base personnel to show up in dress uniform or formal dress at the mess, where they found the Thakwaash pilot had prepared a formal dance, which cheered the pilots significantly.

The Kettch prank was continued when the voice-altering program Donn had installed in the pirate TIEs changed Antilles's voice to that of an Ewok. Zsinj had detected that variation during combat and Loran explained their Ewok pilot to him as Lieutenant Kettch, an Ewok enhanced by the same techniques as saBinring and endowed with prosthetic appendages to give him the reach to operate a starfighter.

After eliminating them with the aid of Vibroaxe Squadron and Zsinj's 181st Fighter Group, Antilles was contacted by Fel, who expressed a desire to fly with Kettch. As Kettch, Antilles surreptitiously asked about his sister; Fel confirmed that his wife was alive but not aboard Iron Fist.

Antilles confided in him that there was an Ewok within, brought in to play the role of Lieutenant Kettch, and drafted Janson into a supposed secret team entrusted with the knowledge of \"Chulku\" the Ewok and responsible for feeding him. When Janson was first called into feed the Ewok, Antilles pretended Chulku had escaped and had Janson chase after the unseen Ewok with him, making sure they crashed into a closet of cleaning supplies. Claiming Chulku would smell them and never be lured back, he had Janson strip naked and smear Ewok food on himself to mask the scent, then proceed through one door as he tried a different route. Antilles had set up most of the Wraiths within the next room, standing as if frozen, and locked Janson in with the bizarre tableau.

The first attack run against them was made by Fel and Petothel and their respective wingmen. Squeaky opined that Petothel was not a threat, having detected that her lasers were on low power and transmitting a coded message. They continued to dogfight, detaching the explosive charge and setting Konnair loose.

Loran, Nelprin, and Donos all agreed that she was telling the truth, and so Solo agreed to go forward with an attempt to lure Zsinj into a trap at Vahaba. To hold Zsinj in place, as the warlord was refusing to enter gravity wells where he could not quickly escape to hyperspace, he had Loran contact Rogriss and arrange for the loan of an interdictor. Meanwhile, Mon Remonda's medics submitted their report on Donos's fitness for duty, which suggested he was at best on the edge of breakdown.

The next night was another statement by the perator, at which Antilles confronted Darpen and revealed that he fully understood that the intelligence agent had manipulated the perator into the declaration of war, desperate to pull Adumar into the New Republic camp, and that his career depended on success here and his bloody plan not becoming public knowledge. The perator, meanwhile, declared war against the nations holding out against his declaration and asked the Imperial and New Republic delegations to lead Cartann forces in the war so he could better measure their skill.

It was well he was not, as he arrived at her apartment only to find that her husband, Diric Wessiri, had been found after being thought dead. The Rogue was taken aback and put aside romantic thoughts, taking joy in his friend's happiness. He saw in Diric a man profoundly different from himself and believed that he could not have given Iella the stability she wanted in any case, resigning himself to pure friendship with her.

He never quite managed to begin dating her, as various crises intervened, and Antilles awkwardly avoided bringing up the subject of romance. He did not want to pressure her into a relationship, and so avoided making any overt moves. In 11 ABY, once he had taken an assignment on Coruscant's surface doing reconstruction work, Antilles decided to ask her out at Corran Horn's urging.

When he traveled to her apartment to ask her for a favor, he insisted on an answer as to how he had lost her friendship. She explained that she had been attracted to Antilles, but never made a move. When she saw him with Xux, she felt that she had thrown away her chance to be with him and could not stand the pain of facing that loss when she saw him, and so had drifted away\u2014and now asked him to leave. About to give up, Antilles realized, and told Wessiri, that he would be throwing out their chance of happiness because of past mistakes that could in fact be fixed.

They spent a great deal of time together, growing close. He gave her jewelry and took her to Ithor while squiring her about, hoping the romantic location would allow them to deepen their relationship. It did, and the pair shared their first kiss after a picnic on Ithor's surface.

Higgins, used to television acting practices, had not memorized his lines, of which the Antilles character originally had several, closely and grew increasingly nervous and dispirited as he struggled during shooting. After one day of shooting, he was fired. Lawson, who had originally been passed for the role in favor of Higgins, was brought in.

In it, he was assigned a backstory similar to that of Biggs Darklighter, establishing him as Luke Skywalker's oldest, best friend, from Tatooine. He was also given an old girlfriend, Belina, from Tatooine. The issue told the story of Antilles and Wes Janson, who was identified as Antilles's former roommate at a military academy, surviving as maroons on Hoth after the battle depicted in The Empire Strikes Back. Janson died, while Antilles survived to be rescued, overcoming a gang of scavengers. All further material on Antilles, however, ignored this issue, establishing a unique background for the character and showing him successfully evacuating Hoth with the other Rebels, while Janson continued to show up in material set well after the events of the comic. With the comic's status as S-canon, or not canon until referenced, this effectively invalidated the issue. Twenty years after the issue's publication, the Planet Hoppers article Hoth: Under the Ice undertook the task of integrating elements from the issue back into canon.

Stackpole, tied in to the X-Wing novel series Stackpole began in 1996, which also featured Antilles as one of the main characters, leading Rogue Squadron slightly later on in the timeline. Stackpole was brought in to write the comics due to the fact that, when Dark Horse Comics expressed interest in an X-wing series in 1994, he was already contracted to write the X-wing novels. Editor Sue Rostoni suggested that Stackpole use Antilles in his novels due to his popularity, but both were shocked to find out just how popular Antilles was, as sales for the books proved surprisingly high. Stackpole has maintained that he would have used Antilles even without Rostoni's suggestion, as he found Antilles, with his film background, accomplishments, and connection to the main characters of the Star Wars saga, to be the ideal main character for the series.

Stackpole would write one more X-Wing novel and Allston two, and both also wrote several more novels outside the series, almost every one of which has included Antilles, with the exceptions of Allston's Fate of the Jedi: Backlash, in which Antilles was only mentioned, and Fate of the Jedi: Conviction, which did not feature Antilles at all. Allston's novel Legacy of the Force: Fury in particular was a notable usage, as in it Antilles became the first and thus far only character ever to kill a Rogue Leader in starfighter combat when he shot down active Rogue Leader Lensi. Stackpole intended to include Antilles, as well as background material on the character, in the proposed comic Specter of Thrawn, but the project was not picked up.
