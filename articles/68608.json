He flew under the call sign of \"Storm\" in Captain Gunn Yage's Skull Squadron, a Predator-class fighter unit. In 137 ABY, Skull Squadron was stationed on the galactic capital of Coruscant when bounty hunter and former Jedi Cade Skywalker attempted to rescue the Bothan Jedi Knight Hosk Trey'lis from the Temple of the Sith. Given orders to capture Skywalker alive, Akura and the Skulls engaged the former Jedi's starship, the Mynock, in the skies of the planet until Skywalker managed to lose his pursuers in Coruscant's undercity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Approximately a week later, Akura flew against the Mynock once again when a group of Skywalker's allies, including his mother, Moff Nyna Calixte\u2014acting in disguise so she would not be recognized\u2014piloted the ship as they attempted to rescue Skywalker from the Sith Temple, where he was being held captive. Just as the Skulls started to wear down the Mynock, they were given orders to abort the mission by Captain Yage's father, Moff Rulf Yage. Akura was disappointed by the orders, since he would have liked to capture a Skywalker. After the apparent death of Emperor Darth Krayt, Akura and the Skulls were stationed aboard the Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer War Hammer as part of a mission to capture Emperor-in-exile Roan Fel while he attempted to meet with members of the Jedi Order on the planet Agamar to discuss a possible alliance against the Sith. The operation failed, however, and Fel was able to escape the ambush. Following the Sith Empire's poisoning of the Mon Calamari homeworld Dac as part of Lord Krayt's command to eradicate the Mon Calamari species for aiding the Galactic Alliance Remnant, Akura and the Skulls were part of a mission to poison the planet Da Soocha as punishment for harboring Mon Calamari refugees. During the operation, Skull Squadron was deployed to intercept all craft trying to escape the moon, and under Rauder's orders, they destroyed unarmed civilian vessels."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the return of Darth Krayt, Akura and the Skulls participated in the Sith Empire's attack on the Hidden Temple of the Jedi Order.

Under strict orders to capture Skywalker alive, Akura and the Skulls pursued Skywalker's starship, the Helot-class transport Mynock, through the skies of Coruscant. Skywalker was able to outmaneuver the Skulls, and they lost sight of the starship in the Coruscant undercity. Yage ordered the squadron to spread out and search the area for the Mynock, displeased with the Skulls' performance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Failing to find the Mynock, Akura returned to his squadron's hangar within the new Imperial Palace along with the pilots. While Yage berated the Skulls for their performance, the Captain's father, Moff Rulf Yage, approached the group and stated that the loss of the Mynock was unacceptable. Defending her pilots, Captain Yage pointed out that the ship's identification hadn't been confirmed, and it was an unavoidable outcome due to the Moff's order to bring in Skywalker alive. This prompted the Moff Yage to scold his daughter for making excuses before he dismissed the squadron. Akura was astonished that the Captain had been able to survive her childhood, but she stood up for her father, noting that he had wanted a boy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Approximately a week later, Akura and Skull Squadron were given another chance to capture the Mynock, which this time was piloted by some of Skywalker's allies, who were planning to rescue the former Jedi from the Sith Temple, where he was being held captive.

Skull Squadron was flying in the area in response to the explosions when Akura spotted the Mynock. The squadron soon engaged the transport, inflicting damage upon the vessel. However, just as the Skulls had the Mynock locked in their sights, an order came in from Moff Yage commanding Skull Squadron to abort their mission. The order had been arranged by Calixte to allow her to rescue her son instead. The Skulls were displeased with the directives, and Akura commented that he would have liked to have captured a Skywalker; however, the squadron obeyed the Moff's command and disengaged the Mynock."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Operation: Thunderstroke"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later that year, following the apparent death of Darth Krayt at the hands of his personal advisor, Darth Wyyrlok, Akura and the Skulls were stationed aboard the Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer War Hammer as part of Operation: Thunderstroke, a mission ordered by the newly appointed Regent of the Empire, Grand Admiral Morlish Veed. The mission's goal was to capture Emperor-in-exile Roan Fel while he attempted to meet with members of the Jedi Order to discuss a possible alliance against the Sith.

The squadron's Sith commander, Darth Rauder, ordered the Skulls to destroy some vessels trying to leave moon. Skull Three, Tev Rimon, reported the vessels were civilian non-combatants, and Akura confirmed that the ships were unarmed. However, Rauder was unrelenting, and the Skulls destroyed the civilian vessels. After the bombardment was completed and stormtroopers had ensured there were no survivors on the planet, the Sith ordered the recall of their forces, considering the mission a great victory."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Attack on the Hidden Temple"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Darth Krayt returned to take control of the Sith Empire, Akura and the Skulls participated in the Empire's attack on the Hidden Temple of the Jedi Order on the planet Taivas.

Rauder ordered Skull Squadron to destroy a ship full of Jedi younglings, and unable to kill defenseless children, Captain Yage fired on Darth Rauder instead, killing the Sith Lord. Not willing to continue to serve under the Sith, Yage announced she was defecting to serve Emperor Roan Fel, and the other Skulls followed her.

One of Akura's colleagues, Tev \"Crasher\" Rimon, once made a comment that criminals changed their ships' ID codes more than Akura changed girlfriends.

Akura was disappointed when Skull Squadron was ordered to abort their mission to capture the Mynock, stating that he would have liked to have captured a Skywalker.
