At one point, Barpotomous Drebble acquired it. However, it was stolen from him and wound up in the collection of Dryden Vos, the public face of the crime syndicate Crimson Dawn. The idol was smashed to bits during a confrontation between Vos, Qi'ra and Han Solo. Years later, however, a similar artifact was in the possession of Darth Vader, who kept it in his castle on Mustafar. Around 34 ABY, the dancing goddess was kept by the Ithorian collector Dok-Ondar in his shop in Black Spire Outpost on Batuu."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
