Upon the spacers return with the crystal, Pwwoz took and smashed it on the ground, taunted the spirit, and attempted to kill the confused spacer. When the spacer subdued Pwwoz, who later recovered and apologized for his actions, they took a shard of the crystal for themselves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pwwoz Pwwa was a non-playable character in the massively-multiplayer online roleplaying game Star Wars Galaxies prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
