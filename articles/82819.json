He was tall for an Ewok, with tan-striped skin. Logray wore a headdress made of a large churi bird skull. He carried a team decorated with the bones of the spine of a defeated enemy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In his youth, Logray was a great warrior. He was enslaved by Morag the Tulgah witch but learned her Force \"magic\" secrets and escaped. Strong in the Force, he became a shaman. Later, as a wise elder, he helped Chief Chirpa administer the village. His \"magic\" and his advice were invaluable to the tribe on many occasions, especially when the Duloks or Morag the Tulgah witch threatened the village. When Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka was kidnapped by the Fleebogs, Logray shrunk Wicket W. Warrick and Teebo so that they might rescue Kneesaa, and provided them with his \"magical\" growing powder to return them all to normal size. In addition to invoking various Ewok deities, Logray wielded the \"magic\" of the Sunstar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1 ABY during the Festival of Love, he traveled to Theed on Naboo with Chief Chirpa, on the invitation of Queen Kylantha. As he had no knowledge of the Galactic Civil War, he was welcoming to both Rebels and Imperials alike."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Logray's first apprentice was Zarrak, but he was banished from the village because he started practicing dark \"magic\" and tried to steal the Sunstar. Wicket W. Warrick later tried to become Logray's apprentice, but his \"magical\" talents were limited. His friend Teebo eventually became Logray's star apprentice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, when Cindel and Mace Towani needed the help of the Ewoks when a Gorax kidnapped their parents, Logray helped organize and equip a rescue expedition. Though he did not go himself, he provided Mace with a \"magical\" stone which acted as a key to the Gorax's cave. Logray also provided several other items critical to the success of their quest, including a candle capable of housing Wisties, given to Cindel, and an enchanted walking stick, given to Wicket."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Logray took a turn towards darkness as he aged. The youth of the tribe began to see the live sacrifices practiced by the elders of the tribe as backwards and barbaric. When Wicket spoke out against Logray's increased use of the \"Dark Rituals,\" Logray banished Wicket from participation in all of the rituals. It was Logray who ordered the sacrifice of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, and R2-D2 to honor \"the Golden One\" (C-3PO). However, it was Logray who, after learning of their cause,  anointed the group as members of the tribe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Endor, Logray was exposed as a coward and a bully. Chirpa ousted Logray, appointing Paploo in his place. Furious, Logray retaliated by placing a curse on the village, Paploo enlisted the aid of \"the Golden One\" in a ritual to remove the curse. Logray went into exile, and the Ewoks refused to speak his name ever again. He was even stricken from the village \"songs of remembrance\" as though he never existed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Logray was portrayed Mike Edmonds in Return of the Jedi and by Bobby Bell in Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure. In Ewoks, Logray was voiced by Doug Chamberlain during it's first season and by Rick Cimino during the second."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Logray's appearance changes quite radically between Return of the Jedi, Caravan of Courage, and the Ewoks cartoon, with the primary unifying factor between them all being the churi bird skull on his headdress."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "LEGO sold a minifigure of the ewok along with Tokkat.
