It was managed by an old Devaronian Labio, and was clerked by the Human Mioe and the Wookiee Wurrooba. Starwind Chandlery supplied the majority of spacer's equipment, ranging from spacesuits to a small variety of weapons such as blaster pistols. The store's main source of business was supplying starships with consumables such as air and water. A ship the size of an EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate could take the entire stock of the store's ship consumables and it would last the crew of the frigate a couple of weeks. Starwind Chandlery could, however, arrange larger orders of consumables at a month's notice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Starwind Chandlery first appeared in Preparing for War, an adventure scenario from 1998's The Far Orbit Project, by Timothy S. O'Brien. The book was a supplement to West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game and was a sequel of sorts to the previous publication, Pirates & Privateers, carrying on that book's theme by following the privateering EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate Far Orbit. The scenario provided it as an example of the stores in the market that the crew of the Far Orbit could visit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
