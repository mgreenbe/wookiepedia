After declaring her own kingdom on Begeren, Tytonus was exiled from the Sith Empire, but maintained power through an extensive mercenary army. The Sith queen's revolution came to an end around 3643 BBY when she entered into an alliance with another rebelling Sith Lord\u2014Grathan. Tytonus sought to aid Grathan on Dromund Kaas by landing her army on the planet and marching on the Imperial capital of Kaas City. During the attempt, Lord Tytonus was killed by an Imperial strike team."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
