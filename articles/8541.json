Her relationship with Supreme Commander Gilad Pellaeon appears to have been quite personal; through interactions with him she consistently referred to, and at times addressed him by his personal name, \"Gilad\", a highly unorthodox form of communication between a Navy Captain and a Grand Admiral."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Indeed, Admiral Pellaeon appeared to hold considerable trust in Yage, as he advised the Jedi aboard the Jade Shadow who appeared towards the end of the Battle of Bastion to seek out Captain Yage at Yaga Minor. Yage held discussions with Jedi Knight Jacen Solo, while reluctantly awaiting orders from the Council of Moffs, who hoped to fill the power vacuum that appeared to form with the supposed death of Pellaeon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After learning that Pellaeon had indeed survived, Yage was contacted by General Berrida, who like the Council was unaware of the Grand Admiral's survival. As a show of faith, Solo aided Yage by answering the communication from Berrida instead of Captain Yage, so as to stall the Council's attempts to bring her under their command. With Pellaeon in a critical condition, he was vulnerable and keeping his survival secret became a priority for Yage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Pellaeon recovered in a bacta tank, Yage became somewhat of an ally to the Jedi. Pellaeon soon revealed his survival to the Moffs who in fear of his wrath at their intrigue hastened to comply with his commands to flee for Borosk and ready for battle with the Yuuzhan Vong. During the battle Yage acted as Pellaeon's personal assistant and following the Imperial victory, he ordered her to aid the Jedi in their expedition, by adding the Widowmaker to their arsenal."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Aiding the Jedi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, while a portion of the expedition team landed on the planet of Munlali Mafir in the Unknown Regions, Yage remained in orbit aboard the Widowmaker.

Soon the Chiss made contact with Yage personally, demanding she arrange an audience with Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the audience with the Chiss, Yage was astounded by the Chiss commanders rudeness, and advised against complying with her suggestion to journey to Csilla.
