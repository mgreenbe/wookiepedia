He was the chief of a Karran village, and was Doctor Elth Nardah's primary contact on the planet when the Alliance to Restore the Republic attempted to broker an alliance with the Karran people against the Galactic Empire. He attempted to learn how to use blasters but due to the limitations of his four-fingered paws, he was unable to fire them effectively. The Karran believed his species would be able to defeat the Imperials by strength alone, but Doctor Nardah attempted to persuade him that they needed the Rebel Alliance's help."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tist was present with six other Karran warriors when Nardah and a group of Rebels came across the wrecked Lambda shuttle of Governor Darryn Edalm. Incensed that the Doctor would take an Imperial prisoner instead of killing him, Tist and the others turned on the Rebels. He managed to kill Nardah before the Rebels eliminated the Karrans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
