Spanjaf's parents, Gandr and Jessa, approved of her time with this club, feeling it was a better use of her time than playing grav-ball her riding her jumpspeeder with boys. Both were unaware that their daughter was, in fact, actually engaged in illicit intrusive activities of her own. Participation in the club was, in fact, a cover by Spanjaf for her illicit activities in aiding her boyfriend Zare Leonis to discover the truth beyond the disappearance of his sister, Dhara, who had been training to serve the Galactic Empire at Lothal's Academy for Young Imperials. Whether any such club actually existed was unknown."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
