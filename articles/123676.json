The group raided Human worlds 15% more often than non-Human worlds and was always on the move. They would repair and use any combat ships that they found and scavenged other ships for parts. Only very rarely did they sell captured cargoes on the black market, as they instead used all captured items to support the Shadow Wing fleet. The Shadow Wing usually left their victims alive, only killing those who resisted them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Composition"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Shadow Wing was lead by the Tiss'shar Abin-Ral-Xufush, a former trader. The group numbered about 2,000 pirates, including members of a number of smaller pirate gangs that had been absorbed into it.
