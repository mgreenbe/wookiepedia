They were independently programmed, answering to no masters, but could be programmed to serve one or more masters. The company Holowan Laboratories produced a model of assassin droid known as the IG-86 sentinel droid, which were used as enforcers by criminal elements. Other assassin droids included the BT-1 assassin droids and 0-0-0 produced by the Galactic Empire's Tarkin Initiative, and the droid bounty hunters IG-88, IG-90, and IG-11. The Imperial Security Bureau and Imperial Army Intelligence utilized the E522 assassin droid for use of black op missions.
