Molecularly bonded to a ship's hull, they provided exceptional protection over standard durasteel at the expense of maneuverability, being applicable to craft of all sizes. The CC-7700/E interdiction cruiser made use of carbon-nanofilament armor to greatly increase its defensive ability; it was thought that it would take a TIE fighter traveling near its top speed to even begin to ram through the plating."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
