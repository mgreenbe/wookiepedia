Tal'benes was a short, dark-furred Bothan who commonly touched his goatee in a tic. Like most of the people in Darkside, he was a grumpy person, commonly angry because he was sent unqualified employees for his technical needs. He usually ended the working day in drunken stupor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Staff rotation in Darkside was high, to Tal'benes's chagrin: He commonly had to train newcomers. In 32 BBY, people working under his command included Karlo, main cook; Dina Mertz, chief technical officer; and Nala Noos, recently-named acting security chief after the previous one left in a hurry in a non-uncommon occurrence. Occasionally, smuggler Xav Verivax went to Darkside to provide consultant services and improve the security of Darkside's ships smuggling details, but Verivax was not under Tal'bene's orders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At that point, Nirama sent Tal'benes a team of \"newcomers\", who were really undercover agents with secret orders.
