Sometime around 4000 BBY, a group of Dark Jedi and followers of the Sith traveled to Muzara to recover the artifact. A group of Jedi Knights was alerted to their activities by the local Muza shamans, who urged them to stop the strangers. The Jedi followed the offworlders and confronted them, stopping them from using the artifact to bring evil to the Muzara system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
