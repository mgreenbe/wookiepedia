Despite rules against maintaining attachment to family, Organa was able to return to Alderaan as a Padawan. In 3666 BBY he met and fell in love with one of the daughters of House Rist, Rehanna. Their relationship was seen in a positive light by the two houses who negotiated an alliance over their marriage. The Jedi Order, however, did not approve when the news reached them and refused to engage a Jedi in local politics. On their order, Organa broke off his marriage and returned to serve the Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Twenty-three years later, during the Alderaan Civil War, a Sith named Kallig arrived on Alderaan searching for an artifact of Tulak Hord.

With the aid of Elana Thul, Kallig discovered the holorecording of Organa breaking off his engagement in the archives of House Alde. Kallig then confronted Rehanna in House Rist's fortress, coercing her into arranging to meet with Organa in the old Killik tunnels.
