The dish's ingredients were beef from a bantha, Ojomian onions, and protatoes, which were cooked together in a skillet. Jettster ate a large portion of the hash every morning during his time working as a brawler on the planet Ord Mantell, where he wrestled Mantellian Savrips. When the Besalisk later opened an eatery named Dex's Diner in the CoCo Town district of the planet Coruscant, he included the dish on the menu as a breakfast meal costing 8.5 credits with a breakfast side dish included in the price. The hash was served at the eatery prior to its destruction at some point during the first two years of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Besalisk's Bellyful\" hash was featured in \"Dining at Dex's,\" a 2009 StarWars.com Hyperspace exclusive article that was written by Gregory Walker in the style of an in-universe menu for Dex's Diner."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
