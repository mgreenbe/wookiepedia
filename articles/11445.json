Kestis quickly gained the support of BD-1, and they entered the vault. Along the way, the droid's scomp link was broken by the local wildlife.

After battling Imperial forces guarding the cave, Kestis finally acquired a new crystal, only for it to break in his hands.

The droid charged the Sith Lord and delivered a shock, but Vader shrugged it off. They only escaped by breaking the tunnel and escaping in the onrush of water.
