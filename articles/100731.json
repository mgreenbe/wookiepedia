The eventual intent of the campaign was to disable the heart of the Empire's ship-building operations, the Kuat Drive Yards. Eventually, however, Twilight Company abandoned the campaign in favor of assisting the Sullustan people in the aftermath of the Siege of Inyusu Tor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Towards the end of the Mid Rim Retreat, in 3 ABY, First Sergeant Hazram Namir of the Rebel Alliance's 61st Mobile Infantry and his squad extracted the defecting Governor of Haidoral Prime Everi Chalis. She offered to help the alliance with her knowledge on the \"Imperial War Machine\". Her knowledge helped them in the Coyerti campaign and when they were being tracked by imperial forces shortly after. She, Captain Micha Evon, Namir and two others were then invited to Echo Base on Hoth by the Alliance High Command. She was at center stage in a strategy conference that went well before the Imperials discovered the base. The Battle of Hoth broke out and Captain Evon and the two Twilight Soldiers were killed. Chalis and Namir escaped with her old imperial clearance codes. At the same time, the rest of Twilight Company lost the rest of their officers when their CR90 corvette the Thunderstrike was Infiltrated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the loss of their leadership, Twilight Company retreated to Ankhural where they were reunited with Chalis and Namir. They honoured their losses and repaired the Thunderstrike. Some soldiers considered quitting fearing the imperials would find and destroy them if they stayed. Chalis however thought of a strategic way to use the four-hundred soldiers they had and proposed Operation Ringbreaker. This was a strategic campaign which would see to the destruction of Kuat Drive Yards if it went as planned. Before Kuat, they would attack a number of imperial installments to distract ships from there and since many ships were chasing the rebellion into the Outer Rim Territories after the clash on Hoth, this would be easy. Namir took command of Twilight Company and the other senior personnel, including the officers of the Braha'tok-class gunship Apailana's Promise agreed with the plan. They would soon launch the campaign."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The campaign"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Initial attacks"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Twilight's first target was the warehouse world of Mardona III, they battled through the underground installments and planted mines, while facing an unidentified armored worm vehicle which had killed one of Twilight's sergeants, Charmer. The attack was ultimately successful and Twilight continued to its next target, Obumubo. The Attack on Obumubo was also successful and Twilight moved onto the Dockyards of Najan-Rovi, where it obliterated the underfunded defenses destroyed almost a hundred Imperial luxury transports. The next attack on Nakadia targeted the plastic factories there and had a rough start at first due to use of biological weapons at the hands of the Imperials. They won and moved to Naator, Xagobah and then the Kuliquo belt, where they sent out twenty soldiers to sabotage machinery."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Fall at Sullust"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the successes of the first attacks, Twilight attacked the factory of Inyusu Tor on Sullust near its capital of Pinyumb. They successfully captured the place but as the Thunderstrike came to pick them up, it was ambushed and shot down by a swarm of TIE Fighters. The Apailana's Promise retreated leaving the ground forces stranded. Namir then had two squads go to Pinyumb to meet with the Sullustan resistance but they had too little resources to help. Namir returned to find the Imperial Star Destroyer Herald had arrived. Imperial ground forces then advanced and Chalis abandoned Twilight Company during the clash. She took a stolen shuttle up to the Herald and set off ion mines inside to take out from the battle. The Apailana's Promise had returned to help and the imperial ground forces were overwhelmed. Once the last of the Imperial forces were dealt with, revolts broke out all over Sullust and Twilight Company had liberated it. Due to their heavy losses, they were forced to abandon Operation Ringbreaker, which was planned to include two more attacks, one on Malastare and the last on Kuat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Operation Ringbreaker appeared in Alexander Freed's 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
