Through his work, Jelph developed a good reputation for producing high-quality fertilizers and eventually befriended Orielle Kitai, a Sith Saber and the aristocratic daughter of High Lord Candra Kitai.

Upon learning that Orielle had uncovered his secret, Jelph followed her to Tahv and confronted her at the city's waterworks.

Arriving at the planet Kesh, the former Covenant Shadow's spacecraft was caught in one of the planet's heavy meteor showers and crashed in a remote jungle on the planet. Marrian would learn that Kesh was ruled by the Lost Tribe of Sith, a group of stranded Human Sith who had settled on the planet during the Great Hyperspace War in 5000 BBY. The Tribe had also subjugated the native Keshiri, a purple-skinned humanoid species who had been reduced to the status of serfs.

Marrian assumed the persona of a slave and eventually ended up working as a horticulturist on an isolated smallholding by the banks of the Marisota River, from which he took the name of \"Jelph of Marisota\". He produced fertilized soil from Kesh's black mud, mixed with uvak manure and clay from the river, and would trade it with gardeners of the native Keshiri inhabitants. Aside from the fertilizer, Marrian also cultivated dalsa flowers on hejarbo-shoot trellises behind his house. Besides working as a horticulturist during the day, Marrian also spent the night repairing his damaged Aurek starfighter. He dismantled it and had it painstakingly brought piece by piece to his homestead. Marrian hid the starfighter beneath a heap of dung in a former uvak stable. By 3960 BBY, he had succeeded in reassembling the starfighter except for its communications console. As a safety precaution against discovery, Marrian also rigged the starfighter to two proton torpedoes and thousands of kilograms of ammonium-nitrate explosives.

The Sith woman had been purchasing flowers for Donellan's Day, a holiday which commemorated Donellan, the son of Grand Lord Nida Korsin who never ascended to the throne since his mother had outlived him. Orielle and her mother Candra needed these flowers to decorate their booth at the arena Korsinata during the rake-riding games.

After the pair discussed the history of Donellan's Day while Marrian had been gathering the flowers, the slave presented Kitai with a gift of a yoke mated to a saddle for an uvak beast of burden.

During that year's Donellan's Day, Ori and Candra had sponsored a certain rake-rider by the name of Campion Dey. Rake-riding was a violent blood sport which pitted rival uvaks, which had their wing muscles severed at birth. Unknown to his sponsors, Dey had plans to assassinate the reigning Grand Lord Lillia Venn, who had recently been elected from among the seven High Lords the previous year. Ultimately, Dey's assassination attempt failed and he was captured by the Sith authorities. Due to their connections with Dey, Candra and her family were accused of staging the assassination attempt. As punishment, Grand Lord Venn ordered that the Kitai family be reduced to the status of slaves and stripped of all their possessions and titles. Consequently, Ori lost her status as a Sith Saber while her mother was forced to shove uvak manure at the capital Tahv's zoo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With her life in ruins, Ori turned to her best friend Jelph for comfort and support.

Since slaves and Keshiri were banned from owning the winged reptilian steeds, this was a potential source of trouble. In the end, Jelph managed to hid Shyn inside his composting barn which had previously been a stable. During this period of grief, Marrian looked after Ori by providing her with cool river water and wash rags for her ablutions. While conversing with Ori, Jelph learnt about the complexities and subtleties of the Tribe's politics.

Marrian argued that if the Grand Lord did not staged her own assassination attempt and really suspected her mother, she would have ordered her family's execution. Jelph reasoned that the Grand Lord had spared her family's lives so that it could make a public example of her rivals. He also advised Ori not to thwart Lillia Venn as long as she could sense that her mother was not suffering. Ori initially disbelieved Marrian's arguments but quickly realized that they made sense. She then allowed him to help her back up when she lost her footing near the riverbank."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Ori's time at his farm, Jelph noticed some subtle changes in her character. While he had earlier recalled that the Sith woman had been proud, arrogant and self-indulgent prior to the recent events, he noted that Ori was actually tentative and unsure. She also grieved the loss of her former privileged status. He also pondered whether Ori had showed signs of humility, an attribute unknown to the Sith. He sensed that her anger was fueled by injustice rather than a lust for violence.

Through Keshiri traders, the pair had learnt that Ori was hiding with her friend Marrian in the jungle. They quickly killed Ori's uvak on the pretext that slaves were not allowed to own uvaks, a tradition which had lasted since 4975 BBY. The Luzo brothers also revealed that Candra had confessed under duress to plotting against the Grand Lord with Dernas and Pallima, the leaders of the Red and Gold Factions. These two former High Lords had been executed for their role in the plot.

She quickly saw the opportunity to use this discovery to regain her family's lost social standing. For millennia, the Tribe had sought to return to the stars but lacked any hyperspace-capable starships.

Fearing that the Tribe would pose a danger to the galaxy if they rediscovered hyperspace travel, Marrian resolved to pursue Ori and stop her before she could reveal the starship's existence to her Sith compatriots.

After running for an entire day, he stopped by a bar owned by a Keshiri bartender. To cope with his stress and anxiety, Jelph ordered a mug of sweetwater . The bartender was warm and sympathetic to the tired Human slave. The Keshiri were able to interact more easily with Human slaves like him than with their Sith overlords. While having a meal, Marrian contemplated on his early Jedi career and his experiences as a Jedi Shadow.

He was uncomfortable with the strong presence of the dark side in that city. He overheard an elderly Sith man violently castigating his Keshiri slave. Opposite, he also eavesdropped on a Sith couple plotting the deaths of their neighbors. While reading through the minds of a passing sentry, Jelph was greatly disturbed by the man's malevolent thoughts and memories. Jelph attempted to shut out these psychic impressions with his Force powers but this was impossible since the various Sith broadcast their feelings frequently."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Still, Jelph was determined to find Ori and to put a stop to her plans.

Ori was initially angry to see him and blamed him for the misfortunes that had befallen her. She was angry with him for withholding his offworld origins from her. Marrian admitted his plans to return to the stars. By then, Ori had already informed her mother about the existence of Jelph's starship. At her mother's suggestion, Ori had also informed the architect Gadin Badolfa, who had close ties to members of the Red and Gold factions. Marrian attempted to reason with Ori by telling her that she was not power-hungry by nature unlike the other Sith. Ori angrily retorted that she had not been herself and had succumbed to defeat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jelph replied that he personally liked her for her good attributes. Ori tried to deny these attributes by stressing her Sith identity and her Tribe's ambitions of returning to the stars. Jelph countered by claiming that there were no more Sith in the wider galaxy. When Ori counter-argued that Marrian's ship was a military starfighter, he acknowledged that a Sith known as Exar Kun had triggered the Great Sith War but that he and his followers had been eradicated by the Jedi.

Jelph consoled Ori by telling her that she could be strong but that she did not need to rule the galaxy.

Candra did not believe that her daughter's discovery actually existed and did not think that the other High Lords would be interested.

This distraction gave Jelph enough time to emerge from the farmhouse and open fire on Venn's entourage. The Sith Sabers were unfamiliar with blaster technology and a few were struck down.
