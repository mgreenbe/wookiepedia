In that year, he was among a group of Knights who acted as bodyguards for Emperor Roan Fel of the Empire-in-exile as Fel met with several Jedi on the planet Agamar to negotiate an alliance against Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire. Everyone present wore a farmer disguise, and the black-haired male was one of several Knights who stood apart from the talks and pretended to work on a nearby field. When a Sith strike force attacked the gathering, the black-haired male helped fight them off.

The Emperor traveled to the planet Agamar in 137 ABY to meet with members of the Jedi Order, and the black-haired male was one of many Imperial Knights who served as bodyguards for Fel on the mission. Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire was a common enemy of both the Empire-in-Exile and the Jedi, and Fel hoped to forge an alliance against Krayt's forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Agamar's grassy plains, everyone present donned a farmer disguise, and several Imperial Knight Masters stood with Fel as he negotiated with Jedi Master K'Kruhk. The black-haired male and several other Imperial Knights stood away from the main group and promoted their farmer deception by masquerading as workers tending to a nearby field. After Fel and K'Kruhk reached an agreement, Nyna Calixte\u2014the Director of Imperial Intelligence for Krayt's Empire, and secretly an ally of Fel's\u2014rode into the field on a local animal. She crashed to a halt after two Imperial Knights fired blaster rifles at her steed; she then quickly told the assembled parties that Krayt's Sith were aware of the meeting and that a Sith\u2013Imperial task force was on its way to capture or kill the Emperor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A group of Sith then rose from an adjacent swamp, and Antares Draco, the leader of the Imperial Knights, called on his charges to defend their Emperor. The black-haired male ignited his lightsaber, and all farmer disguises were jettisoned as a melee ensued. Newly-allied Jedi and Imperial Knights fought off the attackers, and at least ten Sith fell to their blades and to Calixte's blaster. Several Jedi and Imperial Knights died as well, but the Emperor and most of the survivors were able to evacuate the planet on the escape shuttle Defender One."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As an Imperial Knight, the black-haired male was part of an order whose membership was limited to those who could use the Force. The Imperial Knights were dedicated to protecting the Emperor and preserving his Empire, and were considered to be among the most talented and dangerous Force-users in the galaxy. The black-haired male fought against a group of Sith on Agamar with a standard Imperial Knight lightsaber and while wearing Imperial Knight armor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Created by John Ostrander and Jan Duursema, the black-haired male first appeared in the forty-fifth issue of the comic series Star Wars: Legacy as an Agamarian farmer working on a field.

The five Knights appeared in a single panel, and their fate following the battle was not revealed.
