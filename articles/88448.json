These could often be used up to ten times before needing to be restocked with supplies. The compact packages were designed to provide a trained medic with the tools necessary for field care, yet also allowed untrained users to provide emergency care."}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Medkits contained diagnostic instruments that could be used to detect both injuries and diseases. The scanner/computer unit was placed directly on the patient and automatically gave simple directions for care and treatment of injuries, unless the user keyed in a specific sequence to indicate their advanced medical training. The medical computer was not without limits however. Because of their simple design and focus on user-friendliness, the units were usually programmable for diagnosing only one species at a time. Additionally, the kits usually included a hypospray with several medical vials, a spray splint and bandage, a sonic scalpel, laser cauterizer, bone stabilizer compound, and a basic sample analyzer with a few sample vials."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Medkits were often used aboard starships and worked better than medpacs according to Platt Okeefe.
