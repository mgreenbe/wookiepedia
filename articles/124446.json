During the Clone Wars, the clone riot troopers of the Coruscant Guard used riot shields in conjunction with a baton. Later, clone troopers utilized a type of shield in the Battle of Ringo Vinda. The shield was made of a blaster-proof material. It was strong enough to withstand and deflect strong sustained hits from blaster fire, but was also light enough to be used in conjunction with a DC-15A blaster carbine. After the rise of the Galactic Empire, the riot gear used by the stormtroopers of the Empire also included a shield. The Wookiee warriors of Kashyyyk used wooden battle shields that had a reverse teardrop shape. Maz Kanata's collection of antique items included a shield fashioned of an unknown silvery metal. The Kyuzo warriors wore helmets that doubled as shields and as missiles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
