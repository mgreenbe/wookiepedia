Serving as a corporal in the Rebel Alliance Special Forces, Casrich was one of several volunteers who joined an improvised squad of rebel fighters, codenamed \"Rogue One,\" who took it upon themselves to steal the plans of the Imperial superweapon known as the Death Star. While the mission was a success, Casrich and the rest of his team lost their lives in the opening battle of the war. Casrich was a thrill seeker and reckless fighter.
