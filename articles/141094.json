During the Clone Wars, the clone trooper known as Echo was hooked up to this computer (also while in stasis) and the computer was able to extract information from his brain, including Rex's battle strategy algorithm. Essentially made a cyborg, the interface worked both ways and Echo was able to learn the layout of the research facility due to his long connection to the computer. The computer was also cooled with a giant vent system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
