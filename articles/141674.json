During the mission, she realized that she was in love with Jacen Solo, though he was captured by Vergere and taken into Yuuzhan Vong custody. She survived the mission, and later became Queen Mother of Hapes against her personal wishes, and a year later she learned that Jacen had indeed survived Myrkr. During the Killik crisis in 36 ABY, Tenel Ka agreed to send Jacen Solo a fleet to aid the Killiks, which were now under the leadership of former friend, Raynar Thul.

During the Battle of Kashyyyk, she turned against Jacen, horrified by his actions. This caused Jacen to value Allana's life far more than Tenel Ka's to the point that Jacen was prepared to kill Tenel Ka if she attempted to keep Allana from him. He later kidnapped Allana to force Tenel Ka back into an alliance, though upon Tenel Ka's urgent request, she was rescued by Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Leia Organa Solo.

With his help, Tenel Ka and Allana managed to escape the nanovirus, though Tenel Ka realized the Hapan style of life was not meant for Allana. With that, she requested that Han and Leia take her to the Jedi Academy on Shedu Maad and raise her outside the machinations of Hapan politics.

She was unsettled and embarrassed to learn from the teasing Jedi Master that upon meeting him, Teneniel had captured Luke. Tenel Ka was chagrined at the very thought of him submitting to the Dathomir marriage customs that she had always viewed as quaint and provincial.

Tenel Ka refused, and kicked Tamith Kai hard in the unprotected kneecap, shattering it and sending her tumbling down the boarding ramp of the ship. At this time, things were said and done that would lead to much enmity between the Jedi trainee and Nightsister.

Because she had had experience with the Karnak Alphans and their odd customs due to her royal upbringing, Tenel Ka managed, with Anakin Solo's assistance, to have an important Karnak Alphan dinner custom performed.

Tenel Ka struggled with the importance of a lightsaber, believing that it was the warrior's skill that mattered, and not their weapon. While her friends began constructing their lightsabers, Tenel Ka set out doing rigorous physical training to prove to herself that she was able to handle a lightsaber, and upon hearing from Lowbacca that the three were nearly complete, began creating her own."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tenel Ka considered several options for the lightsaber handle, wanting something suitable for a warrior of Dathomir, thinking of the rancor as the appropriate symbol.

The two treasured possessions would be of the right shape and size."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Lowbacca flying her to a volcano, Tenel Ka traveled down a lava tube and found the crystals within that she used as her lightsaber's focusing crystals. Back at the temple, Tenel Ka realized the tooth's hollow that she had chosen was a little too small for the crystal arrangement she had hoped for. Her closer inspection also revealed a tiny flaw in each hazy volcanic crystal, but decided to make do as her sense of competition urged her to complete its construction quickly. Her blade was a white-gray color due to the volcano's crystals. During an exercise designed by Luke Skywalker in which Tenel Ka and her friends had to wear visors that made laser remotes invisible, Tenel Ka used the Force to deflect the bolts aimed at her and was the only one to slice her remote in half."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Luke Skywalker supervising, Tenel Ka then began her first lightsaber sparring exercise with Jacen Solo, where Tenel Ka found herself approving of her friend's skill. After switching to their left hand, their blades clashed and became locked against each other. The stress of pushing back caused the components inside the tooth to vibrate, quickly escalating to cause the handle itself to rattle. Although unsettled to how her weapon was now feeling in her hand, Tenel Ka ignored it. With a sharp crack, her lightsaber components failed, but Jacen didn't notice and kept pushing. The power source overloaded with a shriek and suddenly quit. The blade disappeared, and Jacen's pushed right through the now empty air, and through flesh and bone, severing her left arm just above the elbow. Tenel Ka could see as her lightsaber hit the ground and explode in her dismembered hand, rendering it unable to be reattached. The accident drastically changed their relationship, especially in light of the fact that, prior to the accident, Jacen had hoped they would become more than friends. Tenel Ka fell unconscious before she hit the ground. She was quickly brought back to the Jedi academy by Skywalker, who managed to keep the Solos and Lowbacca from Tenel Ka to protect her secret that she was the Hapan princess.

Tenel Ka was greeted by her grandmother Ta'a Chume, who prepared a show for her arrival. Gorgeous, nearly naked young men, muscular and dressed only in skimpy loincloths, performed a gymnastics show for Tenel Ka, while other scantily clad male servants provided music nearby. Later in the medical room, Tenel Ka briefly considered whether she should continue to train as a Jedi, but in a display of personal strength and confidence, Tenel Ka refused to have the temporary droid arm (which she Force pushed into the opposite wall), nor the prosthetic replacement her grandmother had arranged for her to be attached, and sought to enhance her physical abilities along with her Jedi talents to make up for her loss."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after, Jacen and the others arrived and sought to comfort Tenel Ka, and asked her why she hadn't told them she was a princess.

Then after foiling a plot by one of Ta'a Chume's ambassadors to kill her and her grandmother, she decided that her path was definitely one of a Jedi. She returned to the Jedi academy and constructed a second lightsaber from relics of both sides of her family: The second, larger rancor tooth and choice Rainbow gems picked out from the remains of the tiara of the Royal Princess of Hapes (accepted by her on Ta'a Chume's insistence that she'd take it back to Yavin 4), which she had smashed apart with the tooth. This lightsaber was carefully constructed and produced a turquoise blade.
