In 22 BBY during the Clone Wars, after the loss of a Republic task force in the Abregado system, the Republic learned about the Malevolence, a Subjugator-class heavy cruiser constructed by Free Dac Volunteers Engineering Corps for the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The warship possessed twin ion cannons that were capable of disabling enemy ships. Jedi General Anakin Skywalker devised a plan to stop the Confederate cruiser from destroying the Kaliida Shoals Medical Center, which the commander of the Malevolence, General Grievous, had taken as his next target.
