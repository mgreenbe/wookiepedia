He often enjoyed watching Duros Jedi Master Wishan sculpt clay using the Force. After watching Wishan sculpt four statues for the Jedi Temple's librarian, Rann attempted to sculpt Master Wishan using seven lumps of clay, but all of his attempts ended up looking like frog-dogs holding bones in their mouths. After noticing a padawan attempting to steal one of Wishan's figures, Rann sculpted a giant dragon skeleton which scared off the padawan. Seconds after scaring the padawan, Rann lost concentration which caused the dragon sculpture to collapse, much to the amusement of Master Wishan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
