When the New Republic captured the galactic capital of Coruscant, Dlarit provided Horn's starfighter codes to Isard, which resulted in Horn's capture and imprisonment aboard Isard's Executor-class Star Dreadnought flagship, the Lusankya. As Coruscant became devastated by Isard's genetically engineered bioweapon, the Krytos virus, Dlarit helped slow down treatment of the disease by betraying a bacta convoy in the Alderaan system to Warlord Zsinj, who subsequently destroyed the convoy.

Dlarit led an attack on an unarmed civilian colony at Halanit that had purchased bacta from Rogue Squadron. It proved to be a massacre, but Dlarit felt no remorse for the victims. Dlarit began to grow disillusioned with Isard's arrogance and instability, and plotted with Vorru to abandon her.

Her father, Aerin Dlarit, and the rest of her family were prominent members of the Xucphra Corporation, one of the two conglomerates which, along with the rival Zaltin Corporation, held a monopoly on the production and refinement of ninety-five percent of the galaxy's supply of the medical substance bacta. Her uncle was a prominent investigator for the company. The members of the Dlarit family were made multi-millionaires through their position with Xucphra, and Erisi grew up in a life of luxury as a result. Her childhood home, the Dlarit estate, was an enormous and visually stunning mansion in a remote location among the Thyferran rainforests, complete with servant staff, elaborate security measures, and a gigantic mountain backdrop with gorgeous cascading waterfalls. Like her father, Erisi reveled in the comforts and status that her wealth afforded her, and she treated the opportunity and material advantages afforded to her as if they were her due. As a result, she developed a blithe disregard for money and a strong sense of superiority over those she considered below her social class."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bacta cartels remained officially neutral throughout the Galactic Civil War. However, since it was Imperial decrees that allowed the bacta cartels to develop their monopoly, Xucphra harbored secret loyalties toward the Galactic Empire. The Dlarit family shared similar leanings, although their first and foremost loyalty was toward themselves. Erisi grew to develop a strong passion and conviction for the Xucphra Corporation, as well as a genuine love for her home planet of Thyferra. She also developed an equally strong hatred for the Ashern, a movement of the Vratix, the native Thyferran species. The Ashern rebelled against the Xucphra and Zaltin Corporations after growing disenchanted with the Human control over the bacta cartel. Erisi and her family considered them nothing more than murderous traitors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dlarit was expected to continue in the family tradition of Xucphra service. However, although she was loyal to the family, she preferred a more adventurous life, and she began to learn starfighter piloting skills. After the tide of the Galactic Civil War turned in favor of the Alliance to Restore the Republic following the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, the Dlarit family feared that their grip on power might be jeopardized. Since their monopoly was formed under the Empire, they feared it might be dissolved under the New Republic form of government. As a result, the Dlarit family became involved with Ysanne Isard, the Director of Imperial Intelligence and de facto leader of the Empire. Erisi Dlarit agreed to serve as a high-placed Imperial spy. By now Dlarit had become an excellent starfighter pilot, and Isard plotted to plant Dlarit in an important position in the New Republic Defense Force, from where she would report directly to Isard."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early Rogue Squadron career"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Assignment to Rogue Squadron"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dlarit was one of eleven pilots hand-picked by Commander Wedge Antilles to join the elite Rogue Squadron when he reformed the famed squad in 6.5 ABY. Dlarit underwent many hours of X-wing simulator training to prepare for the assignment. Her appointment was in part political, as the New Republic sought to place a representative from both the Xucphra and Zaltin Corporations in the squadron to appease both bacta conglomerates. Likewise, Bror Jace, a prominent member of the Zaltin Corporation, was placed in Rogue Squadron as well. However, Antilles assured Admiral Ackbar, the Supreme Commander of the New Republic Defense Force, that none of the pilots selected for political reasons were inferior to any other candidates. Neither Antilles nor any of the other Rogue pilots displayed any visible resentment toward Dlarit for the political decisions from which she benefited. Due to her assignment to the elite squadron, many Thyferrans came to consider Dlarit a hero."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although secretly serving Ysanne Isard, Dlarit ostensibly claimed she believed so strongly in the cause for the New Republic that she was willing to leave her life of luxury and security to serve higher ideals. Dlarit was given the call sign Rogue Eight, and fellow pilot Rhysati Ynr became her roommate and wingmate. Nawara Ven, a fellow Rogue pilot and Ynr's lover, believed that the two women would develop a sense of jealousy and competition, but that proved not to be the case, as Dlarit and Ynr got along very well. During Rogue Squadron training exercises, Dlarit tended to perform among the middle of the pack, outperforming such pilots as Lujayne Forge and Peshk Vri'syk, but failing to match the talent of pilots Jace and Corran Horn. She readily and publicly acknowledged that she was not among the best of Rogue Squadron's pilots."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During this time, Dlarit developed a romantic interest in Horn, and acted in an openly flirtatious manner with him. During a training run on Folor, Antilles secretly provided Horn's targeting data to the other Rogues, allowing them to get higher scores at Horn's expense. Afterward, when the Rogue pilots felt badly about the lesson, Dlarit volunteered to personally invite Horn to the DownTime tapcafe, where he bought her a drink.

The mission was to protect the Battle of Yavin\u2014a New Republic frigate that had crash-landed on Hensara III\u2014from capture by the Imperial Strike-class cruiser Havoc. The battle was a Rogue Squadron victory with no casualties among their ranks, and Dlarit scored at least two individual kills. Shortly thereafter, the squad was moved to a training base on Talasea, which was intended to serve as a staging area for an eventual move against the Imperial-occupied galactic capital of Coruscant, due to the planet's proximity to the Galactic Core. One night, however, a platoon of Imperial stormtroopers was dispatched by Admiral Devlia to attack the base, based on information provided by Imperial Intelligence agent Kirtan Loor, who deduced it himself by reviewing raw intelligence data. Dlarit escaped the attack unscathed, but Lujayne Forge was killed in her sleep, while Horn and fellow Rogue Squadron pilots Gavin Darklighter and Andoorni Hui suffered serious injuries during the assault. Dlarit attended Forge's funeral, and the loss of Forge severely damaged the squadron's morale."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dlarit participated in a retaliatory strike against Devlia and his forces at the Grand Isle, his base on the planet Vladet.

Once the bombing was complete, however, the Imperial Carrack-class cruiser Expeditious and Lancer-class frigate Ravager dropped out of hyperspace, leaving the New Republic starfighters and their CR90 Corellian Corvette Eridain outgunned. The New Republic forces were saved by a plan put forth by Horn, who had the Y-wing squad Warden Squadron target his own X-wing with their proton torpedoes, before flying directly toward the Ravager and diving under it at the last minute, causing thirty-two torpedoes to strike and destroy the ship.

While he did not explicitly rule out a romantic relationship with Dlarit at a later date, Horn rebuffed her advances, claiming that he did not want to get involved with someone in the squadron. Dlarit encountered Terrik while leaving Horn's quarters. In direct contrast to her warm and friendly nature toward Horn, Dlarit was cold and rude to Terrik, trying to discourage her from visiting Horn by claiming that he could not see civilian visitors.

However, due to recent security leaks to Ysanne Isard, who had accelerated her counterintelligence efforts against the New Republic in recent months, the identity of the planet and other basic information about the mission parameters were kept confidential from the military forces. Even Antilles and Salm were kept in the dark about the details\u2014Borleias itself was identified during the mission only by the codename Blackmoon. These security measures successfully prevented Dlarit from providing Imperial Intelligence any critical information about the assault.

Though she expressed sadness and regret with being unable to join the other Rogues in battle, she helped them prepare by participating in simulator exercises with them. Due to the continued security measures, Dlarit and most of her colleagues remained unaware of the name of the planet, let alone any further details. Before the battle began, she repeatedly tried to trick Horn into giving up information, at one point claiming she wanted to know where the planet was so she could establish a memorial for Horn and the others in case they died there. However, she was unable to obtain any information, and Horn did not take notice of her attempts. Just before the battle began, Dlarit tried to persuade Terrik to stay away from Horn by promising to use her Xucphra connections to assist Terrik in smuggling if she complied and threatening to use those same connections to end Terrik's career if she did not.

Dlarit passed this information on to Isard with the hopes that Jace would be killed, something that would improve her standing as an Imperial spy and also serve as a blow to the Zaltin Corporation.

To that end, he had meant to destroy the starfighter himself and fake his death. Jace had previously told Dlarit about his return home with the specific intention that the Xucphra watch for his return and receive news of his supposed death. Dlarit's betrayal of Jace and the subsequent Black Asp attack only provided further cover for his plans, and the truth of his survival was not publicly known for several more months.

During the battle, the squadron engaged Zsinj's transport ship, Contruum's Pride, which led to a battle with the ship's TIE fighters and interceptors. Dlarit's X-wing was targeted by one of the interceptors and she had difficulty evading it, but was saved by assistance from Nunb. The battle at Mrisst ended in a victory for the New Republic with no casualties. Afterward, Wedge Antilles pulled Horn and Dlarit aside and gave them instructions for a secret mission to Coruscant, which remained under Imperial control.

But Antilles neither confirmed nor denied her suspicions, revealing only that Horn and Dlarit would be working as part of a cell system, through which no one was allowed to know about more than their portion of the network. These security measures, meant to protect the mission from security leaks, were so strong that even Antilles did not know about Horn and Dlarit's travel arrangements to Coruscant.

In private, Dlarit was apologetic for having to treat Horn this way, but Horn felt that at some level, Dlarit did genuinely feel socially superior and entitled to her preferential treatment due to her wealthy Thyferran upbringing. The sexual tension between Horn and Dlarit further developed as they spent more time together, but Horn continued to resist her advances because he did not want to let his guard down and endanger the mission.

Horn and Dlarit began their reconnaissance mission, all the while maintaining their roles as Kuati and telbun. Per his role, Horn acted in a submissive fashion while in public with Dlarit, trailing her respectfully, paying for things she bought, and carrying her belongings. During their first few nights on Coruscant, Winter had Horn and Dlarit monitored by a team to ensure that no Imperials were taking an interest in them. They spent the next week studying the basic security and peacekeeping forces on Coruscant, as well as the medical services and facilities.

Later, Dlarit was reunited with Rogue Squadron, and she was partnered with her roommate Rhyasti Ynr rather than Horn. The Rogues were assigned to take down Coruscant's planetary shields in preparation for an invasion. The squadron was assigned to infiltrate an Imperial warehouse to obtain memory cores, which were to be used to gain access to Coruscant's central computer system. However, the warehouse mission was compromised due to information relayed to Kirtan Loor by the Imperial spy Zekka Thyne, a criminal who had been recruited to help Rogue Squadron on their Coruscant mission.

Dlarit was one of five pilots assigned to provide air cover in Z-95 Headhunters, with Horn taking the lead among them. Before the mission began, Horn confronted Celchu, whom Horn was convinced was the Imperial spy in their midst. After the confrontation, Horn told Dlarit that he planned to make exposing the spy his priority after the mission ended. Concerned that this would result in her eventual exposure, Dlarit arranged to help Horn check over his Z-95 Headhunter before the flight, obtaining the fighter's codes. Wedge Antilles did not allow outside contact prior to the engagement, so she was unable to warn Isard about the plan to take down Coruscant's shields. However, she was able to transfer Horn's starfighter codes to Isard during the battle so that Isard could take control of the ship during combat and subsequently capture or kill Horn.

While the Rogues believed Horn dead, he was placed in the Lusankya prison\u2014a facility aboard Isard's flagship, an Executor-class Star Dreadnought also called Lusankya, that was buried underneath the surface of Coruscant. Despite Horn's supposed death, the Rogue Squadron victory allowed the New Republic to take control of Coruscant. Shortly thereafter, however, Isard released the Krytos virus, a devastating bioweapon that she had specifically engineered to infect only alien species.

Later, she participated in Rogue Squadron's successful attempt at the planet Yag'Dhul to a recapture a large Zaltin bacta supply that had been seized by Warlord Zsinj. The New Republic was notified about the stolen bacta by Qlaern Hirf, an Ashern Vratix who was aboard the convoy at the time of the theft. During the battle, Dlarit and Ynr engaged the TIE Fighters patrolling Yag-prime, an Empress-class space station orbiting Yag'Dhul.

Antilles insisted that he had no information about the Vratix, but promised to pass her concerns along to General Airen Cracken, head of the New Republic Intelligence Service. Later, Qlaern Hirf approached Antilles and offered to develop the medication rylca to combat the Krytos virus, with the hopes that Antilles would help the Vratix join the New Republic in exchange.

Under questioning from Ettyk, Dlarit described the suspicion with which Horn had viewed Celchu during their time on Coruscant, as well as the fact that he had publicly confronted Celchu just before the mission wherein Horn was eventually killed. Her testimony was damaging for Celchu and provided herself further cover, since he was on trial for some of the security leaks for which she was in fact responsible. When the court recessed, the Rogues were assigned a mission to Ryloth to purchase a large quantity of ryll kor, a rare grade of the spice ryll to be used for production of rylca. Antilles, Cracken, and New Republic Chief of State Mon Mothma considered forbidding Dlarit from participating in the mission due to her Xucphra associations.

Antilles did not believe the high-profile squadron was ideal for the secret mission because they were bound to be watched, but Provisional Councilor Borsk Fey'lya and others felt that having Dlarit participate in the convoy escort would send a positive message to the Thyferrans. Dlarit betrayed the location of the bacta convoy to Isard, in part because the destruction of the convoy would lower the New Republic morale on Coruscant and allow Xucphra to drive their prices up even higher. Additionally, Mirax Terrik and her ship, the Pulsar Skate, were expected to be among the convoy, and Dlarit sought to kill her over their past rivalry regarding Corran Horn. Isard leaked information about the convoy to Warlord Zsinj, whose forces attacked and destroyed the convoy, although Terrik was in fact not present and thus escaped death.

Dlarit pursued a TIE Interceptor heading toward the Lusankya, ignoring Antilles' orders to break away and avoid getting close to the massive ship. Dlarit destroyed the interceptor, then claimed she was caught in the Lusankya's tractor beam and called for help, feigning fear in her voice. Several of Rogue Squadron's pilots, including Gavin Darklighter, wanted to assist her despite being heavily outgunned. Antilles, however, recognized that the effort would be fruitless and ordered the squadron to stand down as Dlarit's X-wing was taken aboard the Lusankya.

Because of Horn's supposed death, Antilles had added a subroutine to all of the Rogue pilots' astromech droids, so he was able to pull diagnostic data from Dlarit's R5 unit.

From this, he deduced that she was a spy working with Isard. Additionally, while aboard the Lusankya, Horn had learned that Tycho Celchu was not the spy; since Dlarit was the only other person who knew his Z-95 Headhunter's codes, Horn realized that she was the one who had sold him out to Isard. Horn and Antilles also reasoned that Dlarit was in a position, and had a motive, to betray Bror Jace. These revelations ultimately led to Celchu's vindication at his trial. Upon further analysis, the New Republic Intelligence Service quickly deduced that Dlarit had in fact provided very little useful information to Isard during her time as a spy.

With the New Republic still in desperate need of bacta and rylca to combat the Krytos virus, Isard believed that taking control of Thyferra and its medical production would ensure that the Krytos virus would continue to ravage Coruscant and destroy the New Republic. However, the New Republic refused to engage this new threat because it was considered to be a internal Thyferran matter, so Wedge Antilles and his Rogue Squadron pilots resigned from the New Republic to launch a private war against Isard, thus starting what became known as the Bacta War. The Rogues, especially Corran Horn, took Dlarit's betrayal personally and were particularly hateful toward her. Privately, however, Antilles felt a small degree of admiration mixed with his anger for Dlarit, based on how well she had hidden her role as an Imperial spy through very difficult situations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Isard established the Thyferran Home Defense Corps, a defense organization of Xucphra volunteers established to work in conjunction with the ground-based stormtroopers to defend the planet. Isard placed Dlarit in command of the Defense Corps' fighter wing; she made this decision not only because of Dlarit's piloting skills and her knowledge of Rogue Squadron, but also for its strong symbolic value, since by now Dlarit was considered to be a hero by many on Thyferra. Isard's Thyferran forces comprised the Lusankya and the Star Destroyers Avarice, Virulence, and Corrupter, and as such Dlarit had access to a tremendous amount of equipment and resources. She personally led Elite Squadron, a TIE Interceptor squad that she claimed was equal to Rogue Squadron, and she trained other Defense Corps squadrons, including Might and Virile squadrons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dlarit was tasked with training Isard's starfighter forces, but she grew frustrated with their lack of commitment and discipline compared to Rogue Squadron. She also disagreed with several of Isard's decisions, which led to open and public arguments between the two. From the beginning of the Bacta War, Dlarit lobbied for her squadrons to be equipped with X-wing fighters, which she insisted were superior fighters to the TIE Interceptors\u2014but Isard, unwilling to concede that anything associated with the New Republic was superior to her resources, refused Dlarit's requests."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dlarit also sensed that the Imperial forces working with the Thyferran Home Defense Corps looked down on her and her colleagues as incompetent, idiotic, and inferior compared to the true Empire. This image was further perpetuated when Ashern commandos, working with Antilles' forces, conducted a raid on the Dlarit estate on Thyferra, stripping Aerin Dlarit naked and distributing hologram images of the humiliation with the hopes of undermining the Xucphra Corporation's regime on the planet. The raid proved to be a major source of embarrassment both for the Defense Corps and Erisi Dlarit personally. To make matters worse for Dlarit, her Imperial colleagues made no effort to hide the news from her, nor conceal their contempt about the Corps personnel from her. This fueled Dlarit's desire to seek retribution against her enemies. Despite the disrespect afforded to her by her Imperial colleagues, Dlarit's knowledge of Rogue Squadron proved to be one of her strong assets. Based on her past with them, she correctly suspected that the Rogues had established their base on the Yag-prime space station. However, Airen Cracken signed a fake report indicating that the station had been destroyed, and Dlarit, believing the report to be genuine, did not investigate or discover the base."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Bombardment of the Halanit colony"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Isard received word that a small colony on Halanit had accepted bacta from Rogue Squadron. The squadron had stolen the bacta from Isard, and the Halanit colony had insufficient resources to pay for the amount that they had received. Hoping to deter other planets and systems from accepting the squadron's help in the future, Isard dispatched Dlarit to retaliate by attacking the unarmed colony. Flying a TIE Interceptor, Dlarit led four other Interceptors from Elite Squadron to Halanit, where they provided cover for TIE Bombers as they dropped thermal detonators and proton bombs on the main colony. Once that was complete, Dlarit and the Interceptors engaged ground targets and suppressed fire as shuttles carrying stormtrooper squads headed toward the surface. Once she had destroyed all of the colony's anti-ship defenses, Dlarit flew through a large hole the bombers had created in the colony, skillfully spiraling through it into a chasm, where she opened fire on crowds of civilians and bridges. Internally, she acknowledged that the civilians were unarmed and defenseless, and that those who survived the initial onslaught would later starve or freeze to death on the icy world. Nevertheless, Dlarit harbored no feelings of guilt or compassion for them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ait Convarion, the Imperial Navy commander who had led the stormtrooper ground assault on Halanit, was impressed with Dlarit's performance and personally invited her to join him in monitoring his troopers. Dlarit felt that she had demonstrated that her pilots were worthwhile fighters, although she recognized that Convarion's invitation was partially intended to demonstrate his superiority due to the might of his troops. Shortly after she joined Convarion on the colony surface, however, a lone X-wing was launched from Halanit and began attacking the Imperial forces. Dlarit recognized from the pilot's skill that he or she had to be a member of Rogue Squadron, and she rushed back to her interceptor to engage the X-wing. However, her engine was frozen due to Halanit's cold temperatures, and by the time Dlarit was airborne, the X-wing was already escaping. She communicated with the pilot, who was quickly identified as Gavin Darklighter, and attempted to goad him into surrendering by mocking him as a coward. Darklighter did not take the bait, however, and before escaping into hyperspace, he vowed that Dlarit would die for what she had done on Halanit. He later informed Rogue Squadron of her role in the unarmed colony's destruction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not long after the bombardment of Halanit, Isard's Minister of Trade Fliry Vorru located a rendezvous point in the Alderaan system where Rogue Squadron was expected to receive a large shipment of munitions and spare parts. Vorru suggested sending Dlarit's forces to attack the Rogues, but Isard did not want to send all her ships in case the information was false. Instead, she dispatched the Corrupter and the Interdictor Cruiser Aggregator in place of Dlarit. Dlarit attempted to convince Isard to let her participate in the mission, but Isard refused. She pointed out that the starfighter squadrons aboard the Corrupter and Aggregator had received excellent evaluations, but Dlarit countered that they had never engaged in battle before, and felt that Elite Squadron would be better equipped to fight Rogue Squadron. The battle proved to be a failure for Isard, but rather than acknowledging that Dlarit's instincts had been correct, she blamed Dlarit and her training of the Corrupter and Aggregator pilots for the loss. Dlarit was furious at the accusation, and the two women argued so fiercely that Vorru feared that Isard would execute Dlarit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around this time, both Vorru and Dlarit were separately harboring concerns that Isard was insane and gradually losing control of her military campaign.

At great personal risk, Vorru defended her before Isard, sparing her from a potential execution at Isard's hands. Dlarit took notice of the intervention and, although she recognized Vorru was politically posturing, his actions won him Dlarit's favor. Vorru even began to grow sexually attracted to her. Later, in private, Vorru approached Dlarit and proposed developing contingency plans that would ensure the survival of the bacta cartel in the event of Isard's demise. Dlarit, who believed that Isard was so consumed with hatred for Wedge Antilles that she could destroy Thyferra altogether if left unchecked, agreed with Vorru's proposal."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Battle of Thyferra and death"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Avarice and its captain, Sair Yonka, defected from Isard's forces to the New Republic, Isard decided that she had to draw Antilles out by forcing him to make a hasty attack against her. To that end, she developed a plan to intern Thyferra's Vratix population and kill more than one million of them, then continue to kill two thousand a day until the species' surplus population was reduced to a small number. Despite the genocidal nature of the plan, Dlarit favored the idea, and only suggested that Isard limit the announcement of her policy to the Thyferran population, so that Antilles would not become suspicious of a trap when word eventually got back to him. Isard agreed to her suggestions and ordered Dlarit to prepare her forces to engage Rogue Squadron, either at Thyferra or at their base if its location could be discovered. Shortly after the development of her Vratix plan, Isard's spies confirmed that Rogue Squadron was based at Yag'Dhul, and she ordered the Lusankya and the Virulence to destroy the space station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the attack, however, Vorru approached Dlarit and suggested that even if Isard successfully wiped out Antilles and the Rogues, she would eventually fall from power because the New Republic would recognize the threat she posed and would commit their forces to destroying her. Vorru told Dlarit that he had generated sufficient wealth to purchase a planet and establish a profitable operation there. The Minister of Trade proposed that, after Isard destroyed Rogue Squadron, he and Dlarit travel to the Virulence on an inspection of facilities and stage an accident that would appear to result in their deaths. From there, Vorru would establish his planetary operation, and Dlarit could develop a staff of pilots to protect it.

The Rogue Squadron trap resulted in the surrender of the Virulence and the loss of Lusankya's starfighter complement. Rogue Squadron then launched an assault on Thyferra, and Dlarit scrambled her starfighters from the planet to engage them. Elite Squadron's TIE Interceptors, however, were last in the line of Thyferran Home Defense Corps ships to be launched for the attack after Virile and Might squadrons, so Dlarit was late to engage in the battle. Once she launched, Dlarit realized that Virile and Might were too spread out to properly combat Rogue Squadron. She ordered Virile Squadron to fall back and wait for Might before engaging, but Virile Lead refused, asserting that his orders came directly from Isard and insisting that they could take on Rogue Squadron themselves. As Dlarit predicted, however, both Virile and Might squadrons were easily defeated and destroyed by the Rogues.

Isard ordered Dlarit and Elite Squadron to cover Thyfonian until the ship could escape into hyperspace. Dlarit followed those orders, engaging Rogue Squadron's X-wing fighters as they protected the ship. Although most of her fellow pilots died around her, Dlarit proved to present a much better fight. She engaged Nawara Ven and, despite his attempts to evade her, successfully destroyed his X-wing and forced him to eject. Corran Horn had his R2 unit, Whistler, tap into Dlarit's communication frequencies; the two taunted each other, with Dlarit making disparaging remarks about the death of Horn's father. They engaged each other one-on-one, and Dlarit led Horn away from the rest of the battle toward Thyferra's largest moon. Horn found Dlarit a more difficult opponent than he expected due to the speed and maneuverability of her TIE Interceptor, but he believed that he could use Dlarit's arrogance against her. Horn began to inflict damage on Dlarit at a very gradual pace, but as the Thyfonian neared escape, he attempted to finish his dogfight with Dlarit by firing torpedoes at her interceptor, then accelerated his engines to catch up to her faster starfighter. Dlarit shielded herself from the torpedoes by flying low toward the moon's surface, but was distracted from Horn's subsequent attack and was shot down.

Since both Bror Jace and Corran Horn survived the attempts on their lives orchestrated by Dlarit, the New Republic considered her only Imperial success during her time as Isard's spy to be the betrayal of the bacta convoy to Warlord Zsinj at the Graveyard of Alderaan. Zsinj's subsequent destruction of that bacta convoy led to the formation of a New Republic task force led by General Han Solo to hunt down and eliminate the warlord. Since Thyferra was responsible for the production of the vast majority of the galaxy's bacta, Dlarit's support of Isard's conquest there had a tremendous impact on the distribution of bacta across the galaxy and had a major long-term effect for millions of people."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dlarit's infiltration of Rogue Squadron, coupled with raids that were later conducted against the New Republic by Zsinj, contributed to enhanced security measures on Coruscant and other New Republic strongholds. For example, at the Folor Base training facility in the Commenor system, emissions were much more contained than they were before Dlarit's defection, and external visual beacons were lit off only when landing craft needed them. For the most part, the fact that Dlarit had been able to operate in Rogue Squadron without detection did little to dampen the confidence others held in the elite squad and its leader, Wedge Antilles. However, there were a few isolated incidents of distrust or suspicion that arose from it. For instance, General Edor Crespin harbored doubts about Antilles' proposal for Wraith Squadron, a hybrid starfighter/commando unit made up largely of wash-outs and misfits.

Likewise, when she posed as a Kuati during her covert mission on Coruscant, Corran Horn felt that part of the arrogance and egotism that Dlarit feigned for the disguise was genuine.

Dlarit cared more about herself, her family, and her business interests than she did about innocent civilian lives. This was demonstrated during the attack at Halanit, where she slaughtered thousands of innocent and unarmed colonists and felt no sympathy for them\u2014rather, she justified their murders with the belief that they should have left their struggling colony long ago, and that their decision to purchase bacta from Rogue Squadron ultimately hurt the Xucphra Corporation's interests.
