But instead, a failed hyperspace jump puts Deena, Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa and Tungo Li in orbit above the Imperial refueling station, Bannistar Station. Knowing that escape is futile, and discovery is imminent, they lead a crew on a suicide mission to strike against overwhelming odds, and destroy Bannistar Station. While others are killed and captured it comes down to Deena to decide the success - or failure - of the mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Plot summary"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Issues"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}]}
