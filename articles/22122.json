Late in the Galactic Civil War, the Empire banned its production due to the netting's usefulness to the Rebels. It needed to be connected to a small power source for maximum effectiveness. The net was covered in overlapping sensor baffle scales that emulated the emissions of the surrounding terrain. It came in a small backpack and was deployable by two people in under a minute. Fully expanded, it would cover a 15 square meter area. It was once tested underwater by the mercenary Gunman, and worked just as effectively, so long as the power cell lasted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
