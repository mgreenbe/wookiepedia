The weapon fired in rapid bursts, unleashing a storm of lethal shards at opponents. The crystalline ammunition was quite small, which enabled massive ammunition capacities for sustained fire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The weapons had a different noise profile compared to other slugthrowers, producing a high-pitched hum or buzzed when it fired. While popular with local defense forces on Selonia, the weapon was rare offworld, and the crystalline ammo was next to impossible to acquire. And while shard shooters were not restricted anywhere in the galaxy, those that carried them off Selonia were often questioned and hassled about the nature of the weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
