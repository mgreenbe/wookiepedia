Whilst infiltrating a First Order bacta production plant on Tevel, Finn and Poe Dameron claimed to Major Kander Varak that as they previously examined a field hospital on the Perlemian Reach, a surgeon general questioned the orders of Supreme Leader Kylo Ren, resulting in Ren demoting her on the spot.
