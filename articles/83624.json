When the Yuuzhan Vong invaded the planet, they destroyed the planet's mechanical harvesting machines, but not the veejy crops themselves. As a result, the Pa'lowick were able to rebuild their economy after their planet was liberated. They remained unaligned politically."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
