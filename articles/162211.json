After Moren Chonk, the Chief Manager of the city Morjanssik, was murdered by a group of Imperial Intelligence saboteurs, a group of Rebel Alliance agents were blamed for the crime and were arrested in the Morjanssik Mine. Worrik was uncertain as to whether the Rebels were guilty of the crime, so he visited them and stated that he would not hand them over to the Morjanssik authorities if they could provide him with indisputable proof that they were innocent."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
