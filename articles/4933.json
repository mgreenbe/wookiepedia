While Beedo utilized the same cockpit from his MARK IV Flat-Twin Turbojet, the engines were only half the size of the normal MARK IV engines. Whereas the normal model made use of two jets, each engine on this racer had only one, thus making the engines much thinner, allowing the podracer to perform narrow courses well. The engines were also marked with the same designs, albeit more cropped due to the reduced size, that his larger RamAir racer had."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
