Like many slugthrowers the Outland propelled a metal slug at supersonic speeds through chemical explosion, and was noted for having an exceptionally long range of a kilometer and a half. These slugs were heavier than most rifles, owing to their power and range, and as a result had to be manually advanced into the chamber through bolt-action, making rapid fire difficult. Its range, combined with a retractable stock, bipod, and optional NightMight 4NS scope made it ideally suited for long range hunting and killing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because of its sturdy construction, many used the rifle as a melee weapon - pairing the rifle with a bayonet, using the rifle as a spear when hunting. Despite primarily being a sniping weapon, at least some of these rifles were modified for quick bursts of close-range fire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notable users"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Qymaen jai Sheelal wielded a Czerka Outland rifle during the Huk War on his home planet of Kalee, prior to his rebirth as General Grievous."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
