During the Clone Wars, it was utilized by the Confederacy of Independent Systems to transmit Shadowfeeds, Separatist propaganda transmissions, to enemy worlds along the Perlemian Trade Route. It was destroyed by forces led by Captain Wilhuff Tarkin during the Battle of Murkhana in the first year of the war, rendering the planet without HoloNet communications.
