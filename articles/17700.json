Vansk did not often use the blade in combat, preferring instead to use her red-bladed lightsaber, but she carried the blade as a secondary weapon. The blade was taken from Vansk after her death in 1 ABY at the hands of spacers during the Blackguard Purge, in which a Sullustan archaeologist named Mi Fon Lu hired a group of spacers to kill all the Blackguard in the Southern Jedi Ruins on the planet Mustafar, as he wished to research in the area."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Blade of the Betrayer first appeared in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies as part of the Trials of Obi-Wan expansion released in 2005.
