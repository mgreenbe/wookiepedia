Shortly after the secret mission to Tatooine, Qui-Gon appears before his former apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi, who now goes by \"Ben.\" Qui-Gon senses that Ben fears for the safety of Luke Skywalker, who has gone to find his uncle Owen Lars and aunt Beru at their farm. Ben thinks there will be stormtroopers there, but Qui-Gon tells Kenobi to rescue him or he may rescue himself. Qui-Gon adds that the sister may find the brother instead. Kenobi fears that Skywalker will be killed. Qui-Gon reassures Kenobi that Luke has yet to embark on a great journey and that it does not end here."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When asked, Qui-Gon acknowledges that he has seen it. Through the Force, Qui-Gon senses the deaths of a dozen Jawas, who are being tended to by C-3PO and R2-D2. Kenobi explains that Senator Bail Organa sent Leia herself to summon him and that she reminds him of her late mother, Padm\u00e9 Amidala. Kenobi confides that he has waited for this day for a long time. When Qui-Gon asks if he thinks that his work has only begun, Obi-Wan looks back on his life and says that he has been little more than a shadow waiting to become a Jedi Knight again. Qui-Gon counsels Kenobi that battles and wars are not a measure of a Jedi but rather patience and fortitude, which is something that Kenobi has achieved where so few have succeeded."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi blames himself for having failed every person he truly loved\u2014Anakin Skywalker, Satine Kryze, Padm\u00e9, and Qui-Gon himself. Qui-Gon reassures him that the responsibility for failure lies with himself and not Kenobi. When Qui-Gon tells Kenobi that he was not yet ready to take on the apprenticeship of Skywalker, Kenobi interjects that Anakin became a Jedi Knight and had served valiantly during the Clone Wars. While acknowledging his responsibility in Anakin's fall, Kenobi counters that Anakin had the training and wisdom to choose a better path. While the droids burn the Jawas' bodies, Kenobi confides that he did not tell Luke the whole truth about Anakin. Qui-Gon reassures him that he has only become acquainted with the boy and to tell him the whole truth would have planted the seeds of doubt, confusion, and anger, leading him down Vader's path."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Qui-Gon counsels that the best time to tell Luke would be when he is ready, stable, and strong with the Force. When Kenobi remarks that Qui-Gon is nearly corporeal, Qui-Gon responds that it is a matter of learning to both claim the physical world and to detach oneself from it. He adds that it is a matter of finding center, of calming one's soul and giving oneself completely over to the Force, and that some Jedi choose to transition between life and death in that way. Kenobi says that he looks forward to mastering this skill from Qui-Gon. Obi-Wan thanks Qui-Gon for his wisdom and promises to meet again. Qui-Gon allows his consciousness to spread outward from this place, and disappear back to the elements."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
