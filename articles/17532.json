It was a small base in a remote mountain region of the moon. Most of the base was built underground, with only a small building visible from above. Its purpose remains unknown. 1.5 years after the Battle of Yavin, an Imperial agent investigating the whereabouts of the rogue Imperial Star Destroyer Blackguard found out that Grand Admiral Sait tried to sell the ship to the Black Sun. Upon learning this, Major Appleton sent him to the stronghold to find information about the ship's location. The agent infiltrated the base and killed several well armed Black Sun members until he found a datapad with the sought-after coordinates."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This base was part of the short series of quests that player's of Star Wars Galaxies were required to do before they were allowed to enter the Star Destroyer Heroic Encounter aboard the Blackguard.
