Among the available models were agrirobots that planted, sprayed, harvested, and packaged such edibles as fruit, vegetables, and grain. The Myrkr SS-23, for example, sprayed various types of animal sewage fertilizer. Some models, such as Cybot Galactica's BigScoop Robo-Harvester, could perform almost all these tasks. Other Agribots included the 5T Tree Feeder, CD-2 Harvesters and the HD-234-C."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
