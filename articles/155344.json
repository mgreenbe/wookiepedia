Towards the end of the war, the Venator-class Star Destroyer became engaged in a battle against a dreadnought of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, with both vessels sustaining severe damage. After falling out of hyperspace, the Star Destroyer crashed onto the planet Zeffo. Chiata and her Padawan, Marseph, both survived, though were separated. Shortly after the crash, Order 66 was executed, and the clone troopers aboard the wrecked ship turned on the Jedi. Chiata was killed, as was her Clone Commander, and Marseph died from his wounds some time afterward. Several years later, the wreckage was discovered by the former Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
