In 7811 BBY, the Republic established first contact with warships associated with the Waymancy Hollow. The encounter, which proved to be disastrous for Republic naval forces, led to the conflict known as the Waymancy Storm, waged between the Republic and the Signatories of Waymancy in several star systems in the Northern Dependencies portion of the Inner Rim and the Expansion Region.
