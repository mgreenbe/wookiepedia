The city was known as Corellia's finest mountain resort city. Like many other tourist destinations, Doaba Guerfel strived to remain a placid, safe escape from the rest of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the city's proximity to pristine forests and wilderness, the citizens of Doaba Guerfel were active environmentalists. The town spent millions of credits each year on preservation and restoration projects in the hopes of protecting Corellia's native flora and fauna, but perhaps more significant was Doaba Guerfel's reputation for wild revelry. Nights in Doaba Guerfel were filled with sounds of music and celebration, and the town annually consumed more Corellian ale than all of the neighboring cities combined."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The site was originally a private resort, complete with a hunting lodge, small hotel, and raucous cantina. The limited membership included Corellia's wealthiest families, as well as many powerful Republic senators. The resort, which was simply known as Nomad's Retreat, eventually fell under sharp criticism for it elitism. Over the course of several decades, Nomad's Retreat gradually expanded its membership and eventually became a public resort about four hundred years before the start of the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For nearly a century, Nomad's Retreat was a seasonal resort town, with attendance ebbing and flowing as weather changed. To provide staff with semi-permanent homes, the proprietors and investors of the retreat funded construction of a village only a few kilometers from the resort. The village, which took on the name Doaba Guerfel, was populated for only about half of each standard year with a variety of resort staff, ranging from cooks and cleaning crew to hunting guides and airspeeder pilots. During the next three hundred years, Doaba Guerfel continued to grow, eventually merging with the original resort and Nomad's Retreat no longer existed as an independent entity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, the city was far removed from galactic politics and had rigorously resisted both Imperial and Rebel incursions. After the Battle of Yavin, the criminal organization known as the Chirq Council was very active in Doaba Guerfel. Around 1 ABY, the city hosted a large Life Day celebration."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The following individuals were residents or visitors of the city in the time after the Battle of Yavin: Coraline Dynes, Corran Horn, Jadam Questrel, Scolex Grath, Zakarisz Ghent, Willham Burke, Talte, Vitala Baize, Lilith Laughlin, Dayana, Gwhirrye Baric, Xyrias Undea, Trins Evnar, Seyda Shae, Genovin Jasha, Jade McDonagh, Kazic Pendre, and Strilath Farles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Doaba Guerfel appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From December 16, 2008 to January 12, 2009, Doaba Guerfel was one of three cities chosen to be the hosts of the live Wookiee Life Day event. During the event, the entire city and its surroundings were covered with white snow as a constant snowfall occurred. After many players asked to keep the snow in Doaba Guerfel after the end of the regular Life Day events, the developers decided to make the weather change permanent. Doaba Guerfel also continued being the host of festivities during subsequent Life Day events."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
