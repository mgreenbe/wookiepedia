The lightsaber was kept in close to the body, with the hilt covering the navel. With the tip of the blade angled so that attacks could be picked up on its lower third, then to be shunted aside, and a riposte against an enemy's stomach or chest was possible. This was the last line of defense and was considered dangerous to both defend and attack from."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There are parallels between the three rings and the three styles introduced in Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast and elaborated in Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy.

Finally, the middle ring is suitable for combat in the medium style."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The three rings of defense were similar to the principle of Shii-Cho, one of the seven classic lightsaber styles of the Old Jedi Order, because of its simplicity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
