Devaronian supporters of the anti-Imperial rebellion were hunted by the Devaronian Army, led by Kardue'sai'Malloc, in the northlands of the planet. They were eventually besieged in the city of Montellian Serat and bombarded until they surrendered. After the battle, the Devaronian Army was ordered to reinforce Imperial troops in another battle but the Devaronians were unable to take care of any prisoners. Kardue'sai'Malloc eventually gave the order to execute the seven hundred captured Rebel supporters, including men, women, and children. The city of Montellian Serat was also destroyed to prevent any other city to shelter Rebels. It took almost six months for the Rebellion on Devaron to be put down. The slaughter of Montellian Serat gave Kardue'sai'Malloc the nickname \"Butcher of Montellian Serat\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
