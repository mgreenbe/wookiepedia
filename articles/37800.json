It was largely dominated by Ithorians, and maintained a populace of roughly 15,000. The Ithorians on Auratera had long dedicated their lives to restoring the city to its natural state following the end of the Sith Wars. However, while the final war ended around 1,000 years before the Republic Era, there were still ruins to clear, as well as dangerous chemicals and agents to neutralize."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to keep with Ithorian tradition, Dewbright was located above the surface of the world on elevated platforms. It was tucked into a large cove on the eastern coast of the large inland Crystal Sea. The Ithorians made use of boats and skimmers to travel the sea and its rivers to reach restoration sites across the region. The city was located in the planet's southern hemisphere, on the opposite side of the world from the Acablas Ruins."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dewbright was mentioned in Nexus of Power, a 2016 sourcebook for Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars: Force and Destiny roleplaying game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
