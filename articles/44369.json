They saw action during the liberation of Kashyyyk in 4 ABY. Utilizing powerful short-range lasers, pummels were used to ground down enemy defensive fortifications, including walls, antipersonnel turrets, and ground-based deflector shields, allowing infantry and lighter units to breach enemy defenses. Though heavily armored, pummels were also very slow and vulnerable. To compensate for this, pummels were sent into battle heavily escorted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wookiee pummels and Heavy Wookiee pummels appear in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds.
