The fastener was activated by a molecularly coded key which 'read' the lock. A molecular chain was formed between the key and the lock, and was broken as the key was removed, activating the lock. The lock could be opened only when the the key was reinserted, reuniting the bisected halves of the molecular chain. They were sold at Rordan's Spaceship Parts and More in Verena City on the planet Kirima."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
