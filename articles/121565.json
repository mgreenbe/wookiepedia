A sizable Jedi force was detailed for landing in and reoccupying the walled city circa 3960 BBY, but the vast bulk of Revan's troops were simultaneously committed to digging out the entrenched Mandalorian holdouts on the jungle moon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fighting intensified throughout the battle, as the Mandalorian troops were fractured and made many fighting retreats, trying to kill as many Jedi and Republic troops as possible."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mandalorian devastation would ingrain itself in the minds of the Onderonian people for years to come, creating a latent hostility against not only against their former oppressors, but also against the Republic itself: specifically, that by belonging to the Republic, they invited more misery upon themselves than by reverting to their old xenophobic isolationism.
