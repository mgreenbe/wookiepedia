In 22 BBY, Mack was assigned to fly Senator Kharrus, Gungan Representative Jar Jar Binks and several Coruscant Guards to the planet Florrum in order to deliver a ransom in the form of spice to a group of pirates who had captured the Sith Lord Count Dooku. Unknown to the Republic, Turk Falso, the second man in the pirate gang, cooperated with fellow pirate Barb Mentir to betray the group's leader, Hondo Ohnaka, and steal the spice. Upon arriving in the atmosphere of Florrum, the Republic shuttle was ambushed by Mentir in a Flarestar-class Weequay ship. Mentir attacked the shuttle with his laser cannons and with two rockets. Due to interference by Binks, who accidentally removed Mack from his seat in the cockpit, the rockets hit the ship, sending it crashing into the Doshar fields on Florrum. The impact killed Mack, his partner pilot and Kharrus, but the rest of the team survived."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clone trooper pilot nicknamed Mack was one of the many clones of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett, which were born on the Wild Space planet Kamino to fight for the Galactic Republic.
