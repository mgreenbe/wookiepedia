Its agents, recognizable by their distinctive blue uniforms, were commonly referred to as judicials, because the Office of Criminal Investigations was itself a branch of the Republic's Judicial Department. The Security Force's missions were to investigate corporate and government entities as well as combat pirates and criminal organizations. For that purpose, the Force maintained a large fleet of starships they used to support local patrols, conduct investigations in remote places, and carry out counterpiracy operations. The judicials frequently worked alongside members of the Jedi Order, and although some resented the Jedi's privileged standing, most trusted in their judgment and treated them with professional civility. Nevertheless, friction could still occur between the two groups, because the judicials aimed to collect evidence for courtroom jutsice, while the Jedi would sometimes issue their own rulings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
