Annihilator 1 was used in the Massacre on Abridon as part of Tulon's task force. Tulon, in an attempt to defect to the Rebel Alliance, turned it against the rest of his force and headed Annihilator 1 towards the Rebel base, but the walker was brought down by the forces of General Brenn Tantor, Tulon's old student. Tantor was shocked to discover that Tulon, pulled out of the wreckage, was the defector and not a subordinate but nevertheless did his duty and had Tulon taken into custody and sent to Tarkin Detention Facility on Ruul."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
