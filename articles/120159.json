The Sarapin Wanderer was traveling with several other Republic vessels when it was attacked by the Imperial Navy, and the vessel's captain was killed. However, the Jedi Master Oteg was aboard the Wanderer and he took command of the vessel, organizing a counterattack that drove the Imperial attackers into a nearby nebula. When the Imperials attempted to return fire, they were destroyed when their own weapons detonated the gases of the nebula."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sarapin Wanderer was first mentioned in Oteg's bio entry in the 2012 reference guide Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
