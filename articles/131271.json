Unbeknownst to him, his personal physician had been suborned by Carnor Jax, backed by a number of other high-ranking Imperial personnel.

Shortly after, Luke Skywalker arrived with his fellow Jedi. Following their arrival, Rayf Ysanna was then killed by a barrage of Sith lightning, and Empatojayos Brand was mortally wounded. Skywalker, stunned that Palpatine was going for baby Anakin Solo, looked on in shock, before Sidious was then shot by a blaster bolt sent from Han Solo (which he purposely didn't block) and proceed to sadistically rush his cackling spirit towards the infant Anakin Solo, however, he was intercepted by the body of the dying Brand, who chose to make the ultimate sacrifice as he died, willingly clasping his soul to Palpatine's, ensuring that both of them would be pulled into the netherworld of the Force (In Palpatine's case, Chaos). At long last, and with the assistance of all the Jedi of the past dragging him down, Emperor Palpatine was finally and truly killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Issues"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
