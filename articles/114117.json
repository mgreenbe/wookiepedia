The RDS reported directly to the Office of the Supreme Chancellor and was notably separate from the Coruscant Security Force. The agency was charged with handling all breaches in security by civil servants. At their headquarters, the RDS conducted interrogations and held prisoners unless they were transferred to Republic Intelligence for further questioning. In 19 BBY, Republic Treasury Audit Division Agent Jilka Zan Zentis was arrested by the RDS for illegally copying and removing data from Treasury computers. However, the information was planted, and Zentis was later freed by members of the Skirata Clan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Republic Domestic Security (RDS) was a Galactic Republic domestic law enforcement agency that operated toward the end of the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems.

However, the evidence against Zentis had been planted to divert attention from Agent Besany Wennen, who was gathering information for Grand Army of the Republic Sergeant Kal Skirata. Skirata and his clan had been tracking information on Palpatine's clone trooper deployments and were securing funds to flee the Republic. When Wennen told them that Zentis had been arrested, they made plans to free her. Posing as a Republic Intelligence officer, ARC Captain Ordo arranged for Wennen to be transferred to Republic Intelligence custody. When the prison transport speeder left the RDS facility, Sergeants Wad'e Tay'haai and Walon Vau, along with Ordo, ambushed the transport midair, forcing it to land, and freed Zentis from the RDS agents. With the formation of the Galactic Empire, the duties of the RDS were given to the Imperial Security Bureau."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Republic Domestic Security first appeared in Order 66: A Republic Commando Novel, written by Karen Traviss and published on May 19, 2009.
