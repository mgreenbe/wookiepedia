The next year, Louise did puppeteer work for Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi. She auditioned for the film without knowing what it was, due to the high levels of security involved. Neal Scanlan was at the audition, and Louise became excited, then realizing it was a Star Wars film. After a costume fitting and plaster cast for her costume, Louise was cast as an orange-skinned alien, which appeared on Canto Bight. Louise was thrilled to have gotten the part, having been a longtime Star Wars fan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2018, she played the role of Margo in Solo: A Star Wars Story.
