The primary recurring villains are Morag the Tulgah Witch and the Ewoks' rival species the Duloks. Produced byNelvana on behalf of Lucasfilm Ltd., Ewoks was broadcast on ABC from 1985 to 1986. The first season was advertised as simply Ewoks, and was aired as part of the Ewoks and Droids Adventure Hour, whereas the second season was advertised as The All New Ewoks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Development"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars creator George Lucas had long been interested in animation, and had wanted to tell Star Wars stories in an animated form. During production of The Star Wars Holiday Special in 1978, director David Acomba showed Lucas a recent film made by Canada-based animation company Nelvana. This convinced Lucas to hire the company to produce the animated segment for that film. Lucas was pleased with their work, and in 1984, he again hired them to work on the two animated series he was developing, Droids and Ewoks. These two subjects were chosen because they would appeal to young audiences and because, as the future of the film franchise was uncertain, they would be the least likely characters to conflict with the stories of the feature films. With these two shows, Lucas (who served as executive producer) hoped to raise the standards for Saturday morning animation; he wanted the animation and voice acting to be better than the average animated series of the time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pre-production began in May of 1984. During this time, Lucas met with the show's producers, directors and writers, who all collaborated on story ideas. Lucas laid out his basic ideas for the series, but wasn't involved with day-to-day matters. He wanted the Ewoks' culture to be based on themes universal to Earth mythology and religion, and suggested the crew read The Hero with a Thousand Faces and The Uses of Enchantment. Writer Paul Dini later reflected on these sessions: \"In my first meeting with George, one of the things we kept coming back to was that the Ewoks would have a sense of community and continuity.\" Though the main characters from the saga films were off-limits, the writers were given almost complete creative freedom to develop the Ewoks beyond Return of the Jedi. The crew reimagined the Ewok characters for the animated format, giving each Ewok a unique, distinguishable personality and distinctive features. The stories were often inspired by The Lord of the Rings, Pogo and the Uncle Scrooge stories."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For visual reference, Lucasfilm had the crew travel to Muir Woods National Monument, a location near Skywalker Ranch where the Endor scenes were filmed for Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. Writer Bob Carrau recalled the experience: \"What was really great for me about Ewoks, was that you could walk around in nature (like when you were camping or something) and you would come across a pine cone that looked really neat. What [sic] was great, because you could go back to the writing table and write a story about it!\" Clive Smith estimated that each hour-long pair of Droids and Ewoks episodes cost approximately $500,000 to $600,000 to produce, making them amongst the more expensive animated series for that time. He later commented on the production: \"Ewoks wasn't as problematic because you could get away with more animal characters. Droids had many recognizable humanoid characters which are much harder to do and make look right\". Layout artist Brian Lemay had a different take: \"The Droids show was much more challenging as it had far more locations and they required perspective drawing which I really enjoy (a lot more than drawing trees, that's for sure). [\u2026] The main difference was the lack of trees in Droids. [\u2026] I guess the other key difference was the lack of emotion in the characters in the Droids series. They always seemed to have the same emotion on their faces where as with the Ewoks they had lots of emotion, happy, sad, surprised, angry, the whole range.\" During production, the American animation team would often play games during down time, and would regularly play practical jokes on each other. Wang Film Productions contributed some of the animation for this series."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the second season, Lucasfilm moved a majority of the production to their own studios, and thus exherted more direct control over producing the series than Nelvana. Production started on season two in late 1985. The new executive producers, Cliff Ruby and Elana Lesser, suggested making a few changes to the series. Most of the new episodes were shorter in length, and now focused on the core characters of Wicket, Tebbo, Kneesaa and Latara, with the other characters either playing lesser roles or written out entirely. Changes were made to better distinguish the Ewoks from one another and to make them more distinctive. Other changes included different voice actors, new music and a new opening which utilized CGI. Denny Delk (who voiced Wicket in the second season) commented on the actors' recording schedule: \"We usually completed a story in about an hour and a half, unless there was something especially tricky. We'd do two or three stories in a day, and record every week or so.\" According to Jim Henshaw (who voiced Wicket in the first season), the cast had access to a list of Ewokese words and phrases that they would consult to invigorate their dialogue; \"When there were long speeches of exposition, to get a story rolling or something, we'd stick in a few more choice phrases \u2013 and all of a sudden, we would sound like we really did come from another planet!\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the episodes were being worked on, rough cuts were screened for Lucas. The first season's musical score was created by Patricia Cullen, David Greene and David Shaw, with an opening song by Taj Mahal and Inshira Mahal. The second season's music was composed by Patrick Gleeson, and had a different opening song in which the Ewoks sing about friendship. The series was under strict broadcast standards, and there were limitations\u2014set by ABC's Standards and Practices Board\u2014as to what could be shown or dealt with in the episodes. Dini commented on this in a 2004 interview: \"...we were dealing with a regime at the network that just wanted safe children's programming. Every time we wanted to stretch it a little bit, they would kick up a fuss over it\"; ABC rejected an episode Dini had written called \"The Starman\" because it was \"too Star Warsy\". At one point, Lucasfilm considered making an animated Ewoks special in the vein of The Great Heep, but opted instead to make Ewoks: The Battle for Endor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Release"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ewoks debuted on September 7, 1985, and ran against Muppet Babies and The Smurfs. Despite frequent schedule changes and generally low ratings, the series was renewed for a second season in late 1985. However, ratings did not improve and the series was canceled in 1986. Writer/producer Paul Dini speculated that, had the series been renewed for a third season, it would have featured more stories about Malani, Asha and the woklings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the mid 1990s, beginning in 1994, the US Sci-Fi Channel ran episodes of the series, along with those of its counterpart, Droids, on its \"Cartoon Quest\" and \"Animation Station\" blocks of programming."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Merchandising"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1984, Joe Johnston wrote and illustrated The Adventures of Teebo: A Tale of Magic and Suspense, an Ewok storybook that introduced many of the elements that would later appear in the series. Also that year, Random House began publishing a series of children's books with the subtitle \"An Ewok Adventure,\" which were meant to tie into both the series and Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure. In 1985, Kenner produced a toy line based on the series, including action figures, ship models, and other items. Also that year, Star Comics, an imprint of Marvel Comics, published a bimonthly Ewoks comic, which was based on the animated series. The comic ran for two years, ending with issue #14. Like the TV series, this was aimed towards a younger audience. It was produced along with the Droids comic, which was based on the Droids animated series. Star Comics' Ewoks 10 was a crossover with Droids 4. An LP record and a cassette were released of the French theme song by Doroth\u00e9e."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the series finished production, Nelvana sent the majority of pre-production materials to Lucasfilm, who later partnered with the former company Royal Animated Art to sell these materials to private owners. Some were bought by a California business, and some were later given out as part of the Hyperspace fan club. In 2010, StarWars.com celebrated the 25th anniversary of both Droids and Ewoks by featuring a series of articles about the collectibles available from each series. The 2013 one-shot comic Star Wars: Ewoks\u2014Shadows of Endor was designed to tie together all the various aspects of Ewok lore."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Home video"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The series received its first home video release in 1990 when J2 Communications released The Star Wars Trilogy Animated Collection.

Each tape began with a Star Wars Animated Classics trailer promoting the \"Special Double Length Edition\" volumes. However, for the single volume tapes, the white box covers were shown, but differing content was advertised. CBS/Fox Video also released the complete series on Region 2 VHS in the UK."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On June 26, 2002, prequel trilogy producer Rick McCallum responded to a question about a complete DVD release on StarWars.com's now-defunct \"Ask the Jedi Council\" feature, in which he said \"I hope so. Definitely. At some point after we're finished with Episode III, we'd really like to make all of that material available to our fans on DVD. Unfortunately, we won't be even thinking of making any firm plans until we're finished with this trilogy.\" He also expressed this privately to Paul Ens. According to Pablo Hidalgo, a full series release was considered as an alternative to the Animated Adventures DVDs: \"I don't know what numbers are run in the mysterious background that decides to say 'You know what? That doesn't look like a product that we can move.'\" At 2005's Celebration III, McCallum and Lucasfilm's Vice President of marketing Jim Ward dodged questions about a complete DVD release of the series.
