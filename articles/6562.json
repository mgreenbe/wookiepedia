He flew his Eta-2 in numerous battles during the closing days of the Clone Wars, proving time and again his superiority as a pilot. Often at his side was his former Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, in a gray and maroon-colored Eta-2 interceptor. Although he was impressed with Anakin's skill, Obi-Wan often remarked on Anakin's reckless piloting. Obi-Wan and other Jedi were also concerned about Anakin's obsession and possessive attitude toward the ships he had for personal use. Saesee Tiin, however, often encouraged the young Jedi Knight to continue making modifications and enhancements to his ships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 20 BBY, he used this fighter on Cato Neimoidia after the Separatists launched an attack on the planet.
