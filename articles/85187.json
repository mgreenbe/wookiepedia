In 1 BBY, he was caught in a crossfire between the Thig Brothers and Jodo Kast. Mageye was dropped by the Weequays who'd been carrying him and rolled on top of bounty hunter Zardra, prompting her to stick a thermal detonator in his mouth rather than be suffocated. Mageye's death prompted Jabba to place a 50,000 credit bounty on Zardra's head, which was soon picked up by Gorm the Dissolver."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
