They were used in Republic bota transport ships where they housed with superconductor couplings. When one of the transports exploded over Republic Mobile Surgical Unit 7 on the planet Drongar during the Battle of Drongar a clone trooper lieutenant theorised it may have been due to the superconductor couplings slipping and causing the ship to go critical.
