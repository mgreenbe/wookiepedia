While in the wastes, several of their colleagues inexplicable came under the influence of the dark side of the Force and attacked Master Kirlocca. Rushing to defend the Councilor, Padawans Hary'nkel and Misha Quor-Din as well as Master Vols and another Jedi were rebuffed as they tried to fend off their deranged peers. Overcome and outnumbered, Master Vols sacrificed himself in an effort to allow Hary'nkel, Quor-Din and the other Jedi to escape over the nearby cliff. Leaping from the cliff, Hary'nkel broke his leg in the fall from the cliff and placed himself into a healing trance. He was discovered shortly afterward by the Heroes of Cularin and he explained to them what had happened."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
