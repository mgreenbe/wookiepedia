They were used in the city of Redhaven on Rhommamool by the Red Knights of Life, the fanatic followers of \"Rhommamoolian tyrant\" Nom Anor, who was secretly a Yuuzhan Vong agent and executor sent to sow discord in the New Republic. The Red Knights would accost any individuals in the city using mechanical means of transport such as landspeeders and insist that they ride tutakans instead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
