After the war's end, B1-268 resided in the wreckage of a downed Separatist supply ship on the planet Agamar, along with super tactical droid general Kalani and many other battle droids. During the Galactic Civil War, B1-268 and several B1-series battle droids apprehended members of the Phoenix Cell, who had come to Agamar in search of munitions. Giving them no other option, Kalani forced the rebels to engage the droids in the \"last battle\" of the Clone Wars. Once the battle came to an end, the Galactic Empire arrived on the planet after tracing a rebel transmission there, and B1-268 was sent to discover why the Empire had come. Upon encountering the Imperial stormtroopers, however, he was destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Construction and Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "B1-268 was an OOM command battle droid manufactured by Baktoid Combat Automata and Baktoid Armor Workshop to serve the Separatist Droid Army during the Clone Wars, an intergalactic conflict which pitted the Confederacy of Independent Systems against the Galactic Republic. The Confederacy wished to secede from the Republic, believing it to be a corrupt institution, and waged war throughout the galaxy against the Republic, battling against their army of clone soldiers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Near the war's end, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine of the Republic\u2014who was, in truth, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, secret leader of the Separatists\u2014issued Clone Protocol 66, which branded the Force-wielding Jedi of the Republic as traitors and resulted in the destruction of the Jedi Order. Sidious gave a speech to the Galactic Senate, proclaiming the Jedi were traitors and declaring that the Republic would be transformed into the First Galactic Empire. Whilst Sidious gave his speech, his new apprentice, Darth Vader, slaughtered the remaining Separatist leaders in their compound on the planet Mustafar. Vader contacted Sidious, who instructed him to send a transmission ordering that all remaining battle droids be deactivated. Kalani, a super tactical droid who served as a general in the Droid Army and was B1-268's commander, received the message on the Outer Rim world of Agamar. However, Kalani assumed it was a trick by the Republic, so he did not shut down his forces."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rebels on Agamar"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Clone War over and the Separatist Alliance dissolved, B1-268 and his fellow droids resided in the remains of a downed Separatist supply ship on Agamar. In the year 2 BBY, seventeen years after the war's end, members of a rebel movement against the Empire entered the supply ship in search of munitions. After locating the ship's munitions depot, the rebels were caught in a ray shield and quickly surrounded by B1-268 and five B1 battle droids. B1-268, believing the intruders were a part of the Galactic Republic, instructed his troops to prepare to shoot them; however, he received new orders saying that the invaders were to instead be brought to the ship's command center. B1-268 commented on how it was his first time capturing enemies, so he and his droids stunned them before dragging the prisoners back to the center."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After bringing the rebels to the command center, B1-268 reported in with General Kalani, who congratulated the droid on accomplishing his task. Kalani spoke with the prisoners, two of whom were Jedi, one of whom was a Captain, and one of whom was a Lasat guardsman. Kalani, wishing to end the Clone Wars once and for all with a Separatist victory, proposed that one last battle take place in which his forces hold the Lasat hostage while the Jedi and clone battled his droids to rescue him. Facing the threat of termination if they did not comply, they accepted the tactical droid's terms and left the ship while Kalani's forces moved into position. After defeating the first wave of droids and making their way to the hangar, the rebels were caught off guard by droidekas from the catwalk above and forced to take cover. While the rebels devised a plan to defeat the droids, B1-268 moved in on their position along with several B1 battle droids. The rebels managed to initiate their plan, however: one of the Jedi, Ezra Bridger, used the Force to ram a crane into the catwalk, causing the droidekas to fall down onto B1-268's forces below. B1-268 managed to avoid being crushed, however, and the rebels passed by him as they continued making their way to the command center."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rebels secured the command center, thus ending the battle. However, the Empire had intercepted a distress signal transmitted by a rebel astromech droid that had evaded capture by the battle droids, C1-10P, and had responded by sending soldiers to Agamar. Kalani ordered B1-268 to investigate, and the droid approached the incoming shuttles along with three other battle droids. B1-268 greeted the stormtroopers, informing them that he was sent to ascertain what the Empire was doing on the planet. His words went ignored, as Imperial protocol dictated that any \"clankers\" (battle droids) were to be shot on sight. When the troopers shot B1-268's accompanying droids, he attempted to flee, but was crushed by an AT-AT walker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "B1-268 showed great loyalty to the Separatist cause, informing the rebels he and his droids caught that they were in Separatist custody, despite it being over a decade after the Confederacy's dissolution. Quick to follow orders, B1-268 did not hesitate to alter his objective from killing the intruders on Agamar to stunning and capturing them, nor did he back down from hazardous situations, marching head-on with his fellow droids at the rebels in the supply ship's hangar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like B1 and other OOM command battle droids, B1-268 stood at 1.93 meters tall and was created for the purpose of engaging in combat. B1-268 sported several yellow markings, indicating him as a command droid. Unlike most standard and command battle droids, however, B1-268 lacked a comlink booster pack. B1-268 was armed with an E-5 blaster rifle, the standard weapon of most battle droids, and would stow it on his backside when not using it. Due to not receiving any maintenance after the Clone War's conclusion, various scratches and scorch marks could be seen on B1-268's plating."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "B1-268 appeared in the sixth episode of the animated television series Star Wars Rebels' third season, \"The Last Battle,\" which aired on October 22, 2016, on Disney XD. B1-268 was voiced by Matthew Wood, who voiced the battle droids in Lucasfilm Animation's previous television series, Star Wars: The Clone Wars. The battle droid was named by Steven Melching, who is credited as story editor in \"The Last Battle,\" after his birthday."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the original outline for \"The Last Battle,\" Ezra Bridger would've befriended B1-268 and nicknamed him \"Roger,\" though this idea was dismissed as the animated series LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures features a B1 battle droid named Roger. B1-268's nickname was then changed to \"Clanky,\" however the idea of Bridger nicknaming the droid was cut from the episode early in production. The Star Wars Rebels staff considered having B1-268 become a member of the Ghost crew, but this was decided against due to them believing there were already too many crew members and there wasn't enough room for another."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
