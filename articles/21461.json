They absorbed the heat from the star Yavin and converted it into nourishment. They could also use the absorbed heat as a defense mechanism, radiating the collected energy into heat waves that could scald anyone within range. Multiple burning snakes working together would throw off massive waves of super hot energy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
