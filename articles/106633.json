These aliens came to be known as Polis Massans themselves, and established a small yet efficient civilization on the arid asteroid. One of the major facilities on Polis Massa was the medical center, used for surgical and research purposes. Artifacts retrieved from the dig sites were brought to the medical facility for examination by Polis Massan exobiologists, who scanned the pieces for organic tissue suitable for cloning. Having learned the secrets of cloning from the natives of Kamino, the Polis Massans were experts in the field, and were renowned for their medical expertise."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The medical facility comprised a series of squat, white buildings and domes, with the main medical center rising slightly higher from the rear of the facility. A landing pad was connected to the facility, allowing those few visitors who traveled to Polis Massa easy access to the medcenter. An observation dome overlooked the compound."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Within the antiseptic interior of the Polis Massa medical facility lay a fully-equipped surgical theater. This operating room was supervised by several Polis Massan exobiologists and medtechs, while a GH-7 medical and midwife droids performed surgery and delivered babies. Wall displays and scanners adorned the chamber, while a transparisteel partition separated the theater from onlookers outside. A single, cushioned operating table stood in the middle of the theater room."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Padm\u00e9 Amidala was brought to the Polis Massa medical facility by Obi-Wan Kenobi following the formation of the Galactic Empire. In a critical condition, and with the birth of her twins imminent, Padm\u00e9 was tended to by four Polis Massan medtechs and their surgical droids. A midwife droid assisted with Padm\u00e9's labor, but the medics were unable to save Amidala. Though the twins were born and adopted by loving families, Padm\u00e9 died in the operating theater\u2014not due to her injuries, but because, perhaps, a broken heart can never truly be mended."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the rise of the Empire, the facility was home to a Rebel cell which Imperial Intelligence believed the Death Star plans were transmitted to.
