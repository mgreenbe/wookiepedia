This fact was discovered by Sullustan gambler Cunbus Locb, who since coveted \"Stars and Moons.\" Locb prepared a convoluted scheme to con Ammar and get \"Stars and Moons.\" In case his idea failed, Locb also manufactured a forgery of \"Stars and Moons\", intending to swap the two pieces; he hid the fake in a concealed compartment of his ship, Distant Wind."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Locb successfully played sabacc with Ammar, cheated and won \"Stars and Moons\" in a high-stake hand.

Correctly deducing that \"Stars and Moons\" would be in the Distant Wind, Ammar ordered the ship impounded and scrutinized, but neither the original or the copy were found. Ammar eventually sent the Wind to a public auction and offered a big reward for \"Stars and Moons.\" Most art dealers in the area thus were familiar with \"Stars and Moons\" being a stolen flatsculp."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
