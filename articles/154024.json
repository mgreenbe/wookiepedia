In 1 BBY, Jedi General Rahm Kota, who had been captured after a failed raid on the planet, was forced to fight in the arena. After watching Kota defeat another executioner, Tarko ordered the aide to release slice hounds into the arena."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Starkiller, a clone of the late Galen Marek, entered the arena to relieve an exhausted Kota, the Neimoidian was ordered by an enraged Tarko to release a massive creature called the Gorog into the arena, ignoring his aide's misgivings over their ability to control the beast.
