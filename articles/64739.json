He flew an A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter for the Alliance to Restore the Republic's Starfighter Corps. His ability to operate within the fighter's rotatable cockpit was heightened due to his inherent kinesthetic sense. He wore a green flight suit and helmet while in his B-wing, and he had orange eyes as well as brown-mottle-colored skin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ika Sulko was created for a scene in the 1983 original trilogy film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi that was ultimately deleted. He was first pictured in the new Star Wars canon in  issue 67 of De Agostini's Star Wars Helmet Collection magazine, published in 2018. He was then identified in the 2019 reference book Rebel Starfighters Owners' Workshop Manual, written by Ryder Windham. In the Star Wars Legends continuity, Sulko was first mentioned outside of his deleted scene in his 2012 Hasbro action figure, released as part of the Star Wars: The Vintage Collection line."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Footage of the scene was first revealed in a trailer for the Star Wars: The Complete Saga box set at Comic-Con International in 2011. In the scene, Sulko says several lines as they are given to a puppeteer referred to as Tim, confirmed to be Admiral Gial Ackbar actor Tim Rose in an email from Rose. Many of the lines were given to other Rebel pilots whose roles were cut as well, including a Sullustan and a human. The lines included mentioning that he was in range, that he was losing power, as well as a warning to stay clear, as a nearby starship was going to explode, among others. Rose utilized the same puppet for Sulko that was used to film closeup shots on the face of Admiral Ackbar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
