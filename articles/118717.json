The SGS-S1 was developed over the course of a decade by Sienar, who designed it to be able to survive long battles and have a limited close combat capacity. In exchange for a limited sensor range and ammunition capacity, the Condor could carry dogfighting missiles and more powerful short-range laser cannons as its secondary and close-range weaponry, and was more maneuverable than most other gunships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The SGS-S1 Condor is one of the five gunship models available to Republic players in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Galactic Starfighter, a 2013 Digital Expansion to the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.
