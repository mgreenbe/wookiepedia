While many casinos maintained organic dealers, a wide variety of others from the stylish Trest Casino to the seedy Crystal Jewel used these droid dealers instead due to a number of advantages. They were cheaper to operate and did not accept tips from the players, which meant more money to be played and lost. They were also good at spotting cheats, using high-speed photoreceptors and processors to keep track of every card dealt, though on occasion just like organic dealers, they themselves were ordered to cheat. Even cheap droid dealers were expensive to replace, and so such a situation was risky if the players discovered this and had a blaster on hand."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notable models"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
