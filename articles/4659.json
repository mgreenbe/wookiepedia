He became a member of the Jedi Order and attended the Almas Academy, a Jedi academy that was located on the planet Almas, in the Cularin system. While there, he trained to become a Jedi Consular, a Jedi specialization that focused on studying the mysteries of the Force.

The celebration had been organized by the Metatheran Cartel, a trade organization that was jointly run by members of the Caarite and Filordus species. They had organized the event to thank a group of freelance agents for preventing the release of a dangerous virus on the Caarite homeworld."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kel Dor Jedi Guardian Krin D'bis was chosen to accompany Akial. Due their different specializations within the order, they could represent different approaches to being a Jedi and show that the order was not single-minded. They traveled to Greentree Pointe resort on Dorumaa, where the celebration was being held and they set up a booth there, to try and recruit potential students for the Academy. While at the celebration, Akial and D'bis debated the threat posed by the Believers, a Sith cult that operated in the Cularin system. They both agreed that the Believers were a major problem for the system, but disagreed over how to deal with the cult. D'bis suggested that the Believers should be hunted down, but Akial thought that it would be better to investigate the capabilities of the cult, as little was known about what their goals were. They also discussed the Metatheran Cartel, which had committed many past transgressions in the Cularin system, such as destroying the sacred ch'hala tree grove. Akial believed that the Cartel should be forgiven if it re-established its diplomatic position in the system and demonstrated itself to be trustworthy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Akial was a Jawa, a diminutive sentient species that was native to the planet Tatooine, in the Outer Rim Territories.

The campaign was a supplement to the Star Wars Roleplaying Game, and Paarty On! was an interactive scenario, which was intended for use at roleplaying events. The scenario outlined how event staff would play the roles of the various non-player characters, such as Akial, and interact with players of the campaign. It encouraged the people playing Akial and D'bis to involve the players in their debate about the Believers and the Cartel, and to also discuss the nature of the Force with them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
