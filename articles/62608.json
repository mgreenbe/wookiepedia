Salm disagreed with Antilles, stating that\u2014at sixteen standard years old\u2014Darklighter was too young for the elite unit. Antilles countered with the fact that, despite his age, Darklighter would find his way into a cockpit somewhere in the military regardless. Eventually, Salm agreed to consider Darklighter for a position in the squadron if he scored well on the Redemption scenario.

While Antilles was grateful to the general for returning and saving his unit, Salm told him that he had to report the whole truth about his actions. He also revealed to Antilles that, in hindsight, it was a good thing that they hadn't taken Borleias. The Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Eviscerator was only four hours away from the planet, stationed in the Venjagga system, and could have responded to their assault. Antilles was amazed that the operation had been green-lit with the knowledge that an Imperial Star Destroyer was so close by. During their meeting, they were interrupted by Lieutenants Horn of Rogue Squadron and Judder Page of the Katarn Commandos. Through analysis of data collected by Horn's astromech droid, Whistler, they had determined the location of Blackmoon, and Page was sure that his commandos could use a meteor shower to cover their infiltration into the base to capture it and disable the ion cannons. They also discovered that the base's power generators were supplemented from the abandoned biotics facility, and that the installation also housed two squadrons of TIE interceptors that the original intelligence reports had failed to spot. Armed with this new knowledge, Salm and Antilles devised a plan to take the planet, and took it to Ackbar. Salm's plan called for the Emancipator and the Liberator to stage a feint at the Eviscerator's home port while Rogue Squadron and the commandos hit Borleias."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two Star Destroyers dropped out of hyperspace in the Venjagga system and deployed Salm's Defender Wing and a wing of other fighters. The Eviscerator deployed its own wing of fighters and moved to engage the New Republic force. However, as the mission was a feint to draw attention away from Borleias, the fighters were not moving at full speed, and the entire force gave the impression of being reluctant to engage in a fight. When the Eviscerator had reached a point where the system's planetary bodies restricted the vessel's hyperspace entry vectors, the New Republic fighters\u2014which were deployed and positioned in a region of the system unencumbered by such gravity wells\u2014entered hyperspace, heading for Borleias. However, the Star Destroyers headed for Ord Mirit in the Mirit system to further draw the Eviscerator away from Borleias. Bothan slicers had planted information on the HoloNet that Ord Mirit held the key to finding the location of the legendary Katana fleet, an armada of two hundred Dreadnaught-class heavy cruisers that had been lost when the crews succumbed to a hive virus, slaved the ship's controls together, and jumped to an unknown location. After recovering its fighters, the Imperial Star Destroyer headed to Ord Mirit. Meanwhile, Salm led Defender Wing against Borleias, capitalizing on the strike that members of Rogue Squadron enacted to cut the power conduit linking the main Imperial base to the biotics facility. Borleias fell to the New Republic, and Salm and Defender Wing were stationed at the planet to assist in protecting their new asset.

Salm was selected\u2014along with Ackbar and General Crix Madine\u2014to preside over the trial of Tycho Celchu. Celchu was charged with murder and treason, following acts that he was supposed to have committed while assisting Rogue Squadron during their infiltration mission to Coruscant to bring down the planet's shields. These acts included conspiring with a known Imperial Intelligence agent\u2014one Kirtan Loor\u2014and the murder of Corran Horn by causing the Z-95 Headhunter he was flying to crash by overriding the flight controls using the command codes. Antilles questioned Rogue pilot Nawara Ven, who was acting as Celchu's legal counsel, if Salm could be removed from the tribunal due to his well-documented suspicion of Celchu. Ven pointed out that if Salm didn't excuse himself, then he did not believe there to be any conflict of interest on his part, and any attempt to remove him may actually work against the case, causing him to become even more biased against Celchu than they already believed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, despite the New Republic's victory in capturing the capital, they were left with a problem. Prior to their liberation of Coruscant, Director Isard\u2014now ruler of the Empire\u2014had released a virulent man-made disease known as the Krytos virus into the planet's water system. It was designed to target most non-Human species; Isard had hoped to both give the New Republic a devastated world, and to tie them up with relief operations. In addition, a large amount of bacta was known to cure the disease outright; with the New Republic's need for bacta at an all-time high, the price for the cure-all fluid rocketed. Even with the bacta cartels on the planet Thyferra producing as much as they could, the New Republic still needed more. When a bacta convoy was hijacked by the Imperial warlord Admiral Zsinj, and taken to an Empress-class space station in the Yag'Dhul system, General Salm's Defender Wing was part of the operation to liberate the bacta and take it to Coruscant. By this point, Guardian Squadron had been outfitted with B-wing starfighters, adding more firepower to the wing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Salm presided over weeks of testimony during Celchu's trial, until the day that Corran Horn unexpectedly returned from the presumed dead with evidence that Celchu was innocent of all charges, and that the traitor was actually Erisi Dlarit, a Thyferran serving with Rogue Squadron. Horn had actually been captured by Isard and interred at Lusankya\u2014which was, in reality, an Executor-class Star Dreadnaught buried beneath Coruscant's cityscape. During this revelation, the Lusankya broke free of the planet, laying waste to huge swaths of the city as it escaped into orbit. Salm was surprised by this turn of events, and angry when he learned that General Airen Cracken, head of New Republic Intelligence, had known that Celchu was innocent all along. He was indignant that his fellow officer had allowed him to berate, suspect, and treat Celchu with disdain, all the while knowing the truth. Cracken replied that while he knew that Celchu was not the traitor within Rogue Squadron, he could not be sure that he wasn't an Imperial agent of some sort. The trial concluded with all charges against Celchu dropped, and a story released to the media that the entire affair was part of an elaborate plan to draw out the real traitor and that Celchu had been in on the deception from the beginning.

They chose to topple Prince-Admiral Delak Krennel, who had set himself up as ruler of the Ciutric Hegemony following the death of Sate Pestage several years earlier. Using the murder of Pestage and his family as the reason for their campaign, Admiral Ackbar chaired a briefing of the situation which included Salm, the newly-promoted General Antilles, Admirals Kir Vantai and Areta Bell, and Commander Sair Yonka. Ackbar outlined the plan to take the planet Liinade III away from Hegemony, which Salm commented would prove to Krennel's subjects that his realm was not as well-defended as he claimed.

The Hegemony ship disgorged a wing of seventy-two TIE fighters and interceptors, matching Salm's number of craft. The B-wings engaged the Hegemony fighters, with Rogue Squadron providing top cover.

A strict disciplinarian, Salm knew that many of the pilots he had under his command were not of the same caliber as the elite Rogues, and therefore had to be drilled harder to watch each other's backs, and function as a unit rather than individuals, to make up for the lack of innate talent. Although he was generally a by-the-book officer,\u2014willing to charge individual pilots like Lieutenant Horn over actions that actually saved his own command since he himself had disobeyed a direct order\u2014he was also savvy enough to realize that the needs of the mission sometimes outweighed the needs of protocol, and rescinded the charges so that Horn's presence on a future mission may have saved them. Salm generally followed mission orders to the letter, except on two occasions; both times saw his unit rescue Rogue Squadron.

He held firm to his belief that Celchu could not be trusted at all, and pointed out that fact\u2014and the possibility of him being a security liability\u2014every time a breach of security of improbable coincidence occurred. However, Salm was genuinely concerned for the security of the units under his command, and that of the New Republic. Knowing exactly what Ysanne Isard was capable of, he knew how much damage an Imperial agent with the New Republic's elite unit could cause. However, Salm did not see his distrust of Celchu as a personal issue, and saw no reason to excuse himself as a judge at the officer's trial.
