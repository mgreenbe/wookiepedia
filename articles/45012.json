They were two meters tall and resembled shambling mounds made up of plant materials and had droopy slimy appendages of various lengths and sizes. A fully grown Ergesh could weigh up to a half of a metric ton. They had an average lifespan of 200 standard years. Their coloration consisted of green, brown and gray. The younger Ergesh had more green, the elders more brown. A strong smell of ammonia and rotting vegetation followed an Ergesh wherever it went."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Reproduction was accomplished by two Ergesh who would each plant a seed from their bodies in the Shoolbloorp Swamp during a special mating ceremony. Twenty days later, a young Ergesh rose up from the ground, self-aware and ready to join the society. Being asexual beings, Ergesh had no concept of gender. Each Ergesh could produce one seed every two Ergeshui years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite their bulk and weight, they could float on water. Due to their physiology, they could breathe underwater, though they preferred \"dry\" land. Their wet, thick skin also acted as a strong protective layer against weapons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ergesh did not have faces in the accepted sense of the word. A number of the smaller tentacles were actually opticstalks, the Ergesh equivalent of eyes, while others were sensitive to sound waves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ergesh could not get intoxicated, drugged, or poisoned by most substances. Their immune systems broke down such substances quickly, and their natural secretions carried out the harmful or waste elements. The Ergesh could consume Kaloob in order to cleanse themselves from harmful microorganisms."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ergesh weren't fast and were poor combatants, with their most effective attack being simply trampling over their opponents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ergesh were highly intelligent, curious, and gentle beings. Their native language was said to sound like thick mud coming out of a rapid boil, though most members of the species preferred to speak Basic. Ergesh personal names were long affairs, with many odd bubbling noises included. Fortunately, they tolerated being given nicknames by off-worlders they interacted with."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once every year, on Ergeshui, came a day when both moons were aligned in a certain way, with devastating effect upon the Ergesh. During this period, they acted irrational, violent, or even insane."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ergesh were divided into clans, which had formed a federation that ruled their planet. There were a total of 80 clans, each with about 10,000 members. The eldest Ergesh from each clan was a part of the governing body. This government met monthly in the Communal Pool. The Ergesh federation kept in regular contact with the leaders of the New Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In their dealings with each other, Ergesh were honest and fair. They were a society with no classes, no discrimination, and no wants. There was no crime among the species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ergesh possessed amazing bio-technology which included living starships called Starjumpers. Their weapons were small plant buds that could be thrown at a target and would deliver an electrical shock on contact. Their buildings were all organic, and semi-sentient enough to recognize residents and block intruders from entering."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ergesh supported the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
