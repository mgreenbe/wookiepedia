Vette exchanged several masters, ending with a Gran \"Three Eyes\" by the age of seven or eight. She was rescued from slavery by the legendary pirate Nok Drayen and accepted an offer to join his crew, befriending his daughter Risha. After several years Vette left Nok Drayen's gang and joined with Twi'lek artifact hunters Taunt, Plasmajack, and Flash, returning stolen Twi'lek artifacts to their people.

During this time, Vette reconnected with her old gang, helping Taunt and the others retrieve a priceless artifact called the Star of Kala'unn from Cada Bliss. Gaining access to Imperial communications and some money of her own, Vette hired a tracker to search for her family, locating her sister Tivva on Nar Shaddaa and buying her freedom.

Gault recruited the Alliance that opposed Zakuul to aid them, while sending Vette to retrieve a warhead from a missile he ordered from the Brekken Gang on Vandin. The Alliance members Senya Tirall and SCORPIO infiltrated the ship's bridge and opened a path for Vette and Gault to sneak inside, where Vette disabled the ship vault's security mechanisms, allowing Gault to plant the missile warhead inside. The warhead's detonation vaporized the vault' entire content of precious metals that was then pumped into the Alliance tanker, after which Vette and Gault traveled to the Alliance base on Odessen and decided to join the cause, later participating in the battle of Odessen. While reclaiming the Gravestone from the Eternal Empress Vaylin, Vette and other Alliance personnel were trapped by ARIES on the artificial world called Iokath, where Vette worked closely with the Alliance Commander to find their way out and escape before the world was covered in a radiation pulse. When Vaylin launched an assault on Odessen, Vette joined the defense, using Vette missile launchers to destroy enemy heavy.

Ce'na was then separated from her mother and sister, sold to Rodian, then to a Hutt and ending with a Gran she dubbed \"Three Eyes\" by the time she was seven or eight years old. When the legendary pirate of the Syndicate Wars Nok Drayen destroyed the holdings of Three Eyes, Ce'na, along with the other slaves, was given a choice to either be free and find their own path in the galaxy, or join Drayen Crime Syndicate. Not about to wander off without even knowing what planet she was on, Ce'na accepted the offer and joined Nok's crew as its smallest member, learned new tricks to get in and out of places she wasn't supposed to.

The four of them were young, idealistic and full of Twi'lek pride, returning stolen Twi'lek artifacts to their people. They scammed a rich Duros Cada Bliss, who was obsessed with Twi'lek women, artifacts and clothing, taking everything of worth that he had. At one point Vette found a cave on Corrida, which she almost died exploring.

Vette was imprisoned for the sixteenth time in the jail of Korriban Sith Academy, fitted with a shock collar around her neck by jailer Knash, who repeatedly used it to shock the Twi'lek for her insolent attitude.

Jailer Knash gave the shock collar activator to the Sith Warrior and instructed the Sith on how to use it to keep the Twi'lek in line. Vette accompanied the apprentice into the Tomb she already broke into once, and activated the statues, opening the passage and allowing the Sith to claim an ancient lightsaber. The Sith returned to Darth Baras and was formally taken in as the apprentice to the Sith Lord, being allowed by their new master to keep Vette around as a slave.

The Sith Warrior's path then took them to Nar Shaddaa, the world with which Vette already was well familiar, as well Tatooine and Alderaan. The actions of Baras' apprentice there prompted Nomen Karr to seek a direct confrontation and the Sith engaged the Jedi Master in a duel on Hutta, which ended with them taking Karr's apprentice Jaesa Willsaam as their own."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Baras then enacted his Plan Zero, sending his apprentice to eliminate members of Republic War Trust on Taris and Jedi Knight Xerender on Hoth, where their crew grew to including Lieutenant Pierce and a Talz named Broonmark.

However, the apprentice was rescue by the Emperor's Hand and given the title of the Emperor's Wrath. Now tasked with undermining Baras' power base, the new Emperor's Wrath stopped Baras' sister Darth Ekkage from escaping Belsavis prison and freed the Emperor's Voice from being trapped in the Dark Heart on Voss. Although Vette wasn't too keen on the idea of going against a Sith Lord, the Wrath reassured her that they would have the vengeance for their betrayal. The Wrath and their crew then traveled to Corellia, where Vette and the rest of the Sith's companions were tasked to safeguard Vowrawn back on the Empire's Wrath's Fury-class Imperial interceptor.

Now having a fearsome Kaleesh bodyguard called The Virus, Bliss has obtained a priceless artifact of Twi'lek history called the Star of Kala'unn and was trying to find a buyer for it at the Mezenti Spaceport on Nar Shaddaa. Vette wanted to reclaim the Star of Kala'unn and pay back the one whose actions resulted in her second enslavement, convincing Baras' apprentice to accompany here. They confronted the Duros and Vette made a prepared speech, but the conversation turned violent and ended with the Sith killing the Virus, with Vette forcing Bliss to give up the Star of Kala'unn and promise her that he would reform. Having recovered the Star of Kala'unn, Vette reunited with her friends and handed over the Star to them to be put in a museum.

Vette and the Sith approached Tivva through Crystal, finding her working as an exotic dancer, who initially did not recognize her little sister. Vette then spoke up and Tivva was shocked to see her little sister again, addressing Ce'na by her birth name, which came as a news to the Sith Warrior.

Vette provided money to give her mother aa proper burial, during which her body was cremated. Tivva then became enraged at the Hutt who worked her mother to death and decided to kill him. The Sith encouraged it, and the two girls snuck inside the Hutt's palace and killed him, though the experience changed Vette, who almost immediately regretted the act and later blamed the Sith for talking her into doing it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vette remained along the new Emperor's Wrath for years after the Wrath killed their old master Darth Baras. In 3637 BBY the Wrath experienced a vision aboard the ship, and Vette remarked that the look on their face resembled the one Jaesa Willsaam had when she tried the exoboar soup. The Wrath explained to have a Force vision of the galaxy and a dwarf galaxy going dark, at which point Malavai Quinn interjected, asking if the Wrath was referring to the Rishi Maze. Recognizing the name, Vette recalled a pirate planet called Rishi and mentioned that she always had a desire to visit there.

By 3630 BBY she partnered with a Devaronian con artist Gault Rennow and the two came up with a plan to rob the Gilded Star, a treasury ship used by the Eternal Empire to keep the valuables that was hiding deep in the atmosphere of Gas giant Vandin. The ship's vault was so strong, it could survive the rest of the ship being reduced to atoms, which gave Gault and Vette an idea on how to empty it of valuables. Gault placed on order for a functional missile with the Brekken Gang, asking the Nikto to deliver it to Vandin, while also sending Vette to sneak in and retrieve the missile's warhead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The heist also required specific personnel to fill key roles.

The Nikto ran away trying to flee the blast, but Gault was unable to stop the countdown and it reached zero, only to reveal that Vette was playing a prank on him, having already detached the warhead and waiting inside the missile tube for the opportune moment. Everyone then assembled at the hideout, where Gault and Vette laid out their plan, assigning everybody their roles. An Anomid identity slicer Dretcher would fake the identity of High Justice Vaylin for her mother Senya Tirall, who provided a genetic match and required character knowledge and would take SCORPIO aboard as her \"attache droid\".

Inside the vault, Gault planted the missile warhead, which upon detonation vaporized its entire content of precious metals, while leaving everything outside the vault safe and intact. The vault's entire content of precious metals was then pumped into the tanker piloted by Lana Beniko and Theron Shan, while SCORPIO and Senya soon joined them. Vette, Gault and the Alliance Commander made their own escape, during which Vette was amazed by the destructive capability of her new weapon, but encountered some difficulties when the only escape route left for them was to take the Skyhook down the way they came. Their path was blocked by real Vaylin, who arrived with an inspection, and determined to avoid confronting her at all cost, Gault suggested going outside on the ship's hull, which Vette deemed tolerable as long as one did not look down.

They both later participated in the Battle of Odessen, in which the Alliance managed to dethrone Emperor Arcann, only for his sister Vaylin to ally with SCORPIO and claim the Eternal Throne instead. Later, following the Invasion of Voss in 3630 BBY, rumors spread that the Commander was killed on Dromund Kaas and former Republic Supreme Chancellor Leontyne Saresh arrived in an attempt to take over the Alliance.

She managed to contact and interact with a holographic AI called ARIES, who provided to Vette the history of Iokath, which turned out to be tied to SCORPIO, the Eternal Fleet and the GEMINI droids. The Alliance Commander and Vette showed them her findings, getting ARIES to reveal a list of planets that the Iokath creators used to test their weapons, which turned out to include Zakuul. Their connection to ARIES was then interrupted by SCORPIO, who was imprisoned at an unknown location and asked the Commander for assistance. Their group's position came under attack from the droids again and Theron Shan activates the force field that prevented more droids from coming in, but also trapped the Alliance inside.
