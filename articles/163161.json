A female waterspout was present as a manager at Crseih Station's Crater Lodge in 14 ABY where Lord Hethrir and other members of the Empire Reborn movement were lodging while trading in kidnapped alien slaves and paying a visit to the mysterious \"faith-healer\" Waru. Prior to a skirmish on the station, she reprimanded Leia Organa Solo's son Jacen for allowing his pet bat-like tappratine to feed on an expensive fish from the pools which decorated the lodge. In response, Rillao offered to compensate for the loss by having the fish placed on their hotel account."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
