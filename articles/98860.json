The supplement provided this benefit, but did not possess any flavor. It was processed from a small green plant that leeched the nutrients out of any soil it was grown in, and destroyed other plants grown near it. Due to this property, the Empire took over the remote farming moon of Raada to grow the plant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
