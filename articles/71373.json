He often performed duets with Sy Snootles. Shortly before the Battle of Endor, Yowza and the rest of the band performed at Jabba the Hutt's palace on the planet Tatooine. The performance came to a halt when Jabba dropped his slave dancer Oola into the rancor pit, as Yowza gasped in horror. Among Jabba's courtiers, there were many people who disliked Yowza's voice and dreamed of silencing him brutally. The Hutt, however, appeared to like the Yuzzum singer, and Jabba's opinion was the only one that mattered in his palace. At some point, Yowza left the band and was to do a solo concert at Oga's Cantina on Batuu a few rotations after the skirmish at Kat Saka's farm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Joh Yowza was added to the extended musical number in the Special Edition of Return of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
