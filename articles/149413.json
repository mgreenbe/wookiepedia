After their discovery, these deadly cat-like creatures were sold across the galaxy for use as trained hunters and trackers. Due to their savage behavior and given some incidents where bystanders were badly mauled, the Republic made prowler breeding illegal and almost all the creatures were released into the wild. They could be found on a great many planets, such as Quesh, where their predatory skills allowed them to hunt smaller and slower creatures and, sometimes, also to attack sentients who were unlucky enough to find themselves near one of these beasts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
