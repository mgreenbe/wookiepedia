The most basic droid brain defense system models simply warned their users of threats and indicated positions of ideal cover through haptic interface or by voice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "More advanced models of such systems incorporated a complex system of motors or even repulsorlift generators throughout the armor to throw the wearer out of the way of incoming fire. The droid brains often developed highly paranoid personalities, and their earnest attempts to protect their master even outside of combat could prove highly inconvenient."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
