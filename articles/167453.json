The weapon fired grenades equal in power to hand grenades but smaller in size, although it was capable of launching hand grenades. The ammunition grenades could not be thrown by hand, and cost the same as normal hand grenades, although some merchants sold cases of six at half price during the Galactic Civil War between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Galactic Empire. The Z50 had less firing options then a missile launcher and was less powerful, but was lighter to carry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Z50 was first shown in Dangerous Covenants a sourcebook released in 2014 for the Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying game produced by Fantasy Flight Games."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
