The dish consisted of a plant-based loaf served with Ithor-raised vegetables, and a mushroom sauce made with either snoruuks from Gamorr or mushrooms from nearby Yakorki. Explorer and author Eloc Throno recommended the dish in his Traveler's Guide to Batuu, describing it as lacking in meat but not lacking in flavor. The dish shared its name with the Ithorian species, and the Ithorian antiquities dealer Dok-Ondar was quite fond of it. Although it was suitable for human consumption, Resistance spy Vi Moradi preferred meat and asked Chadra-Fan Kriki to buy other foods to feed her team."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ithorian Garden Loaf is one of the dishes sold to customers at the Docking Bay 7 Food and Cargo food stall in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge.
