Initially, the crimson bodyguards appeared to flank the risen Sith Lord while he spoke to Rey about her destiny to rule the Sith as Empress. They surrounded Rey, preventing her escape and further augmenting her to accept Palpatine's proposal. Unbeknownst to them nor the Dark Lord, Ben Solo had arrived on Exegol using a TIE scout and was racing to Rey's location. Rey then feigned agreeing to the Dark Lord's terms and followed the rituals of the ceremony up until it was time to strike down her grandfather. The Protectors remained watchful of the ritual until it was clear that the girl was not going along with the plan. Solo killed several guardsmen with a blaster before the Knights of Ren confronted him, while the guards in the throne room opened fire on Rey after she refused her grandfather's entreaty to succeed him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As soon as Rey ignited Leia's lightsaber in defiance to Darth Sidious' offer, the Dark Lord retreated in his mechanics while the Protectors all at once stepped forward to kill the youth. Despite their numerical advantage, none of the Sovereign Protectors succeeded in harming Rey, whose bond with Solo augmented her Force powers. The Jedi apprentice defeated all but one of the guardsmen using her command of the Force to redirect their blaster fire at themselves and their comrades. The last Sovereign Protector was defeated by the telekinetic skills of Solo, who arrived in the throne room to stand with Rey as a dyad in the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Organization"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A military rank similar to that of the Old Empire's Royal Guard, individuals of this position acted as the personal guards of Darth Sidious.
