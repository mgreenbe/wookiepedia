During the Drogheda Civil War, the Drogheda Revolutionaries captured the mine in order to force Queen Sarna to agree to their demands to set up a democratic government. As the mine was the primary source of income for the ruling class, Sanra was forced to look for outside help in removing the revolutionaries from the mine. Lando Calrissian eventually aided Sanra in removing the revolutionaries after he destroyed several water tanks in the mine. The mine was flooded by water, washing Calrissian and the rebels out of the mine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
