When Jigoba died, Ploovo fled to the Corporate Sector with as many profits as possible before Jabba the Hutt's organization filled the void. He began muscling his way into the Sector's nightclub circuit, first as a silent partner, later stepping up as outright boss. As he bought up many of the seedier clubs on major trade worlds, his power and influence grew, and soon he had a hand in the vast majority of protection rackets and loan sharking efforts within Corporate Sector space. At some point, Ploovo also worked as a bunko-steerer out of the Cron Drift."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 5 BBY, rival loan shark Thar Lasan of the Corporate Sector died in mysterious circumstances, but it was suspected that Ploovo was involved in the demise.

He was regarded as too subtle, even timid, to be effective in the Empire, and he avoided getting his hands dirty personally, turning more unsavory work over to affiliated gangs. He was also regarded as lacking taste, despite his large collection of fake-gemstone pinky rings. However, he nonetheless had begun to use his Corporate Sector power base to expand into the rest of the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ploovo never got over the damage done to him by the dinko Han gave him, and for a time paid for people to bring him dinkos, dead or alive.
