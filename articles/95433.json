He was a restless explorer who spent most of his time on distant worlds searching for new vistas. The Naboo Royal Advisory Council eventually suggested that Narml\u00e9 relinquish his throne and become an ambassador instead. Before Narml\u00e9 left office as king, he planned the construction of a new settlement on the Nabooian moon of Rori. He envisioned Rori becoming an active agricultural hub one day, supplying food and medicines to other neighboring planets. However, Rori attracted only few settlers. Frustrated, Narml\u00e9 left Rori and vanished into the Outer Rim forever."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 1 ABY, the city he had helped build still bore his name, Narmle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
