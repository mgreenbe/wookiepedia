Senator Aak tells him that the Y-wings require field-testing for at least another three weeks and are therefore not ready yet. The Jedi offers to field-test the starfighters himself, but Ask Aak still refuses. Skywalker expresses his disappointment and cuts off communications, and after talking things over with his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, he decides that he will obtain the starfighters himself. Skywalker, his personal astromech droid R2-D2, Tano, and Shadow Squadron take off in the Twilight, Skywalker's personal G9 Rigger freighter.

At first, the clone troopers guarding the Y-wings don't allow the pilots near the ships since they don't have the proper authorization. However, Broadside and Matchstick argue, since they have a Jedi with them that outranks the guards. Meanwhile, R2-D2 gives the worker falsified documents saying that Skywalker is permitted to take the fighters. The Gran, though, refuses the Jedi's request, saying it violates procedure. However, when Skywalker and Tano threaten to tell the Supreme Chancellor about how the Gran delayed their efforts, the worker allows the Jedi to take the fighters.
