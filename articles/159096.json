One day, some pirates attacked the Imperial Combat Assault Transports transporting rhydonium to the refinery. Juggernaut Five was the only transport to make it to the base, and was celebrated by the personnel there. At that time, Hess sat at the officers' mess, conversing with another officer. His attention was soon caught when one of the Juggernaut Pilots from Juggernaut Five entered the room and then turned back. The pilot was Migs Mayfeld, a  former member of Hess's division and survivor of Burnin Konn who was infiltrating the base disguised as in Imperial uniform."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fearing being recognized by his former commanding officer Hess, Mayfeld made his accomplice Din Djarin enter the room and consult the terminal as part of their mission. Hess, having watched them converse outside the mess, observed Djarin enter and give a salute before going to the terminal. Continuing to watch, the general saw Djarin fail to scan his face before removing his helmet to resolve the issue. Hess called over to the apparent pilot, who did not show any attention to the call. The general thus rose from his seat and walked over to Djarin, telling him off for not paying attention and asking his TK number."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Djarin hesitated to provide a TK number, and so Mayfeld chimed into the exchange, claiming Djarin was TK-593 and that he was Lieutenant TK-111. Mayfeld further stated that Hess had to speak up to Djarin as his starship had allegedly lost pressure at the planet Taanab. Raising his voice, Hess asked Djarin for his name, to which the apparent pilot again hesitated before Mayfeld said that the \"trooper\" was referred to as \"Brown Eyes.\" Mayfeld then attempted to leave with Djarin, providing the excuse that the pair needed to fill out TPS reports and recharge power coils.

The general inquired for Mayfeld to elaborate, and the \"trooper\" asked if the sacrifice was good for those who had died at Burnin Konn and their families. Hess, though, added that they had outlasted those who had died, and that the Imperial remnant was growing stronger in the face of a New Republic that was \"in disarray.\" He further brought up the prospect of using the rhydonium that Juggernaut Five had delivered to create more havoc than had been made at Burnin Konn, hoping that people would realize as a result that they want order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hess raised his cup to the Empire, but Mayfeld instead raised his SE-14r light repeating blaster and shot the general through the chest.

He curiously observed Mayfeld and Djarin upon first seeing them, and pressed the latter on who he was after watching him fumble at a terminal.

When filming the conversation between Hess, Djarin, and Mayfeld, Famuyiwa wanted to present a more quiet scene to contrast the frequent action typically shown in Star Wars and also to present a tense exchange between people with competing agendas who are trying to find out about each other. The director's ultimate goals for the episode was to present a moral gray area in the use and transfers of power."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
