The smuggler managed to run afoul of both the Rebel Alliance and another individual while running weapons into an Imperial controlled sector. The Alliance sent agent Kyle Katarn to handle the smuggler's operation, while the individual sent his Gran bodyguard to deal with the smuggler. Katarn and the Gran eventually crossed paths, and after a presumed misunderstanding of the others goals, they engaged in a firefight that left the Gran with a blaster injury in his leg. Katarn disposed of the smuggler's operation soon after. Later during 5 ABY, the Gran and Katarn encountered each other again on the moon Nar Shaddaa, where the Gran inquired whether or not Katarn remembered their past encounter. Katarn didn't remember their encounter at all, however."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
