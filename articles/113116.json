She also claimed that Luke Skywalker's real name was Luke Cloddplodder and he joined a gang called the O'Kenoby gang made up of Benny \"Wiseman\" O'Kenoby (Obi-Wan Kenobi), Hansel \"Lightning Hands\" Shooter (Han Solo), Chewie \"Shaggy\" Baccarat (Chewbacca) and he was known as \"Babyface.\" She further claimed that the gang went around in the Century Turkey and cheated at podraces, faked odds at fathier tracks, ran gambling rackets so whenever they appeared to be losing Chewie would get angry at the unfortunate player, and did smuggling jobs but didn't return the goods in favor of sending them to an auction. Redy also believed the gang faked Luke's ability to use the Force, believing Luke didn't use mind control but it was a basic hypnosis gag and that they blindfolded Luke and he waved a flaming torch and deflected the blaster bolts from the droids but the droids were shooting at the brightest object."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She also said that the Death Star was fake and that the destruction of Alderaan was the result of\ncarefully placed proton torpedos along tectonic-plate fault lines.
