The Wookiees were sometimes treated as mere animals, and several times slaver organizations such as Czerka Corporation or the Mytaranor Slaving Council set up operations in the sector to exploit them as slave labor. The Trandoshans, on the other hand, often worked with the slavers, or were employed as bounty hunters around the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mytaranor sector was located in the Mid Rim, in the region known as the Slice. This sector bordered the Lantillian, Taldot, Kastolar, Trax, and Terr'skiar sectors. The sector featured several trade routes such as the Randon Run, which connected the Perlemian Trade Route to Randon; the Ootmian Pabol, linking Randon to the Hutt capital of Nal Hutta; and others. The Thornhedge Nebula, which formed from the remains of the Kyyr system after it went supernova, forms part of the boundary between this sector and the Terr'skiar sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mytaranor sector was the center of the Kashyyyk Region, which contained parts of six other sectors, five of which bordered the Mytaranor. The Kashyyyk system, aside from being a trade hub at the intersection of six hyperspace routes, was home to two native species: the Wookiees of Kashyyyk, and the Trandoshans of Trandosha. Kashyyyk was a planet of giant wroshyr trees covering all land a kilometer in from the shores. The Wookiees themselves were a hair-covered mammalian species who made their homes on the treetops and on the shores. The Trandoshans were a lizard-like reptilian species. The moons of Alaris were settled by Wookiees in 32 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planets of Kwookrrr and Rakhuuun were both Wookiee colonies, the former being infamous for its slave factories and farms during the Imperial Period.

When the Rakata left, their Force-powered machinery continued working and produced the massive wroshyr trees that Kashyyyk became famous for. Wroshyr trees also somehow arrived on Alaris Prime, a moon of the gas giant Alaris in the Kashyyyk system. The sector was explored by the Galactic Republic somewhere between 20,000 BBY and 8000 BBY. Republic scouts charted the Ootmian Pabol from Gyndine through the Mytaranor sector and into Hutt Space around 12,000 BBY."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Old Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sector was a minor battleground in the Old Sith Wars. The Sith attacked Randon as part of their assault on the Slice during the time of Exar Kun. The Randon system was again attacked in 3962 BBY during the Mandalorian Wars. There was a battle won by the Sith during the Jedi Civil War at Randon.

There was also a skirmish on Alaris Prime later."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the last years of the Old Republic, the Mytaranor sector was represented in the Galactic Senate by Yarua, a Wookiee. Shortly before the Invasion of Naboo, a group of Wookiees lead by Attichitcuk received permission to colonize Alaris Prime. This brought them into conflict with the Trade Federation, which had secretly taken the moon to exploit its resources. The Wookiee colonists fought off the Trade Federation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Separatist Crisis and subsequent Clone Wars, the Mytaranor sector was divided between the Separatists and Loyalists. Whereas Kashyyyk and its neighbors were Loyalists, Randon and its neighbors were Separatists during most of the war. During the Outer Rim Sieges Randon was back in Republic control, but the Confederacy staged an assault upon Kashyyyk. Order 66 was issued to the Clone Army during this battle, and Jedi Master Yoda narrowly escaped."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Declaration of a New Order, it came under the authority of the Moff of Sector 3, apparently a larger territory with its headquarters on Bimmisaari in Halla sector. During the Imperial Period, the Mytaranor sector was plagued by attacks of the Mytaranor Slaving Council. The Sector was far away from most of the Imperial activities and slaves were \"needed\" to make the most of the natural resources. Due to Wookiee loyalty to the Jedi, the planet of Kashyyyk was subject to several Imperial attacks during the Great Jedi Purge. Kashyyyk was again a battleground in the Galactic Civil War. In 4 ABY, it was the site of the opening of the Nagai invasion. Later that year Kashyyyk was liberated by the New Republic from Imperial rule, and it is likely that the rest of the sector was as well."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "After the Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mytaranor sector, or Kashyyyk at least, was loyal to the New Republic through all the crises in its time.

After the war, the Mytaranor became part of the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, the successor state to the New Republic. Senator Triebakk of the Mytaranor sector even became part of the High Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Second Galactic Civil War, tbe Wookiees of the Mytaranor tried to remain neutral while they debated the correct course of action to take. This would not save Kashyyyk from an attack from Galactic Alliance Chief of State and fallen Jedi Jacen Solo, who led a bombardment on the surface of the forested world. This action provoked a split from the Galactic Alliance by the Jedi Order, who form the Jedi Coalition. Kashyyyk, and possibly other Wookiee worlds, were part of this coalition until the end of the war and the reintegration back into the Galactic Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 137 ABY, the Mytaranor sector was part of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Senators"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "All known Senators of the Mytaranor sector have been Wookiees."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Randoni"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Snogar"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Trandoshans"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Wookiees"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
