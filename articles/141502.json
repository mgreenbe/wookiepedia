Temolaks often \"colonized\" abandoned space stations and then used them as bases of operations for more expansive salvage missions. Their persistence and willingness to salvage literally anything proved successful commercially, and independent Temolak salvage crews began competing with one another, and the competition grew fierce and deadly. Finally, the competition grew so violent and unprofitable that the crews banded together into a single consortium."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Centuries later, the Galactic Empire imposed strict salvage laws on the Consortium, and many Temolaks left the Consortium, returning to independent salvage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
