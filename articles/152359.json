In a bid to sway the votes in their favor, Separatist Head of State, Count Dooku tasked his droid commander, General Grievous, to transfer his demolition droids to Coruscant to blow up the power generator and scare the senators into voting for deregulation. When the droids attacked the compound, the engineer was in conversation with a fellow colleague, and was surprised to see the sweeper droids appear as the engineers did not schedule a cleaning for that day. He and the rest of the engineers were killed when the droids secured the power generator."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
