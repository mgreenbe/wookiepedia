However, after the rise of the New Order, the Galactic Empire's heavy demand for droids polluted the planet until it had to be abandoned. It was the only planet in the system containing it. It was impossible to discern any land masses from space due to the thick, sullen, gray smog in the planet's atmosphere. The air on the planet was extremely warm and damp, and it was extremely hard to tell whether it was raining at all due to the thick mist. The Empire used the abandoned world for their high-security penal compound, Prison Base, overseen by Commander deWolf."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
