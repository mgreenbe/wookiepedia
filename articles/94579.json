It consisted of a hollow military droid shell that Zott had attempted to make look intimidating, by fitting it with servomotors and a small power supply. He also attached some broom handles to it, which he had painted black to make them look like blaster rifles. In circa 31 BBY, Zott was hired by the Cerean Krol-Pek to travel to the planet Genarius and pick up the Sullustan Salld Nrump, and he flew there in his YT-1760 transport Panada's Kiss, accompanied by N4."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
