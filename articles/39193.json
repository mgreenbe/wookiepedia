Such cities were employed on planets or in planetary regions where natural environments were inhospitable to the physiology of their inhabitants. For example, the Geelan of the planet Needan used domed cities to protect themselves from their world's frigid temperatures. Similarly, the Bith species used domed cities to shelter themselves from the caustic atmosphere of their homeworld, Clak'dor VII. Sundari, the capital of the New Mandalorian faction on Mandalore, was also covered with a black dome due to inhospitable desert conditions. The Rodians of the planet Rodia also used domed cities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
