Jedi Master Yoda, accompanied by the astromech droid R2-D2, used the starfighter to go on a series of missions of discovery: travelling to Dagobah, to a mysterious planet inhabited by the Force Priestesses, and to Moraband. Similar to the standard Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor used by other Jedi, it had hexagonal panels at the end of its wings, an astromech socket, and a compact, sphere-shaped cockpit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
