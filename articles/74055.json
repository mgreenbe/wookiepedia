However, one of their medical products, Karakan gauntlets, could be acquired in parts of the galaxy at this time. The heavy gauntlets monitored the nervous impulses, blood pressure, and tension of the wearer through contact with their hands. The gauntlets were then able to adjust these life signs and produce an overall increase in stability and system integrity. This comprehensive package made the gauntlets virtually a complete medical computer in themselves, producing many benefits to the user. They were compatible with the physiologies of Cathar, Humans, Twi'leks, Wookiees, Miraluka, and Zabraks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Paaerduag merchant Mic'tunan'jus Orgu sold a pair of the gauntlets from his kiosk on Tatooine which were colored yellow with green stripes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Karakan were created for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, a computer roleplaying game produced by BioWare in 2003.
