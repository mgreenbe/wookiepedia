He engages her in a vicious lightsaber duel, lasting several minutes. In the end, Vader knocks a tree down with the Force, landing on top of the Dark Woman, incapacitating her. Vader goes over to her upper body, sticking out from beneath the tree, and stabs his lightsaber down, but the Dark Woman disappears, in much the same way Obi-Wan Kenobi will a year later. She appears as a Force ghost and tells Vader to let go of the dark side and return to being Anakin Skywalker. Vader refuses to do so, slashing his lightsaber through the Dark Woman's transparent form. She disappears, and Vader slowly walks back to his shuttle, successful in his mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The dialogue was altered between the two-part version found in Star Wars Tales 1 and Star Wars Tales 2 and the version in Star Wars Tales Volume 1, which combined the two parts.
