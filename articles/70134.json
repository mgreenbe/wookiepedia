The academy in turn, was an affiliate of the Jedi Service Corps' Exploration Corps branch. Traveling out into the galaxy and uncover ancient artifacts, the archaeologists would turn over all findings to the Educational Corps for deciphering and translation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a specialized field, there weren't a large number of archaeologists active at one time. During the Great Sith War, the Jedi Exar Kun, who was in the process of being seduced to the dark side, told Master Arca Jeth when he arrived on Onderon, that was connected with the academy. Kun asked for access to the tomb of King Ommin, a dark side practitioner. Having no reason to deny the young Jedi, Jeth unknowingly helped Kun gain access to dark side artifacts that would further his progress down the path to the dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several millennia later, the Human Jedi Knight Jocasta Nu would work with the ExplorCorps as an archaeologist, discovering much on her journey that would eventually lead to her appointment as Chief Librarian of the Jedi Archives on Coruscant.
