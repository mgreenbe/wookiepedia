It depicted two Imperial officers, one of whom resembled the artist herself, while the other was modeled on Captain Edmos Khurgee. Because Lyros used to choose her models from people who already shared a good relationship with COMPNOR, rumors started that she and Khurgee were romantically involved. The poster featured a yellow and red background with the words \"Loyal? Prove It!\" at the top and the words on the bottom reading \"Join COMPNOR Today!\" with the smaller print below giving the full name for COMPNOR, all written in High Galactic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "COMPNOR Recruitment is an in-universe artwork in the canon art book Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy.
