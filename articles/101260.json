The Force fueled all Rakatan technology, and the Empire accordingly sought out and enslaved worlds whose populations were strong in the Force through the use of Force-sensitives known as Force Hounds. In 25,793 BBY, Ore'mun served the Infinite Empire as a spy for Predor Skal'nas, a Rakatan overlord. Skal'nas dispatched Ore'mun to accompany the subordinate yet ambitious Predor Tul'kar on a conquest of the planet Tatooine, which had been discovered by Tul'kar's Force Hound Xesh."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The starships of the Infinite Empire arrived at the lush world, and Rakatan warriors subjugated the native Kumumgah. On the outskirts of a burning city, Ore'mun watched as Xesh identified Force-sensitives among the locals; the spy then received new orders transmitted from Skal'nas. Ore'mun complimented Tul'kar on Xesh's abilities in such a way as to point out that Skal'nas was his superior, and then confidently relayed the orders: Tul'kar had been summoned to meet with Skal'nas on the planet Byss, and Ore'mun was to remain on Tatooine to oversee the culling of local Force-sensitives. Furious with the display of smugness, Tul'kar telekinetically choked Ore'mun and killed the spy with Force lightning. Ore'mun's body was then prepared by Tul'kar's minions so the Predor could eat his conquered foe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a Rakatan, Ore'mun was sensitive to the Force.

The spy took pleasure in relaying Skal'nas's order that Tul'kar return to Byss, and took care to remind the Predor that he was Skal'nas's inferior.
