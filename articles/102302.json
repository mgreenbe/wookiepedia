The character was designed by John Mollo, and his mask was sculpted by Stuart Freeborn for shooting in England. The only difference between the two Lutrillian costumes was an ascot worn by one of the actors; the crew referred to at least one of these characters as the Colonel, and at least one as the Hare Mouse. Lucasfilm personnel dubbed one of the characters as Ownellco when Kenner asked for official names for the cantina denizens. The article \"Cantina Roll-Call: Shedding Light on Some Alien Aliases\" conflates these two Lutrillians as the same, leaving it unclear which Lutrillian was due to be named Ownellco. However, \"Rogues Gallery: The Usual Suspects: Who's Who in Mos Eisley\" indicates that Ownellco is the one with the ascot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ownellco is scantly visible in A New Hope and receives little screen time. He is visible speaking to the Qiraash female Leesub Sirln. One of the Lutrillians is later visible walking the streets of Mos Eisley.
