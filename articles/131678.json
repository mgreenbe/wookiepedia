Spinner also tried to assassinate Grand Lord Varner Hilts but was thwarted by his daughter Sith princess Takara Hilts who apprehended him. While Spinner faced the death penalty, Grand Lord Hilts decided to spare the life of the youth and gave him a second chance, sensing the youth's Force talents.

After the ship lands on Eshkrene, the pair attempt to desert Chegg's crew but are pursued by Chegg and his crew, who are intent on killing them. They were however saved by a group of cloaked strangers known as the Doomed, who promptly killed Chegg and the other pursuers with arrows.

Dreypa's rebel army marched into the Marisota Floodplain and fought with the Lost Tribe's forces, under the command of Lord Hilt's wife Grand Consort Iliana Hilts.

Aware of Spinner's new-found love for Takara, he threatened to kill Takara unless Spinner handed the Last Hope over to him.

Dreypa claimed ownership of the vessel only to discover that Spinner had set its engines for a one-way journey into Sessal Spire.
