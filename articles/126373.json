Despite a skirmish at the spaceport and attacks on the Vratix by Isard's troops, Sixtus was able to create a formidable resistance force. Sixtus helped capture and humiliate Erisi Dlarit's father. As the Rogues and their allies engaged Isard's flagship Lusankya over Thyferra, Sixtus and the insurgents attacked Isard's headquarters, eventually capturing Fliry Vorru, although Isard escaped in a shuttle.
