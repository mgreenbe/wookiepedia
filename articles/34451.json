Though data claimed that the planet contained no settlements or installations, the Galactic Empire maintained a secret military base within a mountain on Daro in the time shortly after the regime's formation, where troopers were recruited as part of Project War-Mantle. One of the clone trooper instructors, Gregor, attempted to desert from the facility on Daro and was captured, but not before sending a signal to fellow clone deserter Rex, who dispatched the unit of former clone commandos known as the Bad Batch to rescue Gregor. The Bad Batch managed to break Gregor out of imprisonment, but the leader of the unit, Hunter, failed to escape the base and was taken prisoner."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
