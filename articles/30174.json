Cormun was familiar with the pirate activities of Dharus. When Dharus posted in the Datalog about his predilection for FX-series medical assistant droids, Cormun replied to his post with information about Dharus and suggesting smugglers to make a profit selling him droid parts. A couple of years later, Cormun commented on the entry for the 850.AA Public Service Headquarters, passing on information that a Bothan clan reprogrammed one of the droids on Kothlis. As it passed by the home of a rival faction, the 850.AA deployed assassin droids to attack their enemies. Cormun was corrected by a fellow commenter, Sei'lya, who was present during the event. The 850.AA disgorged Arakyd Industries Seekers that slammed into the building's defenses and exploded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
