Although Valorum was removed from office by a Vote of No Confidence, Amedda retained his position under Palpatine, the senator of Naboo who was elected as the new Supreme Chancellor. He served as one of Palpatine's advisors during the Separatist Crisis; when Amedda recommended giving emergency powers to the Chancellor, Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks successfully proposed the motion to the Senate, allowing Palpatine to organize legions of clone troopers from Kamino into the Grand Army of the Republic in 22 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amedda continued to serve in the Office of the Chancellor during the Clone Wars, supporting Palpatine's decisions as a wartime leader.

Amedda retained his power in the New Order, serving as Grand Vizier in the Imperial Ruling Council. After the Emperor was killed in 4 ABY, Amedda was forced to serve as a figurehead for Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax, the self-styled Counselor to the Empire. Following the Battle of Jakku in 5 ABY, Amedda surrendered the Empire to the New Republic by signing the Galactic Concordance.

Criticisms about the unresponsiveness of the Republic and pervasive corruption in congress plagued the Valorum administration in this era, and Amedda became embroiled in widespread rumors that he was on the payroll of the Trade Federation. The Neimoidian-run megacorporation had become a significant economic and political force in the Republic over its years of operation and enjoyed both unprecedented representation within the Senate as well as near-complete control of shipping and commerce in the Outer Rim Territories.

Together, Palpatine and Amidala presented an impassioned plea for relief from the Trade Federation's predations, but were interrupted and accused of slander by the Federation's representative, Lott Dod. Dod called for a commission to be formed to verify the Naboo's claims and was seconded by Aks Moe of the Congress of Malastare. In spite of his desire to provide relief, Valorum reluctantly deferred to Amedda's procedural advice and sustained the objection, asking that Amidala defer her motion to allow for a commission to be established. On Palpatine's advice, Amidala declined and responded to the chancellor's apparent indecisiveness by calling for a Vote of No Confidence in Valorum's leadership\u2014a motion that proved overwhelmingly popular when the chamber broke out into calls to vote immediately, drowning out Amedda's calls for order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The motion from the Naboo delegation was successful and Valorum was removed from office.

As talk of secession grew and the Senate and bureaucracy became increasingly ineffective, the administration publicly appeared to be earnestly struggling to hold the Republic together. In truth, Palpatine was stoking the potential for war through the ex-Jedi firebrand Count Dooku, who had become a much-admired proponent of separatism on disaffected worlds.

The revelations shook the Jedi and Senate, but allowed Amedda to insist that Palpatine be granted emergency powers to handle the crisis. In an attempt to manipulate the Naboo Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks into proposing an emergency powers amendment, Amedda suggested that Senator Amidala would have made the proposal were she available.

All members of the group were subject to the Official Secrets Oath which protected their work from the Jedi and much of the Senate.

Upon its arrival on the capital, Amedda joined the Supreme Chancellor and Doctor Sionver Boll to witness the beast's transfer to a research facility in the Republic Science and Technical Center. The chancellor hoped to study and replicate the monster's armor for use in the Grand Army, but Doctor Boll admitted it would be impossible to do so without removing the scales from the beast.

Amedda was largely dismissive of Amidala's concerns, but he and the chancellor were able to convince Skywalker that the decision to kill the Zillo Beast was in the best interest of the war effort. During the meeting, Amedda received word from Doctor Boll that she had managed to synthesize Malastarian fuel into a toxic gas that could hypothetically kill the monster. Palpatine gave the order to execute the beast, but the endeavor was unsuccessful; the Zillo became agitated by the gas and broke free from the Science and Technical Center to rampage across the Coruscant cityscape.

Although the ambitious plans were allegedly created by the Separatists on Geonosis before falling into Republic hands, the captured Geonosian Archduke Poggle the Lesser insisted that the Confederacy was not building the station. Nevertheless, the Republic intelligence community disagreed, allowing Palpatine and Amedda to use the threat of a Confederate battle platform to secure funding and launch the development of the planet-killer superweapon for the Republic using the same design.

Krennic was eager to impress the Vice Chair and exert greater influence over the project, and so suggested to Amedda that his team required the participation of Galen Erso, a noted polymath and academic authority on energy enhancement. Although Amedda was skeptical, Krennic explained that Erso had been under the employ of Zerpen Industries and nearing a breakthrough in kyber crystal energy output. Erso had been captured months prior when Separatist proxies staged a coup on Vallt, accusing the scientist of espionage. The Vice Chair was inclined to dismiss the importance of an anti-war neutralist researcher, but Krennic convinced him that if the Republic did not rescue and recruit Erso, the Confederacy would coerce him into service.

Speaking from the podium, Amedda dismissed her claims as unreasonable idealism, but Kryze held firm. Ultimately, Palpatine and Amedda won the debate when they presented to the Senate a prerecorded holographic testimony from the late Mandalorian Deputy Minister Jerec. Although Jerec was an ally of the Duchess, his testimony\u2014which had been doctored as part Sidious's scheme to drag Mandalore into the war\u2014claimed that the Republic military needed to intervene as Kryze was unwilling to admit that her pacifist crusade had failed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The vote on the resolution to invade Mandalore was scheduled for the following day, but after an attempt on Kryze's life, Amedda and Palpatine advanced it to that evening.

Amedda confronted the Lieutenant Commander after a Strategic Advisory Cell briefing, demanding to know who authorized him to launch an attack on Vallt. Krennic explained that the sector admiral had given the green light in accordance with a deal struck with the neutralist Zerpin Industries. The Vice Chair conceded that the recapture of Vallt was of strategic benefit to the Republic, but still scolded Krennic for neglecting the chain of command, meeting with the Geonosian archduke, and failing to recruit Erso into the project. To Amedda's surprise, Krennic had levied the meeting with Poggle into an arrangement wherein the Geonosian would be returned to his homeworld in exchange for his people serving as a labor force in the orbiting Death Star construction site.
