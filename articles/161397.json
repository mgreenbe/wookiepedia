Goto did not seem to care much for the Exchange; he was only interested in numbers, progress reports, and stability. Eventually, Visquis entered a deal with Vogga the Hutt, who was annoyed by Goto stealing his freighters and disrupting his business on Nar Shaddaa, and received Vogga's best bounty hunter, Hanharr, at his disposal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Visquis decided to use the bounty G0-T0 had placed on Jedi against him\u2014he planned to capture a living Jedi and bring him before Goto; so far, the mysterious authority had only presented himself as a hologram, but for a Jedi, as Visquis hoped, he would make an exception, giving bounty hunters an opportunity to assassinate him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Knowing that the Jedi appeared whenever there were oppressors and oppressed people, he ordered Saquesh\u2014his representative in the Refugee Sector of Nar Shaddaa, also a Quarren\u2014to start driving the refugees away.

Some time had passed before another Jedi, Meetra Surik, appeared on the Smugglers' Moon and drove Saquesh and the Exchange out of the Refugee Sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Surik then received a message from Visquis, who said he had arranged an audience in his personal lounge. Even though Surik was aware that it was a trap, she decided to walk into it, as she and Kreia knew that sometimes traps worked both ways. However, on her way to the Jekk'Jekk Tarr, she was intercepted by Mira, who had been employed by Zez-Kai Ell to watch over Surik. She stole her enviro-suit and entered the bar herself, hoping to reach a peaceful agreement\u2014but her efforts proved to be for nothing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After that, Surik entered the Jekk'Jekk Tarr herself, using the breath control Force power to survive in its toxic atmosphere, and single-handedly laid down Visquis's thugs who tried to stop her.

He brought her to an arena in his hideout and suspected her to become easy prey for Hanharr, but she proved to be tough to kill.

One of the bounty hunters then impaled Visquis with a vibro double-blade, killing him instantly, despite Surik's protest. After his death, they incapacitated Surik, and delivered her to G0-T0's yacht."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The underground citadel in the Jekk'Jekk Tarr was planned to belong to the GenoHaradan, but, when they were cut from the game, was reassigned to Visquis[source?]\u2014similar to how Lonna Vash and one of the protocol droids in Vogga's warehouse were reassigned from the planet M4-78.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
