The creator of Star Wars, he executive-produced its original trilogy and the prequel trilogy. Close friends with fellow filmmakers Steven Spielberg and Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas worked on the Indiana Jones franchise with Spielberg after meeting him through his own directoral debut, THX 1138, and the films The Rain People and Apocalypse Now, directed by Coppola. With the latter's backing, Lucas made American Graffiti, and subsequently relied on its success to create Star Wars. Although it suffered significant setbacks and failed to achieve what Lucas wanted, the film was an immense success. George Lucas thus continued to tell his mythology, producing the third saga film in 1983."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Lucas was then divorced by his wife, Marcia, and was left with a three-year-old daughter. Lucas thus decided to prioritize raising his family, leaving his company, Lucasfilm Ltd., to manage the popular Star Wars franchise. In the 1980s, filming technology developed under Lucasfilm's Industrial Light & Magic division, whose employee John Knoll co-created Photoshop and whose computer division spawned EditDroid and Avid and developed into Pixar. George Lucas also became close acquaintances with mythologist Joseph Campbell, often speaking with his \"Yoda\" at Skywalker Ranch up until Campbell's death. In the 1990s, Lucas resumed active participation in the film industry, working on The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles and joining fellow film directors such as Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Clint Eastwood, and Stanley Kubrick alongside Spielberg, and Coppola on the Film Foundation's board of directors. Lucas also founded Edutopia, an education organization, and continued to push the boundaries of filmmaking technology to create the Special Editions. Faced with a decision to either go back to directing films that are more pure cinema and more visually-oriented and possibly never return to Star Wars, or to finish Star Wars by telling the backstory, which was never intended to be done, was not written as a movie, and yet was now a feasible project with new technology. From the late 1990s to 2005, Lucas returned with much of the film crew from The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles to complete the Star Wars saga with the prequel trilogy, where he would be able to tell the story of Darth Vader, as intended at first with the original trilogy, without any frustrations with technology."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After working on Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series with Dave Filoni, George Lucas desired to return to experimental films, and sold Lucasfilm to The Walt Disney Company in 2012 to prevent risking the company's financial standing and the livelihoods of his employees.

Through ILM, Lucas spurred the further development of computer graphics, film laser scanners, and the earliest use of 3D computer character animation in a film, Young Sherlock Holmes.

Addressing the universal question of \"am I a good person\" in the fundamental conflict between good and evil, George Lucas' Star Wars encompassed the core of all religions and spiritual beliefs from all time and space in the real world, being an \"easy to deal with\" metaphor for what humanity's beliefs are. The Force in Star Wars, an energy field that bound all life and reality together, is the essence of all religions in the real world, and originates from the first beliefs of humankind\u2014life force\u2014which flows through rocks and animals and brings humans to worship them. As Lucas explains, the belief in the Force\u2014in a thing that could explain the unknown that \"has some kind of power over us [humans] and/or that we have power over it\"\u2014stems from the psychological needs of humans that have been put together to in order to form a society."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Drawing from Lucas' interest in the psychological motifs that underlie the beliefs of the old, which is also known as mythology or \"psychological archaeology,\" as well as his interest in what connects all humans in their interpersonal relationships, Star Wars was constructed mainly from Buhddism and Methodism, the latter being the religion Lucas was brought up in. George Lucas also saw Methodism to be the same as Christianity, Islam, and Judaism\u2014their differences are simply artificial and ultimately superficial contructs; humans distorted their core belief in the Force into different religions for the sake of preserving the existence of their own society."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Crucially, George Lucas refined his modern fairy tale with the works of comparitive mythologist Joseph Campbell. After nearly dying in a car crash, George Lucas entered a period of self-reflection that led him to the discovery of Campbell. Subsequent to attending an anthropology class by Campbell in college and studying his works, Lucas became interested in mythology because through it, as a form of what he calls \"psychological archaeology,\" he could understand human actions and the psychological underpinnings of what people were thinking\u2014what they feared, what they felt about their parents\u2014their psyche. In studying Campbell, George Lucas made efforts to take the psychological motifs from mythology from across the world and condense them into Star Wars, with his films taking ideas that resonate through \"all societies\" and \"through all the ages\" as a result. With Joseph Campbell's seminal publication, The Hero with a Thousand Faces, Lucas incorporated archetypal characters and the monomyth structure to Star Wars in the aim of bringing the core of humanity to the fore of the modern world using a \"modern fairy tale\"\u2014his new form of mythology. Joseph Campbell later became a close acquaintance of Lucas' after the release of his first Star Wars films. and the filmmaker regarded the mythologist as his \"Yoda,\" his mentor figure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "George Lucas was also inspired by the mythology of his childhood, including the Western genre of films as well as Alex Raymond's Flash Gordon Saturday night television series. Akira Kurosawa's films, to which Lucas was exposed to in film school, served as key inspiration for the Star Wars films as well. The short film 21-87, a commentary on a machine-dominated society directed by Arthur Lipsett, inspired George Lucas to make the film THX-1138. 21-87 explores happiness and the relation of humans with reality, and was referenced in the form of Cell 21-87 in Lucas' first Star Wars film, A New Hope."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Teachings of Joseph Campbell"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mythology, as defined by Campbell, is humanity's metaphor for the transcendent; for eternity; for God\u2014a greater power ungraspable by humans. Referencing the Hindu trimurti Sadashiva sculpture of the Elephanta Caves, Campbell states that one enters a field of opposites whenever one moves out of the transcendent, that all things in the field of time is dual. The mythologist lists the opposites past and future, dead and alive, male and female, good and evil, and light and dark as examples of the dichotomous nature of reality as perceived by humanity. However, Joseph Campbell said that most humans put their minds on the side they saw as good, and that one of the problems of life is to live in the realization of the terms good and evil; for one to know the center and for one to know that the two dichotomous terms are simply temporal apparitions. Campbell saw that man's mythology is based on the inside of duality, leading to religions having a tendency to be ethical\u2014sin and atonement, right and wrong. The Bible draws a distinction between God and nature, pitting nature against man and differentiating man from God. The condemnation of nature, Campbell observed, originates from Zarathustra's time and is shared by Islam, yet it is not shared by Shinto, basic Hinduism, or Buddhism. Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche records his personal characterization of Zarathustra in his novel Thus Spoke Zarathustra, where he posits the \u00dcbermensch as a goal for humanity, the eternal recurrence through space and time\u2014which is echoed by the rhyming, recurring motifs in the course of events in Star Wars\u2014and criticizes the dichotomous morality of good and evil. The Japanese culture of being in harmony with nature fascinated Campbell, and acting on instinct and being one with one's instincts, with nature, with the present, with the Living Force, is taught by Jar Jar Binks and subsequently the Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn, as well as Jinn's students Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda. The protagonists of Star Wars and their associated locations are dressed in natural colors of green and brown, while the antagonists and their associated locations are dressed in the mechanical black and white, with hints of red that George Lucas associates with evil. Through color, Lucas thus created a rigid world of absolutes for the antagonists as opposed to the natural world the protagonists live in."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Love, life, and letting go"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "George Lucas explained one of the the core values of Star Wars, one of the problems of the struggle in Star Wars, is about passion against compassion; which is greed against giving and letting go. Compassion is defined by Lucas as joy, an everlasting emotion attained from being selfless\u2014the light side of the Force\u2014and is one of two components of happiness. Compassion is love, the core of all religions and spiritual traditions, and the Force is the amalgamation of the essence of all such beliefs. All humans have a compassionate side and a selfish side, asserts Lucas, and the main idea is to keep the two in balance by recognizing their coexistance, reject the dominance of selfishness, and be compassionate in order for a person to do good things. In the legal, financial, and political systems of the American society, Lucas sees that they are based on a flawed, \"winner-take-all\" culture that arose from a \"cave-man\" mentality. Instead, Lucas wants a society based on compassion, where every person in society is cared for and everything is done for the best of all of society. Anakin Skywalker lusted for power over all life and thus became evil in his greed\u2014inability to let go of the inevitable death of his lover. As said through Lucas' works, death is a natural part of life, and that which maintains the harmonious, symbiotic relationship between all life and reality\u2014the Force. Skywalker violates the natural order of the Force in choosing to pursue immortality, becoming consumed by his own hatred and selfishness, the dark side. The son, Luke Skywalker, later confronts the father, who pities the self-sacrifice of Luke in affirming his stance as a Jedi in service to the Force and the galaxy and atones for his sins by letting go of himself to fulfill the will of the Force and bring balance to it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Filmography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Feature films"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Television"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Published works"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lucas also served as a producer on the video game Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, and many Expanded Universe and fan productions have one form or another of the credit \"Special thanks to George Lucas.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances in Star Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to his cameo role as Baron Papanoida, Lucas has made two Expanded Universe appearances.
