As Rey escapes from the bandits they start to chase her across the desert. The bandits try to take her out, but Rey tricks the bandits and she's able to force the two of them to crash into each other's speeder bikes. After realizing that Teedo is the only one remaining, she comes up with a plan and tricks him into following her to the wreckage of an Imperial-class Star Destroyer. Once inside the wreckage, Rey's scheme goes exactly as planned and a nightwatcher worm attacks Teedo and eats his speeder. After seeing Teedo flee, Rey and BB-8 once again start on their path to Niima Outpost."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
