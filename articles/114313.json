After the conclusion of the war and the signing of the Treaty of Coruscant, the Republic found itself unable to rise out of the depression and was therefore hampered in its efforts to rebuild in the aftermath of the Great War. The depression continued throughout the Cold War and into the Galactic War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
