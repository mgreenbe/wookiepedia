The craft had a single purpose, to quickly and securely deliver its passengers to a planet's surface, and as such was designed to hurtle towards its target at a speed high enough to avoid engagement from enemy fighters as well as ground-defense weapons. The pods were marketed towards mercenary companies and were used by small warlords on the edge of the Unknown Regions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
