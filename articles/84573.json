It was typically wielded by riot or military police, or often used by security in particularly obstreperous areas, and was roughly the same height of a fully grown clone trooper with a curved sheet of reinforced plasteel that could be strapped to a single arm. The cost of the shield was 600 credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When used, the wielder was allowed to see through a narrow viewport that was set at the top of the shield, and as a result of its shape and its inherent strength of plasteel, the Bulwark could shrug off light blaster rifle fire, as well as shrapnel and splinters from grenades and other explosive devices."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The M3 Bulwark Blast Shield first appeared, albeit unidentified, in \"The Unknown,\" the first episode of the animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars' sixth season, which originally aired on February 15, 2014.
