The staff, when deactivated resembled a baton 50 centimeters in length. It could be activated only by first grabbing each half of the baton, twisting, then pulling them apart. A 10 centimeter long stun prod then sprang from each end of the staff, and two high-voltage power couplings would crackle to life in between the three pieces. Activated, the San-Ni tripled in length to 150 centimeters. The electrical discharge was powerful enough to shear off limbs, cook flesh, and even a near miss would give severe burns to an enemy, the wielder however seemed to be shielded from this, through the use of miniature heat sinks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The San-Ni staff was a versatile weapon. The wielder could protect himself from lightsaber blows by parrying them using the san-ni staff's power couplings, which were impervious to lightsaber damage. In addition, a wielder could choose to strike an opponent using the power couplings in order to deal non-lethal stunning damage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The San-Ni staff was used by the Jedi Master Waldan Bridger, a trait for which he was most known for in the Jedi Order.
