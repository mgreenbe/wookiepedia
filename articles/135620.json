The gorge contained a large number of waterfalls, which flowed even during winter when the pass iced over, although often just as a trickle. The young pilots Ciena Ree and Thane Kyrell often practiced flying Kyrell's V-171 starship through the pass, despite the challenge Stepson's Gorge posed to pilots at every turn. Five years after they had first met, the pair flew together into the pass during a winter afternoon and witnessed the formation of a rainbow as the light hit one of the waterfalls."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stepson's Gorge first appeared in the novel Lost Stars, which was written by Claudia Gray and released in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
