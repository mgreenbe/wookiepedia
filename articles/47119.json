The faction was part of a hierarchy of Force-sensitive factions that made up all of Bosph government and ruled over the planet. Each faction would take any Bosph found to be Force sensitive, known as ela b'Yentarr, at a young age and apprentice them to a member of the group, with each faction training their members in different aspects of the Force. The gamefinders specialized in Force powers which would aid them in hunting such as precognition and Force sense. Like most ela b'Yentarr many gamefinders were killed during the Imperial bombardment of Bosph. One farseer that survived the bombardment was a Bosph named Bora Boru who went on to take up a care as a smuggler using his force abilities. Farseers had unlimited access to the philosophical teachings of the Bosph and were also provided with their own glyph, which gave them the right to possess objects."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
