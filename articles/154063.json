During the reborn Emperor Palpatine's military campaign, launched by the Galactic Empire in an attempt to retake control of the galaxy in 10 ABY, the commander was stationed on the New Republic outpost on the planet Altyr V. He was assisted there by the Jedi Knight Kyle Katarn and his apprentice Mara Jade, the former Emperor's Hand-turned-Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One day, the Altyr 5 base's sensors detected two asteroids approaching the planet. Thinking that they would break up on contact, the commander was surprised when they took up a geosynchronous orbit and began bombarding the base's shields, revealing them to be some type of new Imperial weapons disguised as asteroids to take the base by surprise. Furthermore, the long-range sensors on Delta 3 picked up an Imperial strike force entering hyperspace. The main Imperial force\u2014which was large enough to destroy the entire base\u2014was estimated to reach Altyr 5 in three hours, and evacuation orders could not be issued because of the continuing fire from the asteroids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The commander immediately called the two Jedi, and briefed them on the situation, calmly coordinating the base's defenses afterward. The Jedi formulated a plan and separated; while Jade was to remain on the base, to help the commander in the coordination of Altyr 5's defenses against the Imperial forces sent from the asteroids, Katarn successfully infiltrated one of the asteroids using a stolen Imperial shuttle. Eventually, he destroyed both asteroids, which allowed the commander to evacuate the base before the enemy reinforcements emerged from hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Katarn, who had found a clue to the location of an ancient Sith Temple while on the asteroid, soon left for the planet Dromund Kaas to find it. With Katarn gone, the commander assigned Jade to a mission vital for the New Republic. He told Jade to contact the crime lord Ka'Pa the Hutt, in order to convince him to give the New Republic some desperately needed supplies, in exchange for amnesty for all his crimes. Although Jade was at first reluctant to accept the task, she agreed to it after the commander explained to her why the mission was so important."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The commander had light skin and gray hair, with facial hair styled in a full beard.

Additionally, in the Mysteries of the Sith game manual, he is named \"Rebel Commander\", despite the fact that the Rebel Alliance had already been re-formed into the New Republic by the time Mysteries of the Sith took place. The game manual also showed the Rebel Commander as an AI ally, even though he is shown only in cutscenes as a main character. His physical appearance is unique in the game. Furthermore, because of the nature of the word \"commander,\" it is unknown if it was his military rank, or if it was used as a term to address an officer holding a distinct unit command. The commander's unique command insignia with nine pips has also never been used in other Star Wars works and the rank it represents has never been identified so far."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
