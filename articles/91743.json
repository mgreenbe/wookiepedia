The Imperial spy Aleyna Hark had been seen near the mountain compound of the Alderaanian noble Duke Horis Thul, and, while the Knight rushed to the compound to prevent Thul's assassination, Din claimed that he would track down Nefarid and the Death Mark laser.

Wounded, the Jedi Master was brought before Angral on the ship's bridge, and the Sith Lord broadcast a transmission of the events on the bridge across the entire HoloNet.

Upon being presented with Din, with whom Angral had maintained a rivalry since the end of the Great Galactic War between the Republic and the Empire almost a decade earlier, the Sith Lord mocked his opponent's attempt and questioned whether Din was ready to die.
