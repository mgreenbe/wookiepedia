Born to a Human father and a Sephi mother, Hissa operated out of the Kessel system during the Galactic Civil War, becoming allies with Trioculus, a three-eyed slavelord. After Emperor Palpatine's death at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, Hissa founded the Central Committee of Grand Moffs, who installed Trioculus as their figurehead, claiming he was the son of Emperor Palpatine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The only person barring Trioculus's ascension to Emperor was Kadann, the Supreme Prophet of the Dark Side; gaining his dark blessing was integral to Hissa's scheme. Although Kadann initially gave Trioculus his dark blessing, he soon rescinded it, claiming the title of Emperor for himself. Trioculus was initially thought to have been killed by the Prophets, though he survived, and along with Hissa and the other Moffs began plotting as to how he would regain his throne. Trioculus, however, was killed by members of the Rebel Alliance, leaving Hissa and the Moffs to face the wrath of Kadann alone. The Supreme Prophet sentenced him to a slow and painful death, though before his execution could take place, Hissa was taken to the fourth moon of the planet Yavin, where Kadann was searching for the Lost City of the Jedi. Hissa was killed when Kadann sent him on a reconnaissance mission into a possible location of the city, which was in fact a decoy, filled with molten lava."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life and career"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Born to a Sephi mother and a Human father, Bertroff Hissa hailed from the barren, uncharted planet of PL-40112-CE-021105, located within the Wild Space region of the galaxy. His parents, a couple of former political agitators and counter-culturalists, had decided to migrate there in their quest for a \"simple and natural\" life. Because of his isolated upbringing, the young Hissa became something of a loner, not forming friendships easily. However, his life changed forever when he first encountered the Galactic Empire, a galaxy-wide autocratic government led by Emperor Palpatine. At that time, a delegation of Imperial surveyors came to the planet, led by Commander Quarsh Panaka, a Human from the world of Naboo. The offworlders inadvertently awakened a group of Rozzum, interdimensional creatures had been dropped there long ago by the Order of the Terrible Glare, a violent splinter group of the Jedi Order formed during the Pius Dea Crusades."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the Imperials came with many speciesist biases, the Rozzum were more horrifying than any other \"alien\" they had witnessed in their lives. In that situation, both the Imperials and the natives of PL-40112-CE-021105 joined forces to combat the monsters. Hissa and his parents were also conscripted into the ranks by order of Commander Panaka. The improvised alliance between the Empire and the near-Humans was triumphant, but only Hissa and Panaka survived the struggle. Following that victory, Hissa began a long and unlikely career within the Galactic Empire's ranks despite its xenophobic and Human supremacist nature. While in the Imperial Military, Hissa faced crushing prejudice for his near-Human status, although Panaka fought for the alien and supported him up until the latter's promotion to Moff of his native Chommell sector."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Grand Moff"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Hissa ended up promoted to Grand Moff, being one of the few aliens within the Empire to ever reach that rank. He likewise learned that most of his peers aboard the \"Moffship,\" especially Grand Admiral Rufaan Tigellinus, were xenophobic of aliens. The latter in particular claimed he was allergic to the even the merest whiff of alien blood. As such, Hissa's origins, due to his rarely discussing his past, were largely unknown, though his jaws made clear to the Imperials that he was of part-Human part-alien descent, with razor-sharp teeth and tapered ears, the former of which he had personally filed down specifically to intimidate others. Both due to his unusual features and his highly classified past, rumors also circulated that he either possessed Devaronian or Pau'an genetics, or otherwise was a Twi'lek who had lopped off his own brain tails. Hissa had not only encouraged these rumors, he in fact started them. He had a receding hairline, though his dark eyebrows were extremely bushy, and he had a thick beard on the end of his chin. Hissa was one of few non-Humans to work his way up through the ranks and achieve a powerful position in the Galactic Empire, eventually becoming the Grand Moff of a sector in the Outer Rim Territories, which included the planet Kessel, where Hissa operated from. He made several enemies during his time as Moff, among them Rufaan Tigellinus, who despised Hissa due to his alien origin, and sought to have him discredited. However, Hissa managed to keep his position, and was one of few Imperials to report directly to Emperor Palpatine. Hissa despised Tigellinus and his Humanocentric views in return."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his time on Kessel, Hissa learned of a three-eye slave Trioculus, who had managed to root out a Rebel cell in his village, and the young man's loyalty and dedication to the Imperial cause impressed the Grand Moff, becoming one of Hissa's friends. Trioculus rose to the rank of Lord Overseer and Supreme Slavelord of the Kessel spice mines, and when Reskell Twane, Trioculus's predecessor and the man who raised him as a youth, was captured by the Rybet Moruth Doole and offered to Trioculus in exchange for control of half of Kessel, Trioculus asked Hissa for advice. Hissa told Trioculus that a true Imperial never caved into threats, and Trioculus took his advice and refused Doole's offer. By the end of the Galactic Civil War, Hissa held considerable influence with the other Moffs, and was generally looked up to."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another close personal friend of Hissa's was Quorl Matrin, an Imperial governor who represented the Gordian Reach and shared Hissa's like of archaeology. Matrin referred to Hissa by his nickname, \"Troff,\" and often performed impersonations of his superiors, to Hissa's amusement. The two kept in contact even when Matrin was away, such as when he went to the planet Stenos to study the Stenax species. Matrin intended to keep Hissa up to date during his expedition, including his difficulty getting the attention of natives, though their relationship ended soon after the trip began, as Quorl was ripped to pieces by the Stenax."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Struggle for power"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, Emperor Palpatine and his enforcer, Darth Vader, were killed in the Battle of Endor, leaving a massive power vacuum in the ranks of the Empire. Many successors to Palpatine were put forward, with former Director of Imperial Intelligence Ysanne Isard eventually gaining the backing of most of the remnants of Palpatine's Empire. Hissa and many of his fellow Moffs, however, sought to retain their power, and formed the Central Committee of Grand Moffs in an attempt to steal power from Isard, with Hissa being made the Committee's leader. Stationed on their own Moffship, the Committee included such senior Moffs as Muzzer, Thistleborn and Dunhausen. Hissa's former enemy, Rufaan Tigellinus, was one whom many saw as a potential leader in place of Hissa; in response to this threat, Hissa presented Tigellinus with a demeaning offer\u2014a place on the Committee\u2014knowing the man would be executed if he refused. Tigellinus's friend, Moff Vilim Disra, manipulated him, telling him to refuse. When he did so, Hissa and his fellow Committee members reacted with fury and had him killed, while Disra took his seat and the majority of his assets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While many Imperials sided with the Committee of Grand Moffs, the majority remained loyal to Isard. The Moffs knew of the existence of an heir to Palpatine's throne: his three-eyed son, Triclops, whom he had rejected and banished to the spice mines of Kessel. Many rumors surrounded Triclops, and Hissa and his fellow Moffs knew that if they had him as a figurehead, they would gain the support of much of the Imperial forces, and would be able to overthrow Isard and claim rule of the galaxy. There were, however, many complexities about installing Triclops as the new Emperor; the three-eyed man was thought to be insane, and Hissa knew he would slowly destroy the Empire. Thus, Hissa kept Triclops's existence secret, and brought Trioculus, his old ally from Kessel, into the fray."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another three-eyed mutant, Trioculus was a far more suitable Emperor in the Committee's minds; he lusted for power, and the Moffs knew that if they made him the public leader and showed unswerving loyalty towards him, he would allow them to make his decisions. If Trioculus was put forward as a candidate, it would allow the committee true power, and the man would arouse little suspicion by claiming to be Palpatine's son. They also fitted him with implants, which could give the illusion of Force lightning, further evidence that Trioculus was Palpatine's son. However, the Prophets of the Dark Side, led by an impostor of Supreme Prophet Kadann, had made a false prophecy, stating that the new Emperor would wear the glove of Darth Vader, which had reportedly survived the destruction of the second Death Star above Endor. The prophets held considerable influence during Palpatine's reign, so, although they recognized Trioculus as the new Emperor, Hissa and the Moffs decided to search for the glove, hoping to receive Kadann's dark blessing."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Meeting on Kessel"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hissa and his companions called an Imperial meeting at Kessendra Stadium on Kessel, where they unveiled the new Emperor in front of dozens of high-ranking Imperials. Hissa greeted the large audience, which was made up of many individuals of varying Imperial ranks. He told them that the Emperor's death, Vader's death, and the destruction of the Death Star were nothing but minor setbacks; the Rebels had yet to see their true power and might, and with new weapons on the horizon, Hissa's Empire would destroy the Rebel Alliance and rule the galaxy. To the attendees' great surprise, Hissa announced that Palpatine's line continued, and presented to them Trioculus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Immediately, however, people began to question Trioculus's right to rule. An Imperial Royal Guard told them that Admiral Josef Grunger had proclaimed himself the new leader of the Empire, though Hissa and Trioculus were unfazed, with the three-eyed slavelord telling the congregation that he would soon deal with Grunger. Another questioned Trioculus, noting that he did not possess the glove of Darth Vader, and thus could not have received Kadann's blessing. Furious at their doubt, Trioculus used his implants to electrocute them, instantly gaining the fear and respect of many other members at the meeting. With many admirals and Moffs pledging their allegiance to Trioculus and the Central Committee of Grand Moffs, Hissa and the mutant departed the stadium, triumphant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although many now recognized Trioculus as Emperor, Hissa was left with a difficult situation. Receiving Kadann's blessing would gain them many supporters, and the Prophets themselves would be powerful allies to have. Yet should another find the glove and present it to the Supreme Prophet, then the Committee would lose their power and credibility. Hissa was determined not to let that happen, and knew that he must find the glove before anyone else did. It was, though, a difficult task. They had probe droids search the Moddell sector, while every Imperial loyal to Hissa was on the lookout for the glove."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While their agents were working non-stop in the search for Vader's glove, Hissa and the other Moffs met with Trioculus in his mansion on Kessel. The mutant wanted a new secret base of operations, and asked the Committee for their input. This experience was new to them, as neither Vader nor Palpatine had cared for their opinions. After several suggestions, Hissa stumbled onto something Trioculus supported: Hoth, where the Empire had defeated the Rebel Alliance two years earlier. As they ordered every warlord and admiral loyal to them to take their troops to Hoth, Grand Admiral Miltin Takel, in a spice-induced haze, told Trioculus he was acting hastily. Trioculus stunned Takel, while Hissa executed his superior's unspoken order, shooting Takel with his side-arm."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The elusive glove"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several days passed, and the glove had yet to be located. Hissa and Trioculus were growing worried\u2014the only reported sighting was in fact a droid hand, something that was of little use to the two males. Finally, they discovered the location of the glove: Mon Calamari, the ocean planet of the Mon Calamari species. Captain Dunwell had been sent by the Empire to hunt the local Whaladons, who were considered a delicacy by the Committee. Dunwell had discovered what he thought was wreckage from the Death Star, and had seen a glove through his team's x-ray surveys. Hissa and Trioculus traveled to Calamari immediately, where Dunwell showed them the x-rays. Although the Death Star exploded on the other side of the galaxy from Calamari, the debris had passed through a black hole, and found itself on the ocean floors of Calamari. After convincing them it was the glove, Dunwell transported them to the wreckage in his Whaladon-hunting submarine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They eventually reached the wreckage, and Trioculus retrieved the glove alone, while Hissa remained with Dunwell in the submarine. Trioculus soon returned, and the glove fit his hand perfectly. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker and Admiral Gial Ackbar had traveled to Calamari in an attempt to free the Whaladons, and had spotted Trioculus on board Dunwell's submarine. The Jedi's submarine was captured by Dunwell's vessel, though Skywalker managed to infiltrate it and set it to self-destruct. Trioculus and Skywalker fought, though Skywalker's Jedi powers proved too strong for Trioculus; Luke subdued him, before fleeing the ship. With just two minutes left on the countdown, Hissa and Trioculus fled in an escape sub, leaving Dunwell behind\u2014he had been spying on them, and learned that Trioculus was not who he said he was. They eventually escaped and, although they almost perished and were forced to leave Dunwell to die, the mission was ultimately successful, as they had recovered the glove."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the glove now successfully secured, Hissa and Trioculus journeyed to the space station Scardia in the Null Zone, to gain Kadann's dark blessing and acceptance of Trioculus as the rightful heir to the throne of the late Palpatine. In truth Kadann was an impostor, and was incapable of making a single prophecy\u2014he got his information from a series of spy networks, and often made sure his prophecies came true, happily resorting to bribery, sabotage and treachery to do so."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Lost City of the Jedi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They met with High Prophet Jedgar, who led them to Kadann. Hissa announced that Trioculus was Palpatine's son, though Kadann saw through the lie. The Grand Moff and his friend conferred together; Hissa knew of Kadann's network of spies, and told Trioculus that the man knew everything and thus could not be deceived. At Hissa's urging, Trioculus agreed to reveal their secrets and plans to Kadann, knowing that any attempts at deception would not be successful. They told Kadann everything, including Hissa's reasons behind installing Trioculus as the Emperor. Kadann understood, and was not angry at them for lying to him; they showed him the glove and asked for his blessing, though the Prophet had yet another vague prophecy. He told them that there was a Jedi Prince in the Lost City of the Jedi on Yavin 4 that could destroy him. Trioculus vowed to track down and kill this Jedi Prince, and Kadann gave him his dark blessing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hissa and Trioculus were tasked with a difficult objective. Although Kadann had given them a vague pointer as to where the city was situated, it would take days to find it, and the supreme prophet suggested they find the Jedi Prince as soon as possible. Together, the two men formulated a plan: they would issue the Senate Planetary Intelligence Network an ultimatum so terrible that the Rebels would have to give them the location of the city, which Trioculus was sure they would know. They sent masses of probe droids to the moon, locating SPIN's base of operations. Having done so, they sent a droid, armed with a self-destruct mechanism, into the Rebels' meeting place, with such leaders as Mon Mothma, Ackbar, Leia Organa, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo present. Hissa and Trioculus watched the proceedings in orbit, through minute cameras installed on the droid. They witnessed the Rebels attempting to destroy the droid, which evaded their every move. After several moments watching the pandemonium in the Rebel chambers, Trioculus made a statement to SPIN, telling them that unless they told him the location of the Lost City of the Jedi within twenty seconds, the droid would detonate, killing them all. In truth, neither Skywalker nor the others knew where the city lay, so they desperately tried to destroy the droid before it could destroy them. Trioculus's plans were foiled, however, when Skywalker destroyed the droid with his lightsaber. Trioculus was unfazed, though; he and Hissa had a back-up plan, and he had found his \"future wife,\" Leia Organa, whom he had instantly fallen in love with."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hissa had hundreds of Imperial vehicles burn down the forests of Yavin 4, which were barring them from locating the \"round wall of green marble\" that Kadann had described. It would, however, have unforeseen consequences for Trioculus and his allies. Although he had kept quiet about it previously, Vader's glove was having detrimental effects on the mutant's health. His eyesight had slowly deteriorated until he was unable to see, and Hissa searched for a cure. The Empire had captured a Ho'Din healer named Baji during their purges of the forests, and brought him before Hissa and Trioculus, hoping he would be able to cure their leader's eyesight. The Ho'Din provided them with a temporary cure of kibo seeds, though his stock was running low, and the Empire was currently burning down the rest of the kibo plants. Desperate, Hissa's master climbed into Baji's home to snatch the remainder of the seeds, though he returned with heavy burns to the skin.

Hissa even pinned up advertising for the bounty onto walls personally, and was doing so in the Mos Eisley cantina when Zorba Desilijic Tiure returned from his lengthy prison sentence on the planet Kip, searching for his son Jabba. Hissa told him what had happened, that Princess Leia Organa had strangled him during the Battle of the Great Pit of Carkoon one year previously.

He showed Hissa just one page, and the Humanoid swore an oath of allegiance to Kadann. Jedgar had the block of carbonite transferred to his ship, and had Hissa accompany him on a mission to the planet Duro.

Noticing Ken, Jedgar ordered Hissa to take the boy hostage; the Grand Moff did so, forcing Luke Skywalker to halt his attack. Skywalker dropped his weapon at Hissa's demand, though Triclops, who had joined the Rebels, used his third eye to conjure a strong magnetic force, which pulled Ken away from Hissa. Triclops then approached Hissa, hoping to take his revenge for the Moff's part in having him locked up.
