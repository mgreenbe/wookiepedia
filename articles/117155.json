The flatbread was used to contain the fillings of sandwiches such as Ronto Wraps and Ronto Morning Wraps. Ronto wrappers were suitable for humans to consume."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Takodana in 34 ABY, Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs published his cookbook which included a recipe for ronto wrappers and an approximation of Bakkar's ronto wraps. Tuggs described the flatbread as simple but versatile, flexible and durable enough that fillings would not turn the wrapper soggy, and would not overpower the fillings like some breads. He recommended dipping it into gravy or hummus, such as the one in his Felucian Garden Spread, which he provided his recipe for in his cookbook and served at his mobile restaurant, Tuggs' Grub."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ronto wraps, the first dish that used ronto wrappers, were announced on February 27, 2019 as part of a large press release on upcoming dining offerings for the Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge theme park.
