Pythar-class shuttles were small vessels with short, curved wings on either side. A Pythar-class shuttlecraft named the Deference was utilized by an Imperial scientist during the war when he performed upgrades on the personal space station of the Sith Emperor. The Deference was shot down in the Battle of Hoth in 3665 BBY, and the shuttle later became the target of a Jedi mission to retrieve the plans for the Emperor's space station stored within the ship's computers. By the time of the Galactic War between the Republic and the Empire, another Pythar-class shuttlecraft had crashed in the Icehang Loop, a section of Hoth's Highmount Ridge region."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Pythar-class shuttlecraft was first mentioned by the Jedi Leeha Narezz in the Jedi Knight class mission \"Sub-Zero Showdown\" in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare and LucasArts in 2011, where locating the shuttle Deference is the objective of the player's mission.
