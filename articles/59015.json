Separate from the Chamber of Antiquities, which held the most valuable treasures of the Library, the Hall contained a wide array of knowledge from simple Old Republic star and planet logs to ancient Jedi texts on hundreds of thousands of datacards. Philosophical treatises, galactic history, and lore were housed here in a variety of formats. When the Cron Supernova obliterated all life on the planet, the Hall of Knowledge was left in ruin, preserved forever in the state of a tomb as it slowly succumbed to the ravages of time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
