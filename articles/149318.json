To that end, Kenobi visited Trigalis, where he had arranged to meet with Secura in New Coronet, having been previously instructed by Grand Master Yoda not to allow his own mission to interfere with that of Secura."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Kenobi was still away from the city, a green-skinned swooper noticed the Jedi using his lightsaber. The swooper, together with seven other swoop-mounted thugs who were all intent on confiscating Kenobi's possessions, proceeded to pursue him through a stretch of Trigalis's swamps, peppering their quarry with blasterfire. Kenobi, who was wearing a mask and was also riding a swoop, crippled six of the pursuers' repulsorcraft, including one that he destroyed with a thrown explosive. Heading for New Coronet, Kenobi disposed of another pursuer when the latter crashed his swoop in a bridge on the settlement's outskirts.

Finally, Kenobi confronted Xist and requested the enforcer give information to him. In response, the Falleen drew his vibrowhip, leading the two to engage in a vicious duel.

When he was finally defeated, the Black Sun leader agreed to reveal to the Jedi what little he knew about Ventress's survival."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xist then invited Kenobi to another room of the fortress and told the Jedi that he could not confirm the veracity of rumors about Ventress's survival. The Falleen did, however, know that the Confederate leader, Count Dooku, had sent one of his best agents to assassinate Xist's rival, the arms dealer Drama Korr. Xist also told Kenobi that the hit on Korr would occur when the merchant arrived at the Karthakk sector world of Maramere in a few days' time. In truth, the enforcer had intentionally provided misleading information to Kenobi, as the agent assigned to kill Korr was the bounty hunter Durge, not Ventress, as Kenobi assumed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The following day, Kenobi contacted the Jedi High Council on the planet Coruscant via hologram.

Unfortunately for Ratua Dil, he was promptly arrested by local authorities, who assumed he was also a pirate. Since the judges presiding over the Zelosian's case were convinced he was guilty of at least some criminal transgressions, if not the original accusation of piracy, he was sentenced to imprisonment on the Atrivis sector prison planet Despayre."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The population of the Trigalis system around 25 ABY was between 10 million to 100 million.

Nevertheless, many travel guides continued to designate the city as a trading post."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, New Coronet was controlled by the Black Sun leader Xist from a heavily guarded stone fortress located inside the city. The compound featured a central tower; a room that had one wall lined with several different bladed weapons, firearms, and various trophy skulls; and a room with a balcony and a large stone table. In the last of these rooms, a pair of wheeled servant droids was present and catered to Xist and Obi-Wan Kenobi during their conversation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trigalis first appeared in the first issue of the Star Wars: Obsession comic series.
