Archaic horns owed their name to the hard outgrowths found in pairs on the heads of certain creatures, in which they were carved. In some cultures, such as the Mon Calamari of Dac, horns were made out of large seashells. Other types of horns were made of wood or sheets of metal. Known variants of horns comprized the Xloff, Plandl, Faln, Woot, and Flagn horns."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
