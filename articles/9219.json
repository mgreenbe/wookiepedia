Kuiil led Djarin to the mercenary encampment on blurrg mounts and left the Mandalorian to capture the asset on his own.

The Ugnaught Kuiil arrived on a blurrg mount and rescued Djarin, taking him to his moisture farm, where he offered to assist the Mandalorian in locating his bounty.

While observing the Nikto mercenaries in the camp, Djarin noticed an IG-series assassin droid entering the base and demanding the asset be released, citing the Bondsman Guild Protocol. The assassin droid, designated IG-11, was immediately attacked, though he killed many of the mercenaries, sending the rest into hiding within the camp's buildings. Djarin approached IG-11, and the droid initially perceived him as a threat.

The Jawas drove the bounty hunter to a nearby mudhorn cave where he confronted the beast.

Image Engine was responsible for developing several establishing shots that documented Djarin and Kuiil's journey through the rain to the Jawa camp, as well as working on a sandcrawler render from Industrial Light & Magic and the bargaining scenes at the camp. Backdrops on Arvala-7 were created using 360-degree LED display monitors, which allowed for interactive backdrop assets to be rendered and displayed in real time. When the light from the LEDs was not enough to simulate real daylight, the team performed heavy grading on props to make them blend with the backdrop. Whenever the real-time background looked out of place, the LED volume was replaced entirely with a computer-generated backdrop. To accomplish this, Image Engine ingested the real-time assets from ILM, uprezzed them in lookdev and texture, made sure cameras lined up properly, and then handed the asset over to the environments department."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
