FR-D was aboard a New Republic warship that had been stolen by mercenaries hired by Domina Tagge to collect durasteel for retrieval of the Great Life Jewels. The remains of the cyborg bounty hunter Beilert Valance were brought onto the ship, reactivating from stasis. Valance killed the crew of the ship, but spared FR-D, learning of the crew's quest for the Great Life Jewels. FR-D and Valance traveled to the Unknown Regions, where the jewels were held aboard a drifting Imperial-class Star Destroyer. Valance acquired the jewels from the New Republic team sent to contain the Crimson Forever plague, but was shot by Tagge before he could restore himself to life. FR-D overloaded its power core, sacrificing itself to revive Valance's cyborg body in the hope that the bounty hunter could in turn save the others aboard the Star Destroyer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
