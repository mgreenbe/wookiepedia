Each of the plant's tentacles was black in color with bioluminescent ridges along one side. The ridges could be pink or red in color, and sometimes faded to gray before lighting up again. The plant grew amongst forests of Zabrak Spines and could grow far larger than a human. It was a particularly aggressive plant, and few had escaped the embrace of its tendrils."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Death's Embrace first appeared in \"Darkness on Umbara,\" the seventh episode of Star Wars: The Clone Wars Season Four, which aired on October 28, 2011.
