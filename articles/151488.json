Its main weapon was a large rotating electromagnetic plasma cannon located on its head designed to desintegrate entire platoons of enemy soldiers. It was also equipped with twin antipersonnel laser cannons. Like the Umbaran starfighter, the controls for the MHC tank were activated by hand motions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The MHC tanks were used during the Battle of Umbara, a conflict that occurred during the Clone Wars between the Grand Army of the Republic and the Umbaran militia, which had sided with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. At least three active tanks were guarding the Umbaran airbase that was later captured by the 501st."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the 501st Legion of clone troopers advanced over the shadowy surface of Umbara, they encountered two MHC tanks. The clone troopers realized that the tanks' armor was impervious to heavy weapons fire, including missile launchers. Captain Rex conceived of a plan to have two troopers sneak into a nearby airbase and commandeer two enemy starfighters in the hopes that its heavy weaponry would be powerful enough to penetrate and destroy the tanks. While the two troopers left for the job, the two MHC tanks, later reinforced by a third MHC tank, continued obliterating the clones, trampling them as well as blasting them away. Rex picked up a missile launcher and fired at the tank but to no avail. Rex tried a second time, this time aiming for the massive cannon. The missile struck the cannon, successfully taking it out but barely making the situation any better. As the Umbarans stepped their offensive, the two troopers had successfully stolen two Umbaran starfighters and managed to destroy the tanks using the heavy blasters of the starfighters. With the tanks destroyed, the clones managed to secure the airbase."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
