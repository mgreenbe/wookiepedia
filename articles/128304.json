A Mon Calamari Star Cruiser commanded by Commodore Yat-De Viedas, he was so impressed with it he told the Alliance leadership that he would not hear a word against it. It was the location of a meeting between Mon Mothma, Princess Leia Organa, Garm Bel Iblis and Captain Juno Eclipse following the failed skirmish at Cato Neimoidia.
