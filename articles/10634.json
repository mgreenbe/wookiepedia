In existence by the year 67 BBY, the Aurodium Spoon was placed in a public square full of boutique shops and restaurants, with a pedestrian tunnel opening onto one side of the square. In 67 BBY, Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Plagueis and his medical droid 11-4D pursued a shapeshifting Shi'ido in the square in which the Aurodium Spoon resided. However, by changing to the form of a humanoid Askajian, the Shi'ido eluded the pair until Plagueis directed his droid's attention to the Askajian currently passing by the Aurodium Spoon. In the end, the pair captured the Shi'ido."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Aurodium Spoon appears in the 2012 novel Darth Plagueis, written by James Luceno."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
