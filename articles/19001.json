Sarne ordered the assault on the city after the population of Kolatill ousted Tetrum, their Imperial governor, and declared their allegiance to the New Republic, who had recently liberated the neighboring world of Kal'Shebbol. TIE/sa bombers, deployed from the Ton-Falk-class escort carrier Kathol Protector, attacked the city, leveling buildings and leaving the city aflame.

Kal'Shebbol was the capital of the Kathol sector, and the seat of power for Moff Kentor Sarne, who ruled the sector in the name of the Galactic Empire and, later, as a warlord, following the fracturing of the Imperial Military in the wake of the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY. Kolatill's citizenry re-established the Kolatill Council\u2014which had been forcibly disbanded during Sarne's rule\u2014and promptly declared their allegiance to the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The bombing"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sarne, in retaliation for Kolatill's act of defiance, dispatched the Ton-Falk-class escort carrier Kathol Protector to the Kolatill system. The Kathol Protector approached Kolatill, releasing TIE/sa bombers; targeting the capital city of Domaz, the bombers proceeded to assault the city with conventional explosive ordnance. The attack reduced many areas of the city to rubble and left large portions of the city in flames. The bombers eventually disengaged and regrouped with the Kathol Protector. The escort carrier subsequently withdrew from the system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Domaz left in chaos, citizens of the city pulled together to deal with the disaster. Volunteer groups formed to deal with rescue operations; tending to the injured, creating temporary shelters, and fighting the many fires raging across the city. The Kolatill Council issued an emergency distress call to the New Republic forces stationed at Kal'Shebbol, requesting urgent assistance. The CR90 corvette FarStar\u2014which was in orbit of the planet preparing to undertake a mission to track down Sarne after he had fled from Kal'Shebbol during the New Republic's assault on the world\u2014received the transmission. The commanding officer, Captain Keleman Ciro, ordered the FarStar to Kolatill to assist in relief operations, while Governor Monjai, the newly-appointed New Republic official on Kal'Shebbol, promised to send further assistance in a few days."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The FarStar arrived several days after the attack and assisted in relief operations in the city. While in orbit, the ship was forced to defend Kolatill from a second attack by the Kathol Protector, which deployed TIE bombers armed with pathogenic bombs. The New Republic force was able to successfully defend the planet, ensuring no further harm was inflicted upon its citizens."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bombing of Domaz was first referenced in the roleplaying game adventure Omens, which was the first scenario for The DarkStryder Campaign, published by West End Games in 1995. The bombing was the reason that brought the players' ship, the FarStar, to the planet Kolatill, so that the characters could assist in relief operations and defend the planet from the second Imperial attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
