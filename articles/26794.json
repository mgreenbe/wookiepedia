Angry, the survivors of the Church decided to assassinate Torbin, and followed him to the Corporate Sector, where an attractive female cultist lured him toward a variable-gravity swimming pool. She pushed him and his bodyguard into the pool, while other cultists increased the strength of the force field, sealing it, and faking a radiation leak drill to prevent others from realizing what was happening. Unfortunately for the Church survivors, Odumin managed to rescue the Grand Inquisitor. Despite this, Torbin was assassinated the next month on Weerden."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
