In the aftermath, the New Republic has faced a constant struggle to survive and grow. And now a new threat looms: a masterpiece of Alderaanian art, lost in transit after the planet's destruction, has resurfaced on the black market. Offered at auction, it will command a handsome price, but its greatest value lies in the vital secret it conceals the key to a code used to communicate with New Republic agents deep undercover within the Empire. Discovery of the key by Imperial forces would spell certain disaster. The only option is recovery, and Han, Leia, Chewbacca, and C-3PO have been dispatched to Tatooine to infiltrate the auction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "But trouble is waiting when they arrive: an Imperial Star Destroyer is orbiting Tatooine on the lookout for Rebels; a mysterious stranger at the auction seems to recognize Leia; and an Imperial officer's aggressive bidding for the Alderaanian painting could foil the Solos' mission.

Their mission is to recover an Alderaanian work of art, titled the Killik Twilight, because within Killik Twilight lies a communications device that acts as a link between the New Republic and their spies acting as undercover agents all around the dying Galactic Empire. The Millennium Falcon gets into a dogfight with Imperial forces, led by Grand Admiral Thrawn, but manages to arrive on the surface of Tatooine and dock under cover from the enemy forces. Then, under disguises at a local cantina, the Solos attend an auction there in order to retrieve the Killik Twilight. One of the items on sale is a holographic image of the late Anakin Skywalker back in 32 BBY just after he won the Boonta Eve Podrace. Leia is distraught at the image of who had once been her father, whom she has only known as the evil Darth Vader in the Rebel Alliance's war with the Empire. The image is sold, nevertheless, to another auctioneer, and the disturbance of the image wrought upon by Leia leads into a conversation between her and Han, discussing the prospects about having children. Leia is reluctant to do so, because of her biological family's line in the Force and of her father's legacy as Vader. She fears that it may be too possible for whatever children she and Han tend to bear one day will fall to the dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time the Killik Twilight is up for grabs, violence breaks out from the Imperial forces attending the auction who intend to retrieve the art piece.

During their voyage, Leia finds out more about her late father's past, and runs into Anakin's old friend, Kitster Chanchani Banai, who reveals to her what her father was like before he left Tatooine under the guidance of the late Qui-Gon Jinn. Leia also retrieves a holojournal recorded by Shmi, revealing details of her life in between Anakin's departure from Tatooine to his return to his home planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Leia finally comes to terms with her father's legacy and no longer fears that her children will fall to the dark side, after she learns that her father was once a young, innocent boy, and a fairly decent individual prior to his fall as Vader.
