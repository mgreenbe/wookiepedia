A candle that had just been lit emitted timid light that grew in intensity. In his private quarters at the Jedi Temple of Coruscant, the Grand Master of the Jedi Order Yoda kept several candles. At some point toward the later stages of the Clone Wars, the Force ghost of the late Qui-Gon Jinn caused Yoda's candles to stir in order to manifest his presence. One type of candle was the votive candle, which was the most common offering brought to the Tomb of Miktrull on Zeffo. They were often lit as a sign of respect and reverence to Sage Miktrull. Generally encased in metal and adorned with carvings. It was said that their flames represented Miktrull's unending power in the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
