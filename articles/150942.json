The model had a bare humanoid frame[source?] cast from a blue hardened plastic, and had a vacuum arm made from black flexi-hose. One was equipped with a stiff wire brush to remove persistent stains and the other had an attachment for cleaning upholstery. Both arms connected to the storage bin located in its middle, emptied via a hinged panel at the back. The droids were usually employed as robotic janitors or night maids.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The U2-C1 model lacked a personality matrix, though it had a photoreceptor slot and a vocabulator capable of speaking Basic, because Publictechnic chose to eschew a streamlined frame personality matrix to achieve a more cost effective line. The droid's external parts snapped off easily, but replacement units were dirt cheap, and consumer complaints were rare.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In later years, thieves found the droid's household keeping software easy to infiltrate and alter. Being a common sight in most establishments meant it was hardly noticed.[source?] In one hotel, a unit was programmed to go into the rooms of customers and vacuum up jewelry and credit vouchers. Another one sucked up a time bomb into its belly and exploded outside of the office of the executive as it passed on its way to buff the lobby floor.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
