Like all Slayers, Vua was bred from Force-sensitive Human slaves grown from tissue samples taken from Jedi that had been augmented and transformed by Yuuzhan Vong shapers to serve Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane as elite warriors. At some stage, Vua became bethrothed to another Yuuzhan Vong. Shortly prior to the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar at the conclusion of the war, Vua was dispatched on the orders of Shimrra to fly a Slayer ship poisoned with the pathogen Alpha Red onto the living planet Zonama Sekot in an attempt to kill the sentient world. However, Zonama Sekot used its gravitic power to fling the starfighter away and Vua's mission was unsuccessful. Soon afterward, the Yuuzhan Vong surrendered during a final battle over Yuuzhan'tar and the surviving Vong, including Vua's bethrothed, were sent to live on Zonama Sekot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the battle, Vua came to be regarded by the galactic population as analagous to the Yuuzhan Vong's enemy, the Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, as a lone pilot who had taken on an entire weaponized world; Skywalker having destroyed the Death Star battlestation during the Battle of Yavin of the Galactic Civil War. In the aftermath of the Yuuzhan Vong War, Vua was captured by One Sith, a resurgent Sith faction active on the planet Korriban and was forced to become a Sith apprentice, adopting the Sith name \"Darth Vua\".

Vua was to be referenced within a brief extract from his personal holocron written from an in-universe perspective and the subsequent publication of the content in Author's Cut brought it into Legends continuity. The extract references the events of the novel The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force which depicts the attempt by a Slayer ship to poison Zonama Sekot with Alpha Red, by establishing Vua as the vessel's pilot.
