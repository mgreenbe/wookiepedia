It existed in order to appease the Imperial Senate regarding the Imperial Military's doings. To avoid having to fill out the form, gunnery captain Bolvan of the Star Destroyer Devastator ordered his subordinate Hija not to fire at an escape pod with no lifesigns jettisoned from the Tantive IV during its capture over Tatooine. However, Bolvan later realized the pod had likely had the stolen Death Star plans hidden inside it, and came to fleet logistics liaison Arvira for help covering up his mistake."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Form XTM-51-CT was first mentioned in the short story \"The Sith of Datawork\" from the 2017 anthology From a Certain Point of View."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
