It featured the primary escape pod in the primary crew area. The 3-Z was as fast as the YT-1200. It was also as fast at sublight speeds as a stock YT-1300, and featured some moderate improvements over the YT-1300. Such included the central-dorsal mounted sensor dish provided a greater scanning radius, the standard port-starboard mounted laser cannons provided quality all around its firing arcs, the forward-opening cargo bay allowed easy access, and the cockpit featured a more open canopy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Corellian Engineering Corporation sub-licensed the manufacturing plans of its YT-1200 to Nova-Drive a few months after the licensor halted its production in favor of newer models; CEC had deemed the line too dated for active production.
