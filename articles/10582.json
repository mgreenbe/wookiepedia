They used the Eternal Furnace, a giant lava pool for their most audacious and important projects. Apprentices to the guild spend many years just developing the tolerances necessary to work in the presence of such fiery heat, and the most incredible works of glass known in the galaxy come from the artisans who work with the Furnace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
