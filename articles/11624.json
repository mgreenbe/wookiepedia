The Baanu Miir did not use dovin basals to provide its artificial gravity, but instead spun on its axis. The vessel was filled with twelve thousand Yuuzhan Vong of various castes, though it seemed that they were mostly those of lower status. Also, the rikyam was beginning to die as well, and was losing control of the ship's functions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nen Yim was banished to the vessel after her involvement in the shaping of Tahiri Veila.
