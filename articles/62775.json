The building contained a hallway with numerous turns that linked the entrance to the main conference room, which was a large circular chamber containing tables and chairs for diplomatic discussions. Like many buildings on Alderaan, it featured large statues, tan flooring, and a color scheme of crimson and gold. The embassy was protected by guards under the command of Captain Yils, as well as under Count Alde, who conducted business there when he was visiting Castle Organa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3643 BBY, during the Cold War between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic, Count Alde was visiting the embassy when the Mirialan Aleyna Hark arrived, claiming to be the only survivor of an attack on the Mensaav Laboratory\u2014a facility where the Republic was working on the weapon known as the Death Mark laser using Alde funding. A young Jedi Knight who had been sent to secure the Death Mark laser soon joined Count Alde, but Hark\u2014actually an Imperial spy\u2014took the opportunity to tag the Count with the targeting device of the Death Mark. During their conversation, the Sith Lord Nefarid activated the Death Mark satellite in orbit above Alderaan, killing Count Alde with a laser strike.

After the Knight's departure, Yils and his subordinates closed the embassy to the public."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Alde embassy first appeared in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare and LucasArts, as a class-restricted location for the Jedi Knight class mission \"The Death Mark.\" Yils can either be fought for dark side alignment points, or convinced to release the Knight for light side points. As a Republic character, the Jedi Knight is assumed to only choose the light side options, so this article assumes the Knight left without fighting the guards.
