Though born with soft skin, the slugs would digest the duracrete, then secrete it through their skin or excrete it to form a hard outer shell of armor-like skin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As its underdeveloped eyesight was all but useless, leaving the creature blind, the duracrete slug's main sensory apparatus was a series of tentacles around its mouth that served as feelers to sense its surroundings. The slugs also used two of their power mandibles to devour duracrete in large quantities. The slug's armored skin was tan in color, while its two small eyes were black. The body of an adult slug could grow up to ten meters (thirty-two feet, eight inches) in length but they averaged between three and five meters. Each slug was covered in a series of spiked ridges that ran from the creature's mouth to its tail."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behavior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Duracrete slugs were burrowers capable of causing much more damage then granite slugs and generally could be found in the lowest levels or foundation of a building.

Adapting to incorporate the artificial into their biology, they fed on the duracrete used in the construction of buildings in the Coruscant Underworld and came to pose a threat to the area's structural stability. As most of the city's foundations was filled with duracrete, the slugs could weaken the foundations of the buildings above, causing untold mayhem and destruction and making the species a dangerous nuisance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Exterminators on Coruscant carried pest control equipment to eradicate duracrete slugs and were deployed by the city authorities in constant campaigns to keep the infestations under control. In around 90 BBY, the Jedi Initiate Sifo-Dyas mentioned duracrete slugs while trying to convince his friend Dooku not to antagonise their fellow Initiate Arath Tarrex during a trip to the planet Serenno."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the new Star Wars canon, duracrete slugs were first mentioned in the 2015 reference book Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know.
