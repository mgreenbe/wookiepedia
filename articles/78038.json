The reptile's skin was glossy yellow with vibrant blue and green mottled spots running down its back. It had large bulbous black eyes and rubbery, sticky pads on its feet that allowed it to climb surfaces of sheer rock. When attacking, it could also make use of sharp teeth like needles and the ability to breathe out corrosive gas. Krendels were born and raised in Recopia's toxic seas but developped lungs and limbs later. These biological advantages enabled them to creep on land in search of their prey, usually seabirds nesting in the island cliffs. Krendel having no keen sense of sight, hunted primarily by scent and motion. They were hunting in mated pairs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
