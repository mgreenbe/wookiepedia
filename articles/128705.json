It was here that potential SoroSuub Corporation employees would be trained before being allowed into the company. Though most of the students were Sullustans, there were rare occasions in which they would allow beings of other species to study here. The classes were split into semesters, and at the end of the course there was a final graduation exam. Though there were strict rules at the academy, it was possible for students to use tricks and scare tactics against other students to get ahead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
