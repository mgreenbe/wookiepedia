The ship was armed with four forward-facing laser cannons placed on each of the secondary wings. Also, the powerful starfighter was equipped with a harpoon gun, missile launcher, and another backward-facing laser cannon directly behind the cockpit to surprise the enemy. Instead of an astromech unit for flight adjustment, it held an XT droid. It had been known that Vane built several squadrons of similar fighters in his hidden base in the Veil Nebula."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
