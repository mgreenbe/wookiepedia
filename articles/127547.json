During the war, Sliver lived on the planet Nal Hutta, where he worked in a cantina known as the Poison Pit within Jiguuna, an industrial town controlled by a Hutt crime lord named Suudaa Nem'ro. His job was to sell tokens for the cantina's jukebox, with each token costing 125 credits. The tokens allowed patrons of the cantina to choose what song the jukebox would play next from a short list of available tracks. Sliver wore a brown tunic and pants while working at the cantina and had green skin and black eyes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sliver first appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, which was released by BioWare in 2011.
