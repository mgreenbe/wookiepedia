The condition was characterized by a very low blood pressure, causing the clone trooper to faint each time he tried to stand. Jedi Padawan Barriss Offee later discovered that the condition was caused by a damage to the trooper's hypothalamus and cured it with the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
