The scientist was assigned to Leia Organa Solo's Senate Select Committee for Refugees staff on Duro in 26 ABY. Along with Sidris Kolb, Cawa was responsible for the surface water of the planet, an endeavor that encountered many setbacks and was made more complicated by Sidris Kolb's cloud seeding efforts.
