A team of spacers infiltrated the citadel and killed a number of Inquisitors along the way. Eventually, they found Valin Draco torturing Denia and they engaged him in combat. However, he was too powerful and was about to defeat them, so Denia sacrificed herself to save the rescue team. This weakened Draco and he was forced to flee Prakith in his personal shuttle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
