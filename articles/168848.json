They possessed horned skulls and mottled white skin, as well as small tails, thin strands of hair, and salt glands behind each of their eyes. The Zybahhod Yenyoni also played an instrument known as the udjudg. Well-adapted biologically to desert life, they lived in tribes and were semi-nocturnal. Some Zybahhod Yenyoni dwelled on Tatooine. When the arid heat of Tatooine's twin suns became too much for the Zybahhod Yenyoni to bear, they retreated to underground caverns for respite."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sentient Zybahhod Yenyoni were roughly the same height as Humans, at approximately 1.75 meters, and were humanoid in appearance insofar as they possessed two legs and two arms. They had five digits on each hand, which could be used to grapple objects. The Zybahhod Yenyoni also featured four horns atop their head, with two above the brow, and a further two back toward the crest of the skull. Between the latter two horns, the Zybahhod Yenyoni possessed another, less severe protrusion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The species' biology allowed them to endure in harsh deserts. The skin of the Zybahhod Yenyoni lacked sweat glands; instead they featured salt glands, housed in openings behind each of their eyes. The glands removed the salt from the brackish water that they had to drink. They possessed two yellow eyes and a mouth, as well as a \"Y\"-shaped naso-facial opening. Their skin, which was predominately mottled, was white, although their chest and bellies were covered by a large, un-mottled patch. The Zybahhod Yenyoni also featured blue, pointed nipples, a small tail with a tuft of hair at the end, sharp teeth, and individual strands of hair sprouting from the head and limbs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Zybahhod Yenyoni were organized into tribes. The Zybahhod Yenyoni carried their young in pouches slung across their backs, and wore footwear made from a scaled texture. The Zybahhod Yenyoni footwear also boasted a single, sharp claw at the toe. They also utilized long, U-shaped udjudg musical instruments, which they played with their \"Y\"-shaped naso-facial openings. Some Zybahhod Yenyoni tribes lived on the arid world of Tatooine. Due to the advantages afforded them by their biological makeup, they were well-adapted to life in the desert. Those Zybahhod Yenyoni were semi-nocturnal and took refuge in underground caves when the twin suns of Tatooine rose."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Zybahhod Yenyoni hailed from the Zybahhod system, located in the Herios sector of the southern-eastern portion of the Outer Rim Territories. They shared their home sector with the Poss'Nomin and Excargan species. At some point, several tribes of Zybahhod Yenyoni lived on Tatooine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jennifer Kay, at the age of twenty-six, created the Zybahhod Yenyoni through the \"Design An Alien\" competition held by Star Wars Galaxy magazine. The competition, which was launched in Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 3 (1995), called for participants to design aliens inspired by the original trilogy of Star Wars films. Kay's entry came third in the \"sixteen years old and up\" division of the competition, the results of which were published in Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 7 (1996). Her entry placed behind the Ubese Thorn-Back War Dragon and the Lyco Pibex, respectively. Star Wars Holocron continuity database keeper Leland Chee has stated that all published content from the contest is canon. The Zybahhod system was later created as a home system for the species by Jason Fry in the Star Wars: The Essential Atlas Online Companion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Kay's artwork, the Zybahhod Yenyoni appear to be wearing a type of footwear, however, the image's lack of color makes this difficult to determine. The article assumes that the individual is wearing footwear, due to the fact that it appears to be of a different texture to the individual's skin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
