A handheld device, they emitted waves of high frequency sound that warded off many creatures while at the same time being inaudible to Human and many other alien species' hearing.

The Merr-Sonn Excluder had three settings, capable of creating a disruption field of 10, 20 or 40 meters, respectively."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A small group of Rebels, including Homack, used excluders while on a mission to the planet Hethar.
