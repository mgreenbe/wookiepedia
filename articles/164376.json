The packs were used in conjunction with a jump platform to glide across the landscapes of Solay. After strapping on a wing pack, an individual would be propelled into the air by a jump platform and would then activate the wing pack, which would release two large wings. The release mechanism was controlled by a pull cord on the side, which the wearer yanked at the top of his or her jump."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 4 ABY, Luke Skywalker employed a wing pack to pursue the fleeing ex-King Blackart.
