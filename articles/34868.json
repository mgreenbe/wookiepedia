He and two other assassins accompanied Vader to Aargau to kill the finance minister of the Rebellion, Viscount Tardi. He used his telekinetic power to change the course of a missile and aimed it at Tardi, but he was foiled when R2-D2 projected a holographic image of Tardi onto the valet, and an image of the valet onto Tardi. Since the telekinetic had to psychologically place himself in the position of the missile in order to direct it, he inadvertently guided the missile to hit himself and he died as a result."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
