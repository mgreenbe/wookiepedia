Meanwhile, Ren's allies, the Knights of Ren, battle agents of Sector Security, who were attempting to apprehend the brothers based on their crime of having killed at least a hundred people. Ren tells Karrst that he can join him and become a Knight of Ren, and that the Knights heard of him from a \"friend,\" who told them that Karrst was Force-sensitive.

From their starship, the Verity, Jedi trainees Hennix, Tai, and Voe observe the fiery destruction. Hennix tells the others that they should land and help, but Voe says that she does not sense anyone on the ground. However, Tai does sense a presence, that of Solo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Tai's instincts, they land near the temple, where they confront Solo. Ben tells them that Luke Skywalker attempted to murder him in his sleep, and that the Jedi is now dead. Voe tells Solo that he would not be able to kill Skywalker, to which Ben rebuts that he is stronger than the three other Jedi combined. Solo tells them the temple was a lie that is now over and he's leaving. Despite Tai's protestations, Hennix and Voe draw their lightsabers to prevent Solo from running away. When Voe attacks Solo, he freezes her in mid-air and throws her into Hennix."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The three Jedi prepare to take on Solo together, but he uses the Force to violently levitate debris from the temple and hurls it at them. Solo stops when he realizes Hennix has been impaled in the side by a large piece of debris. Voe attempts to remove it, but Hennix tells her that the procedure will be safer on the Verity. Tai and Voe decide to prioritize saving Hennix over preventing Solo's escape, and Solo leaves in a nearby ship, the Grimtaash."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back on the Verity, Tai tends to Hennix's wounds while Voe pilots the ship, giving chase to the Grimtaash.

Geegee asks if Solo intends to visit his mother, Leia Organa, whom he has not seen in some time. As Solo hesitates, a disembodied voice which is familiar to Solo asks if something has happened that the two thought might someday occur. Solo experiences a flashback, beginning with the moment in which he and Skywalker crossed blades. Solo brings his cabin down upon them and then emerges from the wreckage. Solo rages in anger and confusion over why his uncle attacked him. The temple has a clear night sky above it and Solo points his ignited lightsaber at the temple as he screams for answers. His pupils constrict as his eyes cloud with red, and matching red storm clouds appear above the temple. As he sees them, the clouds erupt with lightning that explodes the temple, sets it ablaze, and kills the students inside. Solo is knocked off his feet and rises to see the scattered bodies of dead students. When he attempts to run into the burning temple, he is again knocked down by an explosion. He watches the burning temple and says he didn't want this. The disembodied voice tells Solo that he did not choose this; Skywalker did. In the present, Solo tells Geegee he isn't going to Hosnian Prime and sets his new course."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the Verity, Tai says that they have to find Solo and speculates on using the Force to do so. Hennix enters the cockpit and tells them that they will be able to track the Grimtaash through a transponder that Geegee will activate once they leave, which is standard procedure in case something were to go wrong on a mission. Tai asks if they should call Solo's mother, Leia Organa, and tell her what has happened, but Voe tells him that they should discover the truth behind Solo's betrayal and the destruction of the temple before they involve a third party."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Snoke's embrace"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Solo lands the Grimtaash at an unidentified space station, where he meets with Snoke.

Snoke turns the subject to what Skywalker nearly did to Solo, but Solo says it doesn't matter because he killed Skywalker. Snoke doubts that Skywalker has died and says they can set aside that problem for now. Snoke asks Solo what he plans to do now that he is no longer under Skywalker's instruction. Solo says that he has been thinking about the Knights of Ren."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Editions"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
