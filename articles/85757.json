The course had a rocky surface, and contained several sharp turns and long straightaways, the latter which served as good opportunities for pilots to use their thrusters. The track also moved through a sizable methane lake, which was covered in a green haze. The Vulptereen pilot Dud Bolt was favored here, and would race against other pilots using his Vulptereen 327 Podracer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The course first appeared, unnamed, in the 1999 Gameboy Color video game Star Wars Episode I: Racer.
