It was from the royal balcony that the Death Watch made their first appearance, promising to do what the Duchess could not\u2014stop the attacking gangsters. After Death Watch staged their victory, the Duchess was arrested in the throne room and the Shadow Collective leaders\u2014Ziton Moj, Lom Pyke, and Savage Opress\u2014were brought before the Mandalorians to turn the people in favor of the Death Watch so that Pre Vizsla could be declared Prime Minister. Once Vizsla had a tight grip on the planet, he betrayed Darth Maul, subduing him and presenting him to the people as an object lesson of the danger of being weak. Maul returned, however, after escaping from prison, and challenge Vizsla to a duel in the throne room. Ultimately, Maul killed Vizsla, and sparked a firefight between those in the Death Watch who gave their loyalty to Maul, and those who refused to follow an outsider, led by Bo-Katan Kryze. After Maul reinstated Almec as Prime Minister, he gave his acceptance speech from the royal balcony, promising a bright future as Mandalore returned to its warrior past."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Darth Maul captured Obi-Wan Kenobi and Satine Kryze as Kenobi was trying to rescue Kryze, he had them brought to the throne room, where he executed the Duchess. Sometime later during the battle that engulfed Sundari, the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious arrived on Mandalore and entered the throne room, killing two soldiers before he confronted the two brothers. After exchanging brief words with Maul, he ignited two lightsabers and challenged them to a duel. Sidious led the duel away from the throne room, onto the balcony, and down to the plaza below.
