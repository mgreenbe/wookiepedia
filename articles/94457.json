Mzzrzz claimed to know of a divine consciousness inside a lump of bantha dung, which he believed could lead the galaxy to a new age of enlightenment. At some point during his life, Mzzrzz lost at least half of his head, though he survived for some time despite the injuries. After being captured by the Empire and held prisoner aboard the flagship Executor in 3 ABY, the scholar Korin Aphra mentioned Mzzrzz and his theory while criticizing the Sith Lord Darth Vader's claim that the Empire created its own history."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mzzrzz was mentioned in the comic Doctor Aphra 38, written by Simon Spurrier and published by Marvel Comics on November 6, 2019."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
