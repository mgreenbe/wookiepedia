The Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader, the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, the Snivvian con man Marn Hierogryph, and the Gungan Jar Jar Binks were also present in the battle, although Vader and Skywalker were busy dueling each other and thus did not participate in the primary fight. Upon his emergence, Todd witnessed a fight between Carrick and Mandalore. Surprised by Todd's appearance, Carrick demanded to know his identity. In response to Carrick's question, Todd introduced himself, stating that he was roleplaying as a Jedi, and claimed that all combatants present there were his unwitting pawns. As the battle continued, Binks began to feel confused."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Light-skinned with light-brown hair and brown eyes, Todd was dressed in garb reminiscent of traditional brown Jedi robes.
