Her criminal activities influenced her racing style; she was furtive and shy on the circuit, keeping her distance from other pilots and only defending her position when absolutely necessary. The existence of her storehouse was discovered in 22 BBY by Republic agents and was one of several events that tarnished the reputation of the sport.
