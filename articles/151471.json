Consisting of comprehensive holographic readouts and heads up displays, when activated the system would envelop the hands of the user in holographic spheres - hand gestures and motions would then control the craft or system in question. This system was extremely hard to use without training, as shown by Hardcase when he flew an Umbaran starfighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This technology was used extensively in the hi-tech Umbaran starfighter, hovertank, and mobile heavy cannons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
