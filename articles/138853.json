Their primary weapons were a pair of fire-linked heavy laser cannons mounted to the hull. The cannons had a fixed forward-firing arc, although, they could easily be brought to bear on enemy targets due to the TX-130's agility. The TX-130 was also equipped with either a twin medium laser cannon turret atop the tank or a Taim & Bak KB-50a beam cannon. Some tanks were not equipped with a top gun."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TX-130 also made use of rapid-fire ordnance launcher mounted on each of the vehicle's sponsions. This ordnance launcher could utilize Armor-Piercing Shells, \"Bunker Buster\" shells, or High-Energy shells.

A group of TX-130 Saber-class fighter tanks was referred to as a squadron, while another sized group was referred to as a platoon.
