By this time Nuum had come to consider Chusker a great threat to his own safety, and as such demanded that the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure kill his associate as a favor to him. Jabba, who had only heard of Chusker but not met him, refused and Nuum imprisoned him in the hopes he would change his mind. The Hutt escaped with the help of Nuum's son Rusk and killed his captor, following which he killed Rusk and then his sister Norba as well when they claimed power and also demanded that Chusker die. Shortly after the demise of the Nuum family, Chusker arrived on Smarteel to meet with Nuum and ran into Jabba. He questioned the Hutt as to why he was on Smarteel and once Jabba learned who Chusker was he crushed him with his tail."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chusker was a member of a species which had blue skin, black eyes and purple blood.
