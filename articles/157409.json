The smuggler was known by a friend of Anandra Milon's Alderaanian family, who promised Milon and her younger brother, Santigo Milon, that the smuggler could get them off Coruscant in a transport so that they could escape from the Empire, which had begun arresting Alderaanians following the loss of their homeworld. However, the smuggler left Coruscant without the two Alderaanians, as the pair were two days late in arriving on Level 2142, where they had agreed to meet the smuggler."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The smuggler was mentioned in \"One Thousand Levels Down\", a short story written by Alexander Freed and published in Star Wars Insider 151 on July 22, 2014.
