Situated above Lonisa City, the pavilions represented a selection of the Galactic Republic's most key members, including Spira, Bestine, Boz Pity, Jaresh, Alderaan, Onderon, Rhinnal, and Hetzal Prime. The largest and most central island represented Coruscant, the Republic's capital. Held aloft by repulsorlifts, the islands contained representations of the planets' environments maintained by sophisticated environmental controls, allowing for the snow on Rhinnal's island to stay cold even in Valo's summer heat. The pavilions were destroyed during a Nihil attack on the fair, being knocked out of the sky onto either the city or Lake Lonisa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
