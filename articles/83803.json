The sensor arrays of the starship encircled the command centerspheres, while giant Central Control Computers designed to radio commands to the massive droid armies from remote locations helped Trade Federation officials command battles far from danger. At over three kilometers in diameter, the Control Ship featured a massive sphere in the center of the craft that contained the control bridge for usually Neimoidian officers along with its reactor assemblies. The outer half-circle featured large hangars lined with forward docking claws."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Interior"}, {"tag": "h5", "text": "Federation starship"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Federation officials needing to live aboard the starship for multiple months, the Lucrehulk was effectively an entire planet within realspace.

These rooms were made to place clients at a disadvantage using \"concentration deficit\" chairs and remote gas emitters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aboard the bridge, the Lucrehulk was dominated by a throne-like navigation station with pilot droids on navigation computers. The Bridge was extremely well defended with triple blast doors and reinforced hull plating. Neimoidian officials rarely left the Bridge in case one of their colleagues were to form an alliance against them.

In addition to this month-long blockade, the Federation landed troops from its battleships to secure the planet. After this, the blockade was disbanded, leaving the Control Ship as the only ship left in orbit around the planet. It was soon attacked by Bravo Flight, but its deflector shield was too strong. In the midst of the battle, the young Force-sensitive pilot Anakin Skywalker accidentally flew inside the ship's hangar. As Skywalker attempted to make his escape, he fired upon the droids attacking his fighter and inadvertently fired two proton torpedoes into the starboard main reactor. The Control Ship started blowing up from the inside to Bravo Flight's surprise as Skywalker flew from the hanger bay. Finally, the ship's sphere exploded from the main reactor overloading, saving the Gungan Grand Army from destruction by disrupting the Control Ship's signal, shutting down the B1 battle droids below.

The battleships became part of the fleet of the Confederacy of Independent Systems and saw action in various battles. Several battleships were part of the Christophsis blockade, and Captain Mar Tuuk commanded a battleship as head of the Ryloth blockade, although Tuuk's ship was destroyed by Anakin Skywalker, who was now a Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic, during the Battle of Ryloth. Lucrehulk-class Battleships with their original design having none of the Separatist colors and logos were used in the blockade of Pantora, under the command of Sib Canay.
