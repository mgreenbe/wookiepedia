Her start in Starfighter Command was discolored by a corrupt training instructor, Atton Repness, who tarnished her record after she threatened to expose his fraudulent activities. After graduating at the bottom of her class, she became one of the founding members of Gray Squadron under Commander Wedge Antilles, and supplied the unit's permanent name: Wraith Squadron.

She and Tainer had two children, a daughter, Jesmin, who later joined the squadron of her father and a son named Doran, who also inherited Sarkin's Force sensitivity and became her apprentice.

Repness, however, planned to meet the young pilot trainee at the ditch site and make off with the fighter to sell it on the black market. Sarkin refused, saying that she was going to turn in her crooked commanding officer to the authorities. When the seemingly-shocked Repness begged for time to set his affairs in order, Sarkin naively acquiesced and unwittingly gave the major time to cover his tracks and put her up on charges of gross insubordination. Challenging the corrupt officer again, Sarkin was confronted with the truth of her piloting scores: Repness had been recording them inaccurately high. Sarkin would have washed out of even the remedial program weeks before if her true scores had been reported. In exchange for a chance to graduate at the bottom of her class with her falsely-recorded passing marks, the young woman kept silent about Repness's crooked side business.

As they discussed the mission at a tapcafe on Folor Base, DownTime, Sarkin was the first to recognize Ekwesh's possession of multiple minds, and passed on the story of the droid waiter Squeaky and the Runaway Droid Ride to her future squadmates. She also soon met future Wraiths Garik \"the Face\" Loran and Ton Phanan, the latter of whom revealed Sarkin's Force-sensitivity to the other pilots. As the fellow candidates learned more about each other, they began to realize that almost all of them were very close to washing out of Starfighter Command for one reason or another.

She left him at the table to contemplate her rejection, but it was not the only memorable event of the day. At their mission briefing that afternoon, the group was informed that Sarkin's suggestion for a name had been chosen as the official one for the unit: Wraith Squadron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later that day, the Wraiths launched in preparation for their hyperspace practice mission.

It was not long before they realized that an Imperial Star Destroyer, Implacable, was approaching Folor. Immediately, Antilles ordered a return to Folor to prepare a hasty defense while the base was evacuated.

But even with the squadron's successes, Sarkin's self-pity had become enough of a concern to her squadmates that they approached her in the mess hall, as she was spending as much of her free time as possible in the X-wing simulator. During the conversation, in which Kell Tainer, Ton Phanan and Grinder Thri'ag attempted to convince her to relax, Thri'ag suggested a way to increase her performance as a pilot. The Bothan offered to slice into her records and improve her scores. Sarkin, thinking only of her history with Atton Repness and not realizing that Thri'ag's offer was made in jest, attacked the other pilot.

The conversation did her good, helping calm her down and allowing the other pilots to suggest ways for her to improve her performance in the squadron, both as a pilot and using skills learned as an Antarian Ranger.

Sarkin was able to finally show her squadmates the set of skills that set her apart from the other pilots. Moving silently and using the noise of the wind to cover her movements for added stealth, she led an impressed Wedge Antilles to the bunker to cover the approach of the other Wraiths. Once they had successfully infiltrated the bunker, however, Sarkin, Ekwesh, and Phanan were attacked by Imperial Probe Droid A2. Sarkin's tactics of taking cover behind a phototropically shielded TIE/LN starfighter viewport and then pinning the droid with a repulsorlift cart allowed Tainer to destroy the enemy probot with his demolitions equipment. Given the Omega Signal, a cue to terminate the mission, she and Ekwesh also used their blasters to cover the squadron's exit as the other Wraiths piled into a cargo skiff to escape. Then Sarkin and Ekwesh scrambled aboard as the skiff shot past the remaining guards into the night, shortly before explosives left behind by Tainer destroyed the complex.

Much more emboldened than she had been in her previous engagements, Sarkin even led most of the squadron in a challenging launch from the bow hold of the Night Caller even as the corvette maneuvered away from incoming pirate snubfighters that ambushed them suddenly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the ensuing battle, Sarkin became Kell Tainer's temporary wingman. As she and Tainer chased down a pair of Uglies, Sarkin recognized that they were being led into an ambush. She could not identify how she knew, but Tainer trusted the Force-sensitive woman enough to realize himself that the pirates were trying to use a tactic of leading them to three treaded ground vehicles hidden in a crater on the moon's surface. Sarkin managed to hit one of the vehicles with a proton torpedo. The resulting explosion, combined with that of Tainer's weapon, destroyed the ground vehicles just after they launched their own missiles and lasers, which struck the fighters of temporary wingmen Jesmin Ackbar and Myn Donos."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sarkin broke off from Tainer as he attempted to rescue Ackbar after the other pilot's craft was hit, and took her own fighter into position behind Donos, who had suddenly gone catatonic over the loss of his astromech droid. Although the lieutenant would barely answer her communications, she knew how to make Donos responsive. She recognized the similarity of the mission to the one that ended in Talon Squadron's destruction, and knew that Donos was distraught over the destruction of his droid, whom he viewed as the last member of his old unit, Talon Squadron. She used Talon Squadron callsigns to get his attention, and led him safely back to the Night Caller. Tainers' efforts, on the other hand proved futile & Jesmin's X-Wing crashed, killing the Wraith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of the mission, Sarkin was able to help some of her squadmates deal with the repercussions. She helped Tainer and Phanan cover for Donos's continuing mental breakdown, and comforted Tainer in what he saw as his own personal failure to save Jesmin.

In this act, several pilots placed Donos in a simulator and re-enacted the final battle of Talon Squadron, using their voices to tell him that his catatonia indicated he wasn't being faithful to their memories, that his refusal to live was spitting on their graves. After a seething Donos emerged, Sarkin intuitively recognized that what set off Donos was the loss of his droid, who he considered to be the last Talon.

Sarkin participated in the mission by posing as the wife of an out-of-luck test pilot, played by Ton Phanan. Once they had been admitted to Storinal under these disguises, they joined Kell Tainer, and later slicer Eurrsk Thri'ag, to form Plague Group.

The group used this vent to gained entrance to the Institute, with Sarkin thinking ahead to spatter perfume on the inside of the group's breath masks during their preparations for the unpleasant-smelling trip up the waste flue. The former Antarian Ranger took point in their exploration of the building, putting her intrusion skills to use once more.

This time, she posed as part of a work crew for the shuttle, and actually had to help Tainer service it and the Hawkbat's Vigil as part of their cover. The other part of their pretense at being at the shuttle was stealing containers of recreational holos, which Sarkin arranged in order to make them look like black marketeers. Though their work crew cover was almost blown by the arrival of the real shuttle work crew, Sarkin helped Tainer bluff and fight his way past them, and then covered Donos's arrival as he joined Plague Group for their departure in the Wraiths' shuttle, Narra. Just before they left, Ekwesh made a surprise assault on the spaceport in order to distract security so several other members of Wraith Squadron could steal four TIE fighters for the rendezvous with Trigit. As he flew over, a laser cannon emplacement tracked him, but the Wraiths' sniper, Donos, took it down with a laser rifle. Sarkin then ventured out to cover his exfiltration back to Narra.

Though the Imperial refused to bring his personal Star Destroyer, Implacable, into the system, the Wraiths were able to engage two other ships of Trigit's. In the battle, Sarkin helped take down the shields of the Nebulon-B frigate Provocateur with her set of proton torpedoes.

Sarkin, like the rest of their squadmates, could see that Tainer was not as pleased by this turn of events as he should have been. She followed him back to his room and opened the locked door with a code she obtained from Thri'ag, confronting the morose Tainer about his behavior and his fears about being his father's son\u2014Tainer's father had been slain for cowardice.

Both of these attitudes would later change as a result of her Jedi training and her relationship with Kell Tainer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sarkin did have a sense of humor, enjoying jokes, funny stories, and pranks during her time with the Wraiths. However, she occasionally found Ton Phanan's flirting and other behavior she considered boyish off-putting. She also cared about the well-being of her fellow pilots, helping bring Myn Donos out of catatonia after the loss of his astromech and persuading Kell Tainer to remain in Starfighter Command even when he intended to resign. Her relationship with the latter initially involved Sarkin rebuffing his attraction in order to make him realize who she really was, despite her own attraction to him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although she initially hid her past from her squadmates, Wedge Antilles also considered her one of the more honest members of the Wraiths. She told Antilles about her history with Atton Repness when she heard that it might affect the squadron. Her commander believed her to be an honest spirit, and knew simply by her personality that she had not been in on Ton Phanan's plan to bring down Repness. Up until her outburst and beating of Thri'ag, Antilles also considered her to be the most emotionally stable of the Wraiths."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With no formal Jedi training, Sarkin was able to actively achieve a flow-state that allowed her to sense both the pain and the awareness of beings within the Binring Biomedical facilities. Sarkin experienced several pieces of insight from the Force that allowed her to break through to Myn Donos amidst his emotional crisis. Although she continued to practice her talent, Sarkin also still had not done any Force training or been actively pursuing the Jedi way when she sensed Nuro Tualin's attack on Han Solo and the Mon Remonda. She did eventually become a Jedi without ever receiving formal training from a Jedi Master, and passed on that heritage to her son."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aside from her Force talents, Sarkin was skilled at silent movement and intrusion due to her heritage as an Antarian Ranger. She was better at moving stealthily than even Wedge Antilles with all of his ground missions for the Rebel Alliance and New Republic. She was able to move with the wind, letting it cover any small sounds that she might make. When on ground missions, Sarkin was often chosen to take point for the group, and was regarded as one of the best infiltrators in Wraith Squadron. However, for the first few weeks of her tenure in Wraith Squadron, she consistently scored at the bottom of the unit in terms of piloting scores. Later in her life, though, she would be selected by the Jedi Order to participate in two high-value strike missions from the cockpit of a StealthX, flying alongside luminaries such as Luke Skywalker and Jaina Solo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character of Tyria Sarkin was originally created by Aaron Allston for his novels within the X-wing series: Wraith Squadron, Iron Fist and Solo Command.
