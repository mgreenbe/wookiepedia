Zahra and her fleet was tasked with destroying the Alliance Navy of the Rebel Alliance. Shortly after the Duel on Cloud City, Zahra and her assault group managed to track down Fourth Division while the secondary strike force attacked the Eighth Division simultaneously near Malastare and had an interdictor vessel available to them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eighth Division was destroyed by Zahra's other forces, while Fourth Division suffered ten percent casualties during the Battle at Rendezvous Point Delta-Three since it managed to escape, thanks to the arrival of the Millennium Falcon. After managing to relocate the Fourth Division along with the Seventh Division, Commander Zahra initially ordered her fleet's secondary strike force to attack the Seventh, despite them being closer to the Fourth. After suggestions by Lieutenant Gorr, Zahra relented and ordered the secondary strike force to attack the Fourth Division. By the time the strike force arrived, the Fourth Division had left the coordinates and were en route to the Seventh Division, which was under attack by Zahra and her first strike force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
