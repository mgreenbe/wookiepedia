While they successfully extracted the encrypted information, their activity was detected by the Imperials, and one of her team members was injured during the escape. The further Imperials responded by locking down Thella's transport with two squads of stormtroopers, and scouring the starport for her team members."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After all the trouble her team had gone through, Thella was determined to find a way off planet. She heard of a local infochant known as \"The Finder\" whom she hoped could aid them. While the rest of her team laid low in a hiding place, Thella took her first officer Huffreys, and approached the infochant in the renowned cantina, Lorana's Labyrinth. The infochant was actually a Twi'lek called Loh'khar, and to Thella's surprise, he already knew her predicament. In exchange for a copy of the data she had acquired, Loh'khar provided her with an Emdee medical droid, a decrypt unit for the coded information, and put her in contact with the smuggler Platt Okeefe who owed him a favor. Okeefe flew Thella and her team through the Imperial blockade of Kelada and onto the backwater planet Gelgelar in her ship the Last Chance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
