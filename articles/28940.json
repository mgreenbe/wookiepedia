They were also used by military commanders to help survey the terrain and the location of enemy units in the immediate area surrounding it. Communications arrays were more commonly used for interstellar communication all over the galaxy. The array itself used a substantial amount of power and required a standard base power generator to function. The company MicroThrust Processors manufactured communications arrays during the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
