The manuscript had been transferred from Kitel Phard to Coruscant twelve years prior, and during the New Republic advance on the latter planet, the document disappeared during the evacuation of artifacts from the Imperial capital.

Ultimately, The Essential Atlas overrode the Voyages SF 13 placement by establishing that the Atrisi system was situated outside of the Expansion Region in which the Harron sector was later placed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When writing The Essential Atlas, the authors Daniel Wallace and Jason Fry placed the planet Atrisia and a part of the Atrisian Commonwealth in the Core Worlds region of the galaxy due to previously published sources noting the planet's antiquity and its cultural importance to the wider galaxy. However, they also placed it on the very frontier of that region, near the border of the explored galactic territories. This was done intentionally to make Atrisia seem a more exotic location and to provide the authors of future Star Wars media with interesting storytelling possibilities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
