The company became notorious for leading hunting parties in pursuit of Barabels on the planet Barab I. Although the Barabels were obviously an intelligent race, the hunting of them brought in a steady cash flow and the company was loathe to recognize them as such. However, as the Barabels began fighting back against the hunting parties, the Empire was forced to mount an investigation of Planetary Safaris dealings. Captain Osted Alater was sent to Barab I to investigate the danger of the Barabels to Imperial rule. While there, he discovered that the Barabels were sentient beings and had Planetary Safaris shut down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
