Typho went out of his way to protect his family whilst ensuring that food would be provided to the children within the camp. Upon finding a working transmitter, Typho assigned shifts to retain communications with the outside. While taking his turn during one of those shifts, he received word that the Queen of Naboo had arrived, opening the doorway for effective resistance to the Trade Federation. Gregar then began preparations for the oncoming fight.

In response, loyalist elements led by Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine had introduced legislation to create a Grand Army of the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to Amidala's high profile, the Senator and Captain Typho had traveled to Coruscant disguised as starfighter pilots. Due to his grim duty, Typho enlisted Cord\u00e9, one of Amidala's handmaidens, to pose as Amidala and travel on her diplomatic barge. This ruse enabled Amidala to escape an assassination attempt which claimed the life of her decoy and several members of her entourage.

That night, as Typho and his men guarded downstairs, a second assassination attempt against Amidala by the Clawdite assassin Zam Wesell involving two poisonous kouhuns was foiled by Skywalker and Kenobi. As a result, Amidala returned to Naboo accompanied by Skywalker. Following these events, Typho remained on Coruscant to protect the Gungan Representative Jar Jar Binks, who took Amidala's place on the Senate.

Before he could proceed, Binks accidentally destroyed the droid by knocking over some shelves while trying to catch a slug-beetle. Despite this setback, Amidala and Binks deduced that the droid came from Naboo's Eastern swamps due to the presence of mud on its chassis and the slug-beetle, which Binks recognized as originating from those swamps. While Amidala and company traveled to the Eastern Swamps to investigate, Captain Typho and Threepio remained behind to examine the other battle droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While examining a B1 battle droid's head, Typho and C-3PO discovered a hologram of a Separatist scientist named Doctor Nuvo Vindi and quickly relayed this information to Amidala.

He and Organa then went to her quarters to stop Sing, only to be unable to open the door.
