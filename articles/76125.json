The Kilians, descendants of Core World Human settlers from before 1000 BBY, during one of the earlier periods of expansion in the Galactic Republic, had lost access to all Galactic-scale technology. Somehow lost by the wider Galactic society, Kilia IV had no contact with the Republic or its successor, the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Commoner Kilians lived at a medieval level of development, but the ruling nobles held on to a few remaining bits of their original science and machinery.
