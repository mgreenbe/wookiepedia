He fought alongside Kiel Charny in a battle on Ruusan. After the fight, he witnessed a duel between Githany and Charny, and then watched as Darovit murdered Charny and defected to the Sith.

The Jedi later helped Petja aim as he shot down Bouncers, many of whom had gone insane with the massive destruction of the battle and were spreading panic and fear throughout the army. When they killed Laa, a Bouncer who had befriended Rain, she used the Force in anger to snap the necks of the two men."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This Jedi's appearance was based on inker Raul Fernandez."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
