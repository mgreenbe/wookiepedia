They were fairly large, with white patterns on their wings that resembled eyes. The moths had two distinct stages: one of a worm and one of a moth. During both stages, they could eat synthplast, and after only two weeks of maturation did they metamorphose into the mature moth stage. They could cause mild damage with their sharp teeth, and could be killed by harsh atmospheres (those bred for Type I atmospheres could not survive in Type III or worse, for example)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
