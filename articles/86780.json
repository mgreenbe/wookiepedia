When attacking a cargo pad, the Partisans found assistance from the Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis, who was there in search for the Wookiee chieftain Tarfful.

After Gerrera's brief victory speech, he, Kosan and the Wookiee Choyyssyk gathered around Kestis. Gerrera offered the Jedi a place in the Partisans, which he refused, wishing not to walk away from his own mission.
