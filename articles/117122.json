Situated in one of the planet's hostile desert regions, Ronion was an isolated settlement, nestled within the protective confines of a bio-dome.

Without Republic aid, communities across Mandalore began to suffer from food shortages, leaving many of its inhabitants starving. Ronion was among the worst hit by these shortages. To remedy the dire situation, Prime Minister Almec of the New Mandalorian government took it upon himself to establish a black market trade network in secret, in order to get food to those in need."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amidst these black market deals, a mysterious individual known as \"Mera Mal\" contacted a group of smugglers, providing them with fifty cases of Corellian Run MultiMeals to be delivered to Ronion.

Upon reaching their destination, the crew of smugglers were met at the Ronion docks by landing pad manager Iak Wal, who hoped to convince the group to abandon their efforts and take their goods to Sundari instead for the promise of a significantly larger payout."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The city of Ronion was first introduced to Star Wars canon in the roleplaying game sourcebook Collapse of the Republic, published June 28, 2019 by Fantasy Flight Games."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
