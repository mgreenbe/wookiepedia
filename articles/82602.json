Around 67 BBY, he and his Jedi Master, Ni-Cada, were sent by the Order to the world of Abraxin to investigate the continuous killing of marsh haunts, which were being carried out by the Force-sensitive Nautolan Naat Lare. On the planet the Jedi unknowingly crossed paths with the Muun Sith Lord Darth Plagueis, who was also looking for Lare. After Plagueis managed to make contact with Lare, the Muun convinced him into taking the offense against the Jedi as proof of his worthiness to join the Sith; the resulting skirmish was short, in which Bukk's Master killed Lare."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lo Bukk was a male Force-sensitive Zabrak Jedi Padawan of Master Ni-Cada who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic forty-five years before the Clone Wars, a series of conflicts fought between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. He and Ni-Cada were sent by the Order to the swampy planet Abraxin in the Tion Cluster, to investigate the continuous killing of non-sentient marsh haunts, who were red-eyed, gray-and-green-skinned creatures. The marsh haunt killings were committed by Naat Lare, a Force-sensitive Nautolan.

Both of them felt Plagueis' presence, though neither identified him as a Sith, an order of Force-sensitives who utilized the dark side of the Force. Later, as Bukk and his master emerged from an eatery bearing flagons of liquid, they unknowingly crossed paths with Darth Plagueis once again, and later talked with the Muun, who was also looking for Lare, as they sat at a table and discussed with the Muun about the recent killing of marsh haunts. Plagueis managed to make contact with Lare and convinced him into striking against the Bukk and his master as proof of Lare's worthiness to join the Sith.
