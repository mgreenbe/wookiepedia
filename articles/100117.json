In such an exercise, a cadet would be placed in command of a platoon of stormtroopers as a cadet leader and sent into actual combat to ascertain the cadet's resolve under fire. The senior officer's report and opinion was important for the final score. A satisfactory score was required to graduate the Academy; those who failed to gain such a score in their Omega Exercise would be flushed out of the Academy and sent to serve as an enlisted soldier."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kyle Katarn's Omega Exercise was the 1 BBY raid on AX-456."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
