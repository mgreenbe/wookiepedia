It fought against the New Republic corvette FarStar while in the Qu'mock system. The Scourge was defeated as the ship was unable to counter attacks from multiple fire arcs due to the design of the vessel's power generation system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fate of the Scourge is not explictedly stated.
