The Flier was being piloted by the Nightsister Lomi Plo and the Dark Jedi Welk. The two darksiders had stolen the ship from the Jedi Wookiee Lowbacca and Raynar Thul was still aboard when they took off. The three survived the collision, albeit with severe injuries, and started to establish their influence over the Killiks. Eventually, the crash site became something of a holy place for the Killiks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 35 ABY, Jacen Solo and Leia Organa Solo visited this place while searching for the Colony."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
