Davik spared no expense when it came to his own personal safety and his personal armor provided ample protection against blaster fire and basic melee weapons. It was often underestimated by the odd bounty hunter or assassin who engaged the crime boss in a confrontation that ended in the hapless opponent's death. It proved, however, to be of little use when Davik faced off against Revan and his companions as the many warships of the Sith blockade above Taris bombed the planet into submission. It afforded the wearer protection from extreme heat and cold, but hampered the Force abilities of any Force-sensitives who wore it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
