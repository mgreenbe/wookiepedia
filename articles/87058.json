Each one bore the heraldry of the noble's particular house, along with a tiny transmitter and receiver. When two marker rings from the same house would come in close contact, the transmitters would recognize each other and cause the rings to glow."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kilian Rangers who were also nobles would have a chevron denoting their rank as Rangers emblazoned on the ring as well. A bronze chevron indicated a Squire, a silver chevron identified a Ranger, and a gold chevron denoted a Kilian Lord. Also, many Kilian Rangers with marker rings would often turn them into Force Talismans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
