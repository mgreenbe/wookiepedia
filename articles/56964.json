The team was led by Jareth Sartoris and it made it's way onto the Star Destroyer through a docking shaft. They then split into two and Sartoris, Blandings, the Imperial Corrections Officers Austin and Vesek, and the engineer Blandings made their way to the Star Destroyer's maintenance level, where they found some parts. They then made their way back to the Purge, but all of the party, apart from Sartoris, had contracted a virus while on the Star Destroyer and Greeley began to feel ill.
