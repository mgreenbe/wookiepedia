Even under heavy enemy fire, the Great Swarm seldom broke formation or regroup, trusting their numbers would do them best with all due speed rather than using tactics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Battle of Tenupe, the Swarm lost millions of units, disbanding shortly after with the loss of Raynar Thul as their leader."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
