It had a dedicated generator so that it could work even if the ship's electrical system was down. The blaster cannon had a fire rate of 12 blasts per second and had a range of power settings from stun to armor-piercing. The cannon could be controlled manually or by the ship's computer, which would prevent it from hitting friendlies or parts of the ship itself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
