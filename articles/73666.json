After Vader executed his flagship's former commander, Admiral Kendal Ozzel, for incompetence during the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY, the Dark Lord promoted Captain Firmus Piett to admiral. In turn, the Executor's captaincy soon passed to Lieutenant Venka, whom Kallic eventually succeeded as captain of the Executor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the Hoth campaign, Kallic was given temporary command of the Executor at Vader's request while the Dark Lord returned to the Imperial capital planet of Coruscant. Emperor Palpatine had personally recalled Vader to make his report concerning his failed conversion of the Jedi Luke Skywalker to the dark side of the Force on Bespin's Cloud City. With Kallic escorting Vader to Coruscant, Admiral Piett remained with the Imperial Death Squadron, Vader's Star Destroyer fleet, to continue the Empire's hunt for the Rebel Alliance. Once Vader's business on Coruscant concluded, Kallic was scheduled to relinquish command of the Executor back to Piett."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Captain Kallic was created by author Peter Schweighofer for the short narrative Temporary Reassignment, published in the June 1996 Shadows of the Empire Sourcebook.

However, the 2002 The New Essential Guide to Characters and the 2008 The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia both stated that Kallic was Piett's immediate successor to captain, with Venka's involvement not taken into account.
