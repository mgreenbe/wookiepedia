Formerly a Padawan of the Jedi Order, his Master Aru-Wen was slain during the waning days of the Ruusan campaign in the New Sith Wars. After Aru-Wen's death during the final battle of the war on Ruusan, Harth was trained by Master Obba of the Council of First Knowledge. Obba's obsession in the research of Sith artifacts led to Harth's fascination with the Sith, and Harth fell to the dark side of the Force. Harth then abandoned the Order and moved to Nal Hutta, where he set up a mansion, as well as on other planets under his many disguises, to store all the dark side artifacts he could find."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 980 BBY, Harth recovered several artifacts that had been excavated on Doan.

Zannah went inside to confront her master, leaving Harth to guard their ship. However, Harth entered the prison and found the holocron of Darth Andeddu, which had been taken from Bane following the Dark Lord's capture. Harth then fled the prison, but not before briefly encountering his replacement, Darth Cognus, and began studying the method of transfer essence under the holocron's gatekeeper."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Life as a Jedi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Force-sensitive Human, Set Harth was inducted into the Jedi Order, training in the ways of the Force under the tutelage of Jedi Master Aru-Wen at the Coruscant Jedi Temple. When the Temple battlemaster, Jedi Lord Hoth, raised the Army of Light from among the holdings of the Jedi Lords spread across the galaxy, Harth's master departed Coruscant to join in the fighting. Harth joined him briefly, succumbing to his anger while battling a warrior of Lord Kaan's Brotherhood of Darkness. Due to Harth's violent tendencies, Aru-Wen ordered his Padawan to return to the Coruscant Temple while he traveled to Ruusan to join the Army of Light for the final showdown with Kaan. During the Seventh Battle of Ruusan, Kaan used a thought bomb on the Army of Light, killing exactly 100 members of it who were selected to go down with Lord Hoth, including Aru-Wen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following his Master's death on Ruusan, Harth came under the tutelage of Master Obba. Working with the Ithorian Jedi, Harth began working with the Council of First Knowledge in their endeavors to locate and confiscate all Sith artifacts scattered across the galaxy.

He forced a Rodian bartender, Quano, to take him to the miner who had dug up the artifacts, Draado. As Draado attempted to rally the miners to go to war with the Doan Royal House in retaliation of the recent assassination of their leader, Gelba, Harth ambushed them. The other miners were quickly killed, but Draado survived for a short time due to the help of the artifacts he wore.

The two traveled to Bane's home on Ciutric IV, where Zannah and Bane had been living, only to discover that Bane had been captured by the Royal Guard of the Doan Royal House.

After a fight in the hangar in which the Huntress was able to gain the upper hand, but before she could kill him, Serra\u2014 who was hoping to kill the two dueling Sith Lords\u2014set the Prison to self destruct. Harth then disabled two of the four ships in the hangar with his lightsaber and proposed to the Huntress that either they both should go free in their own ships or he would destroy both ships and they would be killed in the collapsing prison together. The Huntress accepted, allowing him to flee in his starship, taking the holocron with him.Soon after he began lessons from the holocrons gatekeeper on the dark side of the force, and the technique of essence transfer."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legendary explorer"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fearing Zannah would find him on Nal Hutta if she survived the Stone Prison's destruction, Harth knew better than to go back to his usual location. Since he had other bases under false identities, there was no need for him to run aimlessly across the galaxy. Having sole possession of Darth Andeddu's holocron, Harth was free to access the device and ply its storage banks for hidden knowledge.

Before turning his back on Darth Zannah, he realized his full potential when he could expand his awareness, due to some early part of his training under Obba.
