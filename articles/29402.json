It was a huge biped, stronger than the construction droid Mark I or construction droid foreman, but far less dexterous. It was used for heavy lifting that the smaller droids couldn't accomplish. A typical construction team consisted of one foreman, one Mark II, and multiple Mark I droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
