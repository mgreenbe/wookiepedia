Blair was the only survivor out of the resistance fighters who fought in the air at the Battle of Slotern. Blair and other resistance fighters were fighting in ancient starfighters against the Empire, when TIE fighters attacked their older craft. Only Blair and the Lieutenant's wingman were left after the initial attack by the TIEs. The assault was so sudden and shocking that Blair was unable to fire any weapons. The TIEs came back and shot and killed Blair's wingman, while badly damaging Blair's craft. Blair dove for the ground, and the automatic ejection activated on Blair's craft. Blair was the only survivor of the two-minute-long battle. The pilot later had an Eyewitness Report about the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Blair was first mentioned in the \"TIE fighter\" entry in the in-game databank of the PlayStation 3/Xbox 360 versions of the LucasArts video game Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, which was released on October 26, 2010."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
