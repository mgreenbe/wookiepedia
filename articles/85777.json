To get rid of some data that implicated them in dealing with the Consortium, Malbo and Tyri hired some agents to steal the data from a Consortium compound on the planet Nyriaan. To persuade the agents to go on the assignment, the Rangers claimed that they were on a deep cover operation to investigate the Consortium's criminal activities and that they required the data as evidence, to seal their case against the company."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Malbo and Tyri gave the agents some Joruba Consortium uniforms and sent them to board the Consortium CR90 corvette Windswept, which was en route to Nyriaan. The agents were to then steal some code cylinders from some Consortium troubleshooters who were aboard the starship, then use them to enter the Joruba Consortium branch office on Nyriaan, where they would slice into the computer system and recover the data. Malbo and Tyri then said that they would pick the agents up with the starship Last Call and leave Nyriaan, then pay the agents 15,000 credits for their services."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The agents agreed to go on the assignment and after Malbo and Tyri outfitted them with Joruba Consortium uniforms, left on the Windswept."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the course of their mission, the agents learned the real reason why Malbo and Tyri had sent them to recover the data, and bought proof of their corruption to the officer's superiors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
