During the Imperial Era, a skirmish broke out in the audience chamber after a group of criminals led by Kaluub Akjee, who had stolen the head of the assassin droid and bounty hunter IG-88, attempted to claim several bounties the droid possessed, which, unknown to the criminals, included the Underlord's son Venga Liss. During the skirmish, IG-88 called his starship, IG-2000, bringing himself a replacement body. After reattaching his head, IG-88 destroyed the remains of the Gillanium Syndicate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
