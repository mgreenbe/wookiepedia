He had held that position for almost twenty years, first under Rigis Corazon, then under his daughter Sabel Axis Corazon. He never forgave himself for failing to prevent Rigis's assassination. He loved Sabel as though she were his daughter, and this blinded him to her vengeful temper and questionable methods. He was a big, burly, quiet man who followed his instructions fanatically.
