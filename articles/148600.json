It was a simple design with a seat mounted above a small repulsor engine that provided both lift and thrust. It had 2 small lasers, but some models replaced one laser with a frag grenade launcher."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It never gained much popularity, and it was eventually superseded by the STAP.
