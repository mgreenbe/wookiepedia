It was capable of hyperspace travel and was popular with starship renters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The process of renting one of these ships was similar, in many ways, as with renting others. The rentor could pay for a fixed number of hyperspace jumps upfront. Upon reaching the last jump, the ship would automatically return to base. However, if a rentor attempted to override this programming or jump-tamper the nav-computer, they would face a hefty fine or be ordered to a weekend flying school with a tough Twi'lek instructor. There was also collision insurance and medical coverage available with the rental."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
