She supported the Alliance to Restore the Republic and their endeavors, who during 5 ABY had become known as the New Republic. While minding herself near a staffed control panel, a Rodian bounty hunter decided to lay a trap for Kyle Katarn, a man looking for the droid 8t88. The Rodian, who was hired by 8t88, was going to kill Katarn when he came close. When Katarn did eventually make his way to the woman's area, she attempted to warn Katarn of the impending attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Katarn avoided the Rodian's attacks, and subsequently killed him.

If the player was to kill her, they would stray to the Dark side of the Force. In addition, killing the Rodian is not vital to beating the game in any way. The fact that she was a Rebel sympathizer was revealed in the game's strategy guide, which was written by Rick Barba. This article assumes that the player does not kill the woman, but does kill the Rodian."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
