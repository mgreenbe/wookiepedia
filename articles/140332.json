It was regularly harvested to provide the inhabitants of Taris with food. The kelp forests were eventually almost entirely destroyed by increasing levels of toxic industrial pollution; this caused a planet-wide famine that led to the Tarisian Civil War and general decay of that planet. The remaining kelp, along with the remaining oceanic fauna, was later consumed to extinction by the Tarisian Nobels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
