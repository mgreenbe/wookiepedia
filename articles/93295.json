In the final decades of the Galactic Republic, the marketplace was big and busy, with many shops and market stalls where various types of fruits, meat and beverages could be bought."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The market was divided into several specialized quarters, some of which served the quotidian needs of the local inhabitants, while others housed engines mechanics, droid repairers or even illegal weapons dealers. Many vendors of the Mos Espa market placed cooling units near their products as a way of drawing potential customers from the hot, suffocating steets. Among the food shops found on the marketplace were Gragra's gorgmonger booth, Akim's Munch outdoor caf\u00e9 and Jira's fruits stall."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 32 BBY, the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn walked across the Mos Espa market, along with the Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala (in disguise) and a Gungan named Jar Jar Binks. Binks suddenly got hungry, and a market booth covered with gorgs for sale caught his eye. Sebulba, an angry Dug who was eating at a table nearby, started to bully the Gungan as revenge for the latter inadvertently ruining his soup by spitting the gorg out into the bowl. Only the timely intervention of the Human Anakin Skywalker saved Binks from being severely beaten or even killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
