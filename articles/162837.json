They believed that everyone had a right to be able to travel to space and so would do such things as fight pirates or help smugglers, who they believed were defying the tyrants of the spacelanes. They had no central organization and each Warden operated alone, patrolling spacelanes and watching out for travelers who needed help. From time to time, Wardens would encounter other Force-sensitive travelers and if the Warden believed they had potential, would approach such Force users and offer to take them as an apprentice. After completing training as an apprentice, the student would leave to patrol the spacelanes alone."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Wardens used subtle methods and would never reveal their true allegiance. They only acted in overt ways if it was truly necessary. They would walk among the crowds of the galaxy's spaceports, where they blended in, as they appeared to be just ordinary space travelers. Indeed many Wardens were. It was commonplace for Wardens to work on starships as pilots or navigators, as this gave them opportunities to patrol a section of space while appearing just to be an ordinary crew member."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Believing that firing blasters on board starships was dangerous, the Wardens were masters of unarmed combat. They developed a unique fighting style that involved a combination of Force techniques and martial arts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the Great Hyperspace War between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic, the Hyperspace Navigator's Guild, which had been responsible for monitoring the spacelanes, became discredited. A Force-sensitive hyperspace explorer began to patrol the spacelanes instead, to try and stop anyone who made intergalactic travel difficult for ordinary people. Eventually, he found and trained other Force-sensitives, and they became the first Wardens of the Sky."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over time, the Wardens came to be regarded as myth, told in cantinas by space pilots. This anonymity helped them to evade detection by the Sith and later, by the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
