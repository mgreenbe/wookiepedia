The Keeramak had no gender and had an abnormal size for a Ssi-Ruu. Its birth sent shock waves throughout the Ssi-Ruuvi Imperium and fulfilled a Ssi-Ruuk prophecy from the sacred text known as G'nnoch that one born with many colors would free the oppressed lower castes\u2014particularly the brown scaled Ssi-Ruuk, which were born from a union between two Ssi-Ruuk from different castes, and the lowly P'w'ecks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ssi-Ruuk adored the Keeramak and raised it like a king.

The Keeramak would deceive the Bakurans by telling them that the P'w'ecks had overthrown the Imperium and had come to sign a peace treaty with them. This plan however backfired when the P'w'eck Lwothin shot and killed the Keeramak and the P'w'ecks really did revolt, due to the Elder's Council accidentally predicting this very event. The body was sent back to Lwhekk after the battle, in an attempt to appease the Conclave, as well as agitate the Elders' Council.
