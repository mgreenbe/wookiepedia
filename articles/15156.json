There, a large army of Gungan troops who had likewise fled the city waited for him. As he arrived, a scout brought a report of a nearby Federation camp. OOM-9 commanded it and was nearby directing the landing of a droid transport ship, but was not present at the camp itself. Nass ordered the destruction of the camp, and his Gungan troops carried out the task quickly. They destroyed all the B1-Series battle droids at the site and razed the buildings with few casualties."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Arrival of the Naboo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boss Nass and the Gungans had no time to celebrate as Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala had just landed in the swamps along with Captain Quarsh Panaka, Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn, and their entourage. She asked for permission to journey to the Sacred Place. Boss Nass obliged them, and the Naboo group went through the swamps on foot. They battled many Trade Federation troops, who were sometimes already fighting members of the Resistance who had retreated into the swamps. At one point they were joined by two Naboo light scout frigates and an aquatic transport, which they used to sink a Federation Ocean Troop Transport and to travel up the swamp."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Along the way, the two Jedi fought through a large force of over 50 Federation battle droids in a dry riverbed, including one OOM-series command droid.

Nass agreed to join with her to free Naboo. The Naboo security volunteers waited for Captain Panaka's orders, as did several dozen members of the Naboo Underground. The Sith Lord Darth Maul secretly observed the proceedings using probe droids. In large part because of Jar Jar Bink's role in the unification between the Gungans and the Naboo, Nass, in addition to revoking Bink's exile, also promoted the Gungan to Bombad General, to Bink's horror. The Gungan composer Augara Jowil was present, and stunned by the events she had just witnessed, wrote the \"Symponik Nabooalla\" to commemorate the unification of the two peoples. The piece was later performed at the peace ceremony following the end of the war."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Queen's meeting with the Gungans first appeared in materials relating to Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace,released in 1999.

The game's strategy guide revealed ways through the mission. Defeating the battle droids is not the only option; many of them can be skipped. Beating the Gungan NPCs in the mission results in them running away, although it is possible to kill them permanently. Regardless, the player receives points for the action."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds showed the Gungans' retreat to the Sacred Place. The game's strategy guide detailed the best way to pass the mission. The guide recommended leading Nass and company slowly toward the sacred place to avoid one of the creatures. After the Federation outpost was destroyed, the game switches perspective and controls to that of the Queen and her escorts. Two Naboo repeater troopers replace the pilots and guards seen in the movie. The guide recommends sending Jinn and Kenobi ahead to deal with ambushes, then retreating to heal their hitpoints. The game ends if any of the named \"hero\" characters die. Using a cheat code to show the entirety of the map shows OOM-9 in the corner with a landing craft."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
