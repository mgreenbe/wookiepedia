Despite her position on the committee, Dio was outspoken in criticizing the Galactic Senate's expanded powers, and strongly opposed the Military Creation Act. After the Battle of Duro in 20 BBY, however, Dio was assassinated, and Mal\u00e9-Dee was elected to take her place."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was believed by his constituents that Mal\u00e9-Dee would be less outspoken than his predecessor, and would take her place on the Loyalist Committee. Mal\u00e9-Dee proved them wrong, however, and he too grew suspicious over Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's growing power over the Senate. Near the end of the war, Mal\u00e9-Dee joined the Delegation of 2000, which presented Palpatine with the Petition of 2000; this document called for the Supreme Chancellor to relinquish his burgeoned powers at the war's conclusion, and denounced the renewed position of Moff.
