Moments later, Luminara holographically calls them, reporting that she has found what seemed to be a munitions container. She is advised by Obi-Wan via hologram to wait for support. Suddenly, after Buzz pushes a rock that shows a hole into the catacombs beneath, he is heard screaming and contact with Luminara is lost.

She contacts Obi-Wan, telling them not to enter the temple, before she is subdued. Then, Obi-Wan and Anakin are attacked by the undead Geonosians, who are able to move even if shot or hacked; there is also something worm-like moving through their face openings. They manage to save themselves by going down a tunnel. Obi-Wan remembers rumors of a hive mind able to control Geonosians, even after they are dead. Because they are too deep underground to contact Mundi, Obi-Wan sends two clones to head back to the surface and call for help. Unfortunately, they are killed by the zombies before they can do so. Obi-Wan thus suggests that the rest of them should stick together."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They eventually find Luminara, held in energy bonds before the Geonosian Queen, Karina The Great. Anakin prepares to charge in, but Obi-Wan has a different strategy. He tells Cody to have his men surround the place, and wait for his signal to blind the zombies and bury them. The Jedi approach the queen, her thralls letting them pass. Obi-Wan diplomatically tells her to surrender, but the queen refuses, intending on controlling the Jedi with her brain worm, catching Obi Wan's interest about the way the queen's mind control works. Poggle the Lesser approaches Luminara with a worm, but before it can snake its way up her nose, Obi-Wan gives the signal, and Cody and his men surprise the Geonosians, projecting light on the zombies and confusing them. They save Luminara and take Poggle prisoner. The undead tried to pursue the Jedi and the clones, but the clones blast the cave supports, causing the ceiling of the cave to collapse. Obi-Wan intends to study the worm that was going to be used on Luminara, but Anakin squishes it with his boot, saying they should get out. They attempt to escape the collapsing temple, with the zombies after them. As they make their way up the hole that leads to the surface, a few zombies follow. Then, a rush of dust, and air pushes them up. They escape before the entire temple caves in, probably burying the queen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though developed completely independently, this is the second zombie story in Star Wars.
