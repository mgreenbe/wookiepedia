Non-sentient, tarvixes moved on four limbs through the forest canopy nimbly, if not relatively slowly. Domesticated by the Sathari as riding beasts, these creatures had a thick, bristly coat to protect against the bearsloth. Four red eyes were situated amid the squat head of the tarvix, though they relied on sense of smell to navigate the forest floors and canopy alike. Their mouths were filled with sharp fangs used for tearing meat of prey."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
