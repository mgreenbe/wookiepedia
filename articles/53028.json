She had begun to siphon off more and more power for herself, and Bel Iblis suspected that, should they manage to overthrow Emperor Palpatine, Mothma would take his place. Bel Iblis stayed with the Rebellion for several months, losing many friends and finding his name on an Imperial arrest list."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, Mothma gave the go-ahead for an Alliance attack on an Imperial garrison at Milvayne in the Gyrica system without seeking the approval of Bel Iblis or any of her other military advisors. Before the attack was enacted, Bel Iblis called Mothma out for her actions at an Alliance conference, requesting that she postpone and reconsider the attack. Mothma overruled him, but a livid Bel Iblis questioned her motives in ordering the attack, claiming it was simply part of a grab for power on her part. The two traded thinly-veiled insults, with Bel Iblis eventually stating that none of his troops would have a part in the attack. He felt that Mothma's Intelligence was flawed, as his own sources informed him it was in fact a heavily fortified Imperial Ubiqtorate base, which his men would be unable to deal with. For his dissent, Mothma told Bel Iblis that the Rebellion no longer required his services. He stormed out of the chamber and took his loyal supporters, including Sena Leikvold Midanyl and another aide, Irenez, away from the Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using a mobile base named Peregrine's Nest, Bel Iblis and his followers scored several vital victories against the Galactic Empire, but were seen as less principled than the main Rebellion. Their biggest triumph occurred in 2 ABY with a successful attack on the Ubiqtorate base on Tangrene. Bel Iblis used all of the five Dreadnaught-class heavy cruisers his movement had at the time in the attack and all five returned to Peregrine's Nest in the aftermath"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Military power"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bel Iblis was able to gather a sizable force over the nine years in his movements existence consisting of both a naval and ground force. The naval consisted of six Dreadnaught-class heavy cruisers including the Peregrine and the Harrier. These ships were part of the Katana fleet and later purchased from the smuggler Captain Hoffner. These six cruisers were each crewed by two thousand soldiers, making an approximate total of his navy's crew over twelve thousand."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bel Iblis's ground forces were equipped with Golan Arms anti-infantry turrets, Speizoc Arms anti-vehicle turrets and KAAC Freerunner assault vehicles. It may have also had a Kuat Drive Yards v-150 Planet Defender ion cannon as a control panel for such a device was present in the command center of the Peregrine's Nest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
