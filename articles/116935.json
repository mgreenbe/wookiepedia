After the Eternal Empire conquest of 3636 BBY, a Star Fortress was placed in orbit of Voss by the Eternal Empire of Zakuul. The Gormak saw the Star Fortress as a source of the disease that affected their young, old and weak. In 3631 BBY the off-worlder who killed his brothers - now the Commander of the Alliance arrived on Voss to take out the Star Fortress shield bunker. Rokuss recognized that the off-worlder who killed his kin had the most chance of destroying the Star Fortress and offered his assistance.
