Early on in the Clone Wars, the Jedi became increasingly desperate to capture the commander of the Separatist droid army, General Grievous. After a battle occurred above the planet of Saleucami, he was forced to jettison from his ship in an escape pod, landing on the planet's surface. In an attempt to capture the general for good, Obi-Wan Kenobi gathered a group of clone troopers, including Kix, in order to follow them. The clones eventually discovered the wreckage of the ship, with CC-2224, \"Cody,\" noting and subsequently reporting to Kenobi that it had crashed recently. Kenobi then decided it would be best to split the group up into two teams, and left CT-7567, \"Rex,\" along with Kix, CT-5597 \"Jesse,\" and Hardcase to search for the other missing escape pods, while he, Cody and Crys stayed behind to further investigate the crashed ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each mounting their own BARC speeders, Kix's team searched through the wetlands of the planet for the remaining escape pods. Unbeknownst to them, two commando droids were watching them from afar, and utilizing a sniper rifle, shot at Rex, instantly knocking his off his speeder. Being their medic, Kix immediately swerved backwards to protect the unconscious captain, while Jesse and Hardcase followed the snipers. While Jesse and Hardcase destroyed the commando droids, Kix began examining his injuries, discovering that Rex was still alive, but it was severe and he had been shot 2 inches away from his heart. Deciding there was no way to continue their mission in the state they were in, they concluded that they were going to need to find some cover for the time being. Noting a domesticated eopie standing behind them, he established that they were on farmland and so the group set off to find the farmer's homestead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon discovering a nearby homestead, they were greeted anxiously by a female Twi'lek, Suu Lawquane, who proceeded to point her rifle at them.

Suu gave them permission to stay and allowed them to do so in the barn. Once inside, Kix patched up Rex's wound with a bacta bandage allowing for him to regain consciousness shortly after. As he awoke, Jesse and Hardcase informed him of what had ensued. Much to Rex's dismay, Kix told him he was in no condition to fight and continue their mission, and that he must have some rest. Not wanting to put the mission in jeopardy, Rex decided to give the responsibility of leading the group to Jesse. Kenobi then contacted the group through comlink, with Jesse responding and letting him know that Rex had been injured, and the group was now his responsibility. Kenobi then informed him that Grievous was heading for an abandoned, but still working escape pod, and ordered them to drive westward, so that could trap the general between the two squads."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, Jesse contacted Kenobi, telling him that he had a clear visual of the escape pod, and that Grievous had already arrived.

As it began coming closer, the All Terrain Tactical Enforcer's guns overheated, and so Kenobi rushed to engage Grievous one on one. They dueled very briefly, before the shuttle came low enough to the ground for Grievous to fire a tow cable at it, managing to escape with the ship.

As gunships began transporting troops down to the ground, the battle began, with Kix and the rest of the 501st fighting off and intercepting Umbaran forces north of the capital city. The enemy forces proved relentless in their efforts, and the 501st took heavy casualties despite gaining new ground. Eventually, the clone pilot CC-2237 \"Odd Ball,\" along with his team of Y-wing bombers, were able to drop munitions over a ridge, eliminating all Umbarans in the area and putting the battle on hold. It was during this time that General Pong Krell arrived, who had also been involved with the assault. Upon landing, he informed Skywalker that he had been ordered back to Coruscant without delay, adding that he, Krell, would resume command of the 501st for the remainder of the Umbaran campaign.

The men trekked across the rough Umbaran terrain for 12 hours straight, which led Kix to worry for his brothers' increasing fatigue. Kix voiced his concerns to Rex, who suggested that the group make camp on a nearby ridge. The suggestion mortified Krell, who announced to the clones that rest was a luxury the Republic did not have, and that they would continue walking. The clones eventually made it to the capital, where Krell immediately briefed them with new orders. The clones were to scrap Skywalker's initial plan to surprise attack the Umbarans, and were to instead launch a full-frontal assault\u2014one that would endure high casualties. Rex did not agree with this plan; however, they followed through with the order.

Kix was able to save as many of the injured as he could, calling for cover from Rex, Dogma, and Jesse as he administered temporary stimulants to the fallen troopers. In the midst of the battle, Krell received word from General Kenobi that he was unable to capture the capital, and would require the 501st to capture an Umbaran Airbase. Krell obliged, and after the Umbaran forces were fought off, they set off for the airbase. Many of the troops\u2014including Kix, Jesse, CT-5385 \"Tup,\" and CT-5555 \"Fives\"\u2014objected to Krell's tactics, and though Rex attempted to defend them, the clones were still not at ease. Rex then split the 501st into two separate groups. Rex was to lead his division along the outskirts of the canyon while Fives took his division\u2014which included Kix\u2014through the other side of the gorge. Fives' division were the first to meet Umbaran resistance, in the form of an Impeding Assault Tank.

Clearly angered by this, he immediately sprung towards them, shooting and killing the flying vermin. Rex then ordered Kix to leave them and to continue walking.

Rex contacted Krell about the impending threat, requesting immediate backup; this was denied. Krell ordered that the clones must press on with the attack. Forced to obey, Rex mobilized the remaining men, and directed Kix to keep the wounded as quiet as possible. As expected, their weapons were little match for the heavy cannon, and the 501st quickly sustained egregious losses. In the turmoil, Kix requested help in getting the wounded to safety, to which Rex quickly came to assist. Just as Kix went to rescue more of the injured, Rex told the clone medic he would have to leave them behind. Kix strongly disagreed with his sentiment, stating that they couldn't simply leave the men behind, to which Rex told him that it was more important to save himself in the given situation, and if they survived, he would be able to patch up the wounded later. Kix remarked that Rex sounded just like General Krell. Seeing no other way out, Rex ordered Fives and Hardcase to go behind enemy lines to steal two of the enemy's starfighters to provide some air support.

Regardless of this fact, General Krell decided against destroying the ship, and instead ordered the clones to continue closing in on the capital. Many of the clones once again disagreed with Krell's strategy, most notably Fives who suggested they should use the stolen Umbaran starfighters to destroy the supply ship. Rex then proposed the new plan to Krell, who felt it was a waste of time, stating that the attack on the capital would still be commencing. Outraged by this, Fives decided to take matters into his own hands, defying the general by gathering together Hardcase and Jesse to help him out with his mission. Kix supported this, and helped prepare the starfighters for the impending attack on the supply ship. Fives, Jesse and Hardcase then proceeded on with their plan, without the knowledge on General Krell. They ended up being successful with their mission, managing to sneak behind enemy lines, and with Hardcase sacrificing himself to manually the destroy the ship.

Dogma was shocked by this, telling the clones that they must follow through with their orders. Rex sarcastically wished him good luck in trying to find someone else willing to do it. Krell then called for both Rex and Dogma to report to him why they had failed to carry out the execution. As Rex and Krell bickered, they received a transmission from a clone, who claimed that the Umbarans had attacked them, stealing their weapons and armor. Krell then decided it was best for the clones to launch an attack now while they still could, reminding Rex to tell the troops that the Umbarans would be wearing clone armor. The 501st immediately moved to engage in battle; they were promptly sprayed down with enemy fire. Kix, using his night vision filters, saw that the opposing soldiers were wearing 212th armor and concluded that they were disguised Umbarans, just as Krell had cautioned. The battle commenced for a short while before Rex realized that the enemies were not in fact Umbarans in disguise, but were actually their own brothers in the 212th Legion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rex began to frantically run across the battlefield with his helmet removed, screaming that they were all clones and to cease fire. Upon realization, members of both the 501st and the 212th Legions were shocked, all of them removing their helmets and looking at each other in disbelief. Kix was quick to locate the platoon leader, Waxer, who had been mortally wounded. He called Rex over to discover how the two clone legions ended up attacking each other. Kix tended to his injuries, as the shell-shocked Waxer informed them of how his men were notified that the enemy were wearing their armor and were ordered to attack by General Krell. A tear shed from Waxer's eye as he died from his injuries. Rex gathered a group of men, including Kix and Tup, and suggest that they arrest Krell for treason against the Republic. Back at the airbase, Kix, Tup, and Rex freed Fives and Jesse from their cell and gathered more men to storm the command center. The clones then confronted Krell about his recent actions, to which he activated his double-bladed lightsabers and instantly sliced through many clones.

Tup then shot the vixus, killing it, causing Krell to be hurled to the ground, where the clone then proceeded to stun him. Krell was taken to the same prison block that he had imprisoned Jesse and Fives in not too long before. There, he revealed he had been plotting with the Separatists since the beginning, taunting them that they had all been foolish. The clones soon received word that an attack from the Umbarans was inevitable, so Rex made the uneasy decision that it was best to execute Krell so that he could not escape via the Umbaran attack. Rex, Jesse, Fives, Tup, and Dogma then re-entered the prison block, where Rex prepared to execute the rogue Jedi. Krell tormented Rex, knowing that he would not be able to execute a Jedi master; however, Besalisk traitor was suddenly shot by his most loyal trooper, Dogma.

They soon realized that the colony was extremely quiet, noting that nobody had seen a single colonist at all, leaving Rex to theorize that the Separatists could potentially be using them as living shields. As they made for the city center they encountered a group of commando droids, who lead them into an Armored Assault Tank along with several other B1-series battle droids. And after a small skirmish, they were able to defeat them, with Kenobi then ordering the city center and the governors' tower to be secured.

Kenobi said that if he were to surrender, the Zygerrian would first have to release the colonists that the Separatists had clearly kidnapped, to which D'Nar responded with a counteroffer, as he set off one of the bombs. The explosion had been set off next to the Republic forces back on the ground, leaving many clones injured. Skywalker called for a medic to treat a particularly wounded clone, to which Kix immediately ran over to help.

Upon securing a safe location, they attempted to determine why Tup had mercilessly murdered a commander in cold blood. Taking the volatile clone to the side, Rex noted that he had believed Tup had simply snapped, as he began spontaneously repeating that \"good soldiers follow orders.\" As the medic, Kix began assessing Tup and waved his hand in front of the clone's face.

As a result of his brash reaction, the medical droid was forced to sedate him. Skywalker then asked Kix if he had checked all of Tup's medical scans, to which he replied that from his knowledge, it appeared to be a combat-related stress and that he had broken down. Rex and Fives were not convinced however, noting that they as clones were engineered to withstand it. They then quizzed that it could have been the work of biological warfare, and that the enemy had drugged him into killing the Jedi.

He pleaded that he needed to make contact with Rex or Skywalker immediately, to which Kix gave the advice that Fives should turn himself in. Fives exclaimed that Kix simply didn't understand, and that he had been involved in such a conspiracy that reached the highest levels of the Republic.

During the campaign, the Republic forces were initially losing repeatedly, and the Separatists emerged on the verge of victory. Suspicious, Rex and Cody met with Jedi Generals Skywalker and Mace Windu. Rex theorized that the Separatists had learned his personal combat strategy, and, based on the tactics used by himself and the Separatists, secretly thought that CT-1409 \"Echo,\" an ARC trooper thought to have been killed during the Battle of Lola Sayu, was still alive.

Upon climbing out, Kix noticed that Cody had been left trapped underneath part of the rubble from the gunship and called for help. Bad Batch member, Wrecker volunteered to rescue him alone, much to Kix's discontent who believed that he would need help in doing so. Wrecker was able to lift the gunship with ease, picking up Cody's injured body, as the ship burst into flames behind him.

He took great concern for Rex's health, and advised Jesse and Hardcase that in order to see the full extent of Rex's injury, he had to remove pieces of Rex's armor. After Rex handed the leading position to Jesse, Kix cooperated with Jesse's orders that were given to himself and Hardcase.
