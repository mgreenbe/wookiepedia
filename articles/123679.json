The introduction of the character Chak Fel in Survivor's Quest in 2004 created a continuity error by adding a sixth Fel child when five Fel children \u2014 five having been established as the total number of Fel children \u2014 had already been identified. As Davin Fel was the only Fel child of similar age to Chak, Lucas Licensing editor Sue Rostoni initially suggested that Chak was in fact Davin, with Chak being a nickname. This suggestion was ultimately not integrated into canon, with Dark Nest I: The Joiner King introducing the \"shadow child\" custom as an explanation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While it may be that \"shadow children\" were a true Chiss custom, it is also possible that the explanation was supplied as misinformation to disguise the true reason for this discrepancy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
