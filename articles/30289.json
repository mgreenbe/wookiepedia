Each unit was self-contained, and most contained their own supply of emergency gear and supplies since they were intended to be used in harsh environments. They could be carried by medium freighters and were very easy to connect to each other to form a variety of structures. Units could be used for living quarters, research, storage, or command centers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
