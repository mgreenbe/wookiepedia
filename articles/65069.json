Physically similar in design to the S-1 FireHawke Heavy Repulsortank rather than its Imperial-class predecessor, the Mark II was capable of reaching speeds of 400 kilometers an hour. It was armed with a heavy laser cannon with maximum range of five kilometers, and a medium laser cannon with a maximum range of one kilometer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
