When the Senate Guard expanded from a bodyguard detail to becoming a full law enforcement agency, many recruits were drawn to the Senate Guard Academy from the Coruscant Security Force police academies. This caused friction between the Guard and the CSF which was further compounded when the Senate Guard took charge of policing the Legislative District. The power struggle between the CSF and the Senate Guard would last till the end of the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
