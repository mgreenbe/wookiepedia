The Coral Banks were a popular haunt for the Alanciari harvester fleet. During Quarra Thayn's visit to Point Defiance, her host and lover Jogan Halder suggested taking her on a rowboat to the Coral Banks on the following morning. This trip never occurred due to the Lost Tribe of Sith's invasion of Alanciar that very night."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
