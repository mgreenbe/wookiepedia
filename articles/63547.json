The term originated from an incident that occurred around the year 3743 BBY, when a hunter named Riegenn Hetuu was hired by a Hutt to capture a live k'lor'slug queen. Hetuu had not taken the creature's high reproductive rate into account, and a hoard of nearly four hundred k'lor'slugs hatched in his ship's cargo bay by the time he arrived on the planet Hutta. When he opened the cargo bay to show his client his prize, the released k'lor'slugs devoured both Hetuu and his Hutt client. The term was still used around the year 3643 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The term \"Hutt's cry\" was first mentioned in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a 2011 MMORPG produced by BioWare.
