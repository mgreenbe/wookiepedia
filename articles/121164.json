Quick and nimble, scrap rats inhabited the planet's vast junkyards and could often be found scurrying through the pipes of downed starships. They created nests out of wire and cables where they raised their young. Signs were posted around the scrapyards instructing people to not feed the scrap rats."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 14 BBY, several scrap rats scurried past the rigger and former Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis as he traveled through the remains of a Venator-class Star Destroyer.
