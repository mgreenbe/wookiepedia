After entering intense negotiations with the Tarasin, CreedCon gained the rights to build a race course deep in the jungles of Cularin. They began construction, but a group of its workers were captured by the Dark Jedi Raik Muun. Creed sent out a security team to find the missing workers, but they too went missing, after being captured by a group of battle droids that served Muun. Creed then summoned the Heroes of Cularin, a group of freelance agents that operated in the Cularin system, to the Hedrett office, so that he could send them to find the missing workers. The heroes found and brought back the security, and later found the workers on Tilnes, where Muun had taken them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
