During the Galactic Civil War, Anaxes served as the fleet's main command center. Like all other forces in Sector Zero, Azure Hammer Command was controlled by Grand Admiral Osvald Teshik, until he lost his command due to his failure to deal with the Rebel privateer Far Orbit, shortly after the Battle of Yavin. Even after the Grand Admiral's removal, Anaxes managed to stave off the New Republic for many years, but a few months prior to the Thrawn Crisis, Admiral Osted Wermis surrendered the command's headquarters to the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
