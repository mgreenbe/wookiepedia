Her scars were due to an allergic reaction to bacta, keeping her from recovering fully and forcing her into a self-imposed exilement from the Hapes Consortium. She would go on to become a mercenary and serve on board the Poison Moon as a sensor officer and served under Dician who, unbeknownst to her, was a Sith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
