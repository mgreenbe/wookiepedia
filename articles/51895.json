The barrier prevented exploration of the Unknown Regions, save for a few worlds which could be reached with cautious hyperspace jumps, including Csilla, Ilum, and Rakata Prime. The ancient Sith and Jedi discovered ways to navigate the anomalies, but their methods were lost to time, with routes only left in artifacts such as Sith wayfinders and a Jedi star compass retrieved by Luke Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
