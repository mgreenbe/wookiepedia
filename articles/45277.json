Pursued by Yuuzhan Vong agents through the passenger liner, C-3PO hid with the infant in Escape Bay 14 while he waited for rescue. When Viqi Shesh, a New Republic senator who was collaborating with the Yuuzhan Vong, spotted C-3PO, the droid hid Skywalker in a locker and rushed to one of the bay's escape pods. From inside the escape pod he used his functions as a protocol droid to mimic the sound of a Human baby crying, causing Shesh and the Yuuzhan Vong to rush into the escape pod. Once the senator and the Yuuzhan Vong were inside, C-3PO was forced back out into the bay, whereupon he launched the escape pod and retrieved Skywalker from the locker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
