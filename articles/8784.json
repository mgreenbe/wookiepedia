It was a relatively small, compact, 9.19 meter long tank, and consisted of a heavily armored, spade-shaped lower hull topped with a lighter, secondary hull and rotating turret. It was operated by a crew of four, one B1 pilot battle droid, two gunners, and one commander, which could differ between an OOM command battle droid, tactical droid, or even an organic, and could carry up to six additional droids via handholds and footholds on the hull, as well as ten metric tons. The AAT-1, due to its heavy armor, was neither quick nor agile on the battlefield, boasting a maximum speed of 55 kilometers per hour. The cost of the AAT-1 was 75,000 credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The AAT-1 was an extremely versatile vehicle designed to handle nearly any opposition encountered on the battlefield. Its primary weapon was a heavy laser cannon mounted in the top turret that provided the tank with 360 degrees of long-range firepower powerful enough to destroy an All Terrain Tactical Enforcer of the Grand Army of the Republic. Two medium laser cannons, mounted on the tank's port and starboard sides, provided excellent anti-vehicle firepower, and a pair of coxial heavy blasters were mounted with the lasers for anti-personnel work. It was also armed with six-barreled multiordnance projectile launchers that were mounted in the lower hull, which gave the AAT-1 anti-armor and even siege capabilities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While formidable in theory, in practice, the AAT-1 was less than the sum of its parts. Its biggest weakness was the crew, the quartet of B1-series battle droids, and while competent, the droid crew possessed neither the initiative nor the ability to improvise that of a crew of sentients would have. This made them predictable and easily countered by opponents who have tangled with the tank before. In addition, their computer and electrical systems left much to be desired, and a platoon of AAT-1s could easily be taken out by a handful of electromagnetic pulse grenades. Despite such shortcomings, the tanks did pose a considerable threat to clone trooper infantry and armored forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The AAT was designed for and used in the Trade Federation's Invasion of Naboo. The AAT was later donated to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, where it served as one of its backbone infantry defenses and backbone vehicles during the Clone Wars. Many of the AATs used by the Confederacy were painted in Confederate colors, such as blue, though there were still tanks used by the CIS in the previous tan used by the Trade Federation. The tanks were also donated to Death Watch during their alliance with the Confederacy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the most famous variants of the vehicle was done by Confederate General Lok Durd. He modified one of these into the Defoliator Deployment Tank. He attempted to test the vehicle on Maridun and the Lurmen there. However his prototype was destroyed by Anakin Skywalker and several others. This variant of the tank was later used by the Supreme Commander of the Droid Army, General Grievous, on Dathomir."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Clone Wars, dozens of AATs fell into the hands of the Alliance to Restore the Republic where they were modified extensively in order to better accommodate organic crews."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Galactic Empire's assault tank bore a resemblance to the Armored Assault Tank."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
