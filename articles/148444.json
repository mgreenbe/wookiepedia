Around the time of the Jedi Civil War, the planet negotiated with the Czerka Corporation to gain slaving rights to Wookiees, beginning a millennia-long struggle between the Wookiees and the Trandoshans. After the Wookiees' revolted against the corporation, with the assistance of the Ebon Hawk crew, Czerka was forced to withdraw from Kashyyyk, eventually Trandosha and ultimately from the system altogether."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the end of the New Sith Wars, it was the site of the Battle of Hsskhor, where the Trandoshans launched a surprise attack on both the Republic and the Sith when they retreated to their camps to rest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 23 BBY, a Wookiee vessel was attacked over a moon of Trandosha, resulting in a Wookiee blockade of Trandosha.

The two species had never seen eye to eye, and their relationship was, at best, lukewarm at the outbreak of the Clone Wars due to a number of factors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though never committed to the Separatist cause in a public forum, a number of independent Trandoshan organizations joined forces with the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. Pirate bands, slavers, and pro-Trandoshan terrorist groups participated in many Separatist actions, particularly those that took place on the Wookiee homeworld prior to the Battle of Kashyyyk. In truth many of these groups had indirect financial backing from Trandosha itself, as the planetary government was only too happy to direct its own attacks upon Wookiees from the shadows."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire initiated a blockade of Kashyyyk, most of the system's commerce began to flow through Trandosha, giving the planet an economical boost.
