They were the size of a small humanoid, had an armor-like chitinous exoskeleton, two sets of wings, and venomous stingers. They were eusocial insects who lived in towering communal hives, and they were aggressive toward intruders. Apidactyls secreted a heavy gold wax with which they built the hexagonal, thin-walled cells of their hives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the New Republic built treatment centers for injured troopers on Vashka, most of planet's megafauna was cleared out to ensure the safety of its new inhabitants.
