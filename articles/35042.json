She was recruited to fight for the Jedi's Army of Light during the Ruusan campaign of the New Sith Wars but, after arriving on Ruusan, was separated from the group during a Sith attack and presumed dead. Unbeknownst to the Jedi, she had been saved and befriended by a member of the native Bouncer species called Laa. When the Brotherhood of Darkness later unleashed a planet-wide Force storm, Rain survived by instinctively enveloping herself and Laa with a bubble of Force energy. Not long afterward, the young girl watched as Laa was haplessly killed by Jedi scouts. Stricken with anger and grief, she unwittingly gave in to the dark side and murdered the Jedi. Her display of rage attracted the attention of the war's only surviving Dark Lord, Darth Bane, who decided to take her as his apprentice. Rain cast away the handle of her youth and instead embraced her birth name, becoming Darth Zannah."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zannah's preliminary Force training took place on the planet Ambria and involved the study of ancient Sith magic. In her tutelage under Darth Bane, Zannah executed a variety of missions designed to incite anarchist movements throughout the Galactic Republic, including manipulating the terrorist Anti-Republic Liberation Front into a botched kidnapping attempt on former Supreme Chancellor Tarsus Valorum. From Hetton, the ARLF's leader, Zannah also recovered information regarding the creation of holocrons, a secret highly sought by her Master, who later killed Hetton after Zannah tricked him into an attack on the Dark Lord. When the parasites that comprised Bane's body armor began to cause him concern, Zannah was tasked with infiltrating the Jedi Temple archives on Coruscant to obtain information about the creatures. Her mission complete, Zannah was surprised to encounter her cousin Darovit, who confessed that he had exposed her presence to the Jedi. Zannah fled Coruscant with him and met Darth Bane on Tython, where the Sith prepared to battle the pursuant Jedi. Despite their numbers, all of the Jedi were slain, although Bane was grievously wounded and on the brink of dying. Zannah returned with her Master to Ambria and demanded on threat of death that the local healer save the Dark Lord, which he agreed to do only after Zannah revealed the Sith presence on Ambria to the Jedi. She betrayed and killed the healer upon completion of the procedure and also used her power to drive Darovit mad. The respondent Jedi assumed that he was the Sith Lord they sought and killed him, effectively convincing the Jedi of the Sith's final eradication. With no surviving witnesses, the existence of Darth Zannah and her Master remained safely anonymous."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith relocated to Ciutric IV, and over the course of ten years, Zannah grew to be an accomplished Sith sorceress who equaled Darth Bane in strength. When she failed to confront him for the position of Dark Lord, Bane believed she lacked initiative. However, Zannah had already begun to contemplate his demise. On a mission to Doan, she learned of a Dark Jedi named Set Harth and enlisted the reluctant young man as her apprentice. Zannah returned with him to Ciutric IV to confront her own Master, only to find that Bane had been captured by the Doan Royal Guard. She then returned to Doan, where she infiltrated the place of Bane's imprisonment. She located Bane and fought him, but their duel ended in a draw when both were forced to flee the prison. Soon after, Bane, who had taken the Iktotchi Darth Cognus as his new apprentice, called Zannah to meet him on Ambria, where they dueled for the final time. Zannah was initially overwhelmed by her Master's attacks, but she was able to use her sorcery to injure him. As a last resort, Bane attempted to transfer his essence into her body, but was defeated when Zannah's spirit condemned his to the void of the dark side.

Born in 1010 BBY, her youth was spent with her cousins, Darovit, Hardin, and Root, and per the custom of the people of that world, was known by her nickname Rain. Unlike Darovit and Hardin, Rain had not shown any sign of Force potential, so, when Jedi scout Torr Snapit of the Army of Light arrived looking to recruit Force-sensitives to fight in the war against the Sith, he was initially hesitant to take her. Rain did not want to be left behind while her cousins went away with the Jedi, and with assistance from Darovit, she manipulated the Force sufficiently for Snapit to allow her to come along. Rain joined her cousins as they went off-world to partake in the war's final campaign on the planet Ruusan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon their arrival, the Jedi starship was attacked by a squad of Buzzard fighters dispatched by the Sith Brotherhood of Darkness. A hole was blown in the side of the vessel, and Rain fell out to the forests below. The Jedi ship was unable to maneuver in the midst of the attack to attempt a rescue, and so Rain was left behind, with her cousins believing that she had perished. The girl had in fact been saved, her fall cushioned by the back of a green-furred Bouncer called Laa. Rain instantly befriended the creature and spent the next few days recovering from her traumatic experiences with her new companion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Oblivious to the blood being shed in battles all across Ruusan, Rain and Laa ventured across the countryside together. During the sixth such conflict for control of the planet, the Dark Lords of the Sith Brotherhood combined their power to create a storm of destruction that obliterated the landscape for miles. Rain and Laa were caught in the fallout, but the young girl instinctively enveloped herself and Laa in a bubble of protective Force energy. It was then that Rain realized she was indeed strong in the Force, and hoped to one day become a Knight of the Galactic Republic. To Rain's dismay, however, Laa prophesied that she would instead grow to be a powerful Dark Jedi. Bewildered by Laa's prediction, Rain flung herself off of a cliff in a suicide attempt, but quickly levitated herself to safety after deciding instead that her destiny was not controlled by what the Bouncer saw."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Touch of the dark side"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Widespread destruction on Ruusan caused many of the Bouncers to degenerate into a state of madness and transmit images of pain and death through the Force into the minds of the Army of Light's warriors.

Although Laa had not succumbed to the same madness as her kin, Petja and his fellow Jedi killed her anyway. Rain, who had been riding the Bouncer, was abruptly thrown off her back. Grief-stricken upon realization of what had transpired, Rain unwittingly used the dark side of the Force to break the necks of both men in retaliation for the murder of her friend. She then returned to the body of Laa, crying uncontrollably."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rain's raw display of anger attracted the attention of Darth Bane, a Dark Lord who had recently abandoned the Brotherhood of Darkness and had been wandering Ruusan's wilderness since. Rain's use of the Force in an act of vengeance, as well as the fearlessness she displayed in his presence, impressed him. When asked who she was, Rain initially gave her childhood nickname, but quickly abandoned it for her birth name of Zannah, since those who had known her as Rain were all dead as far as she was aware. The large man introduced himself as Darth Bane, the Dark Lord who would restore the lost glory of the Sith. Zannah immediately recognized him for what he was, and Bane recognized in her the potential to become his apprentice. When he told the girl that he had murdered many people\u2014women and children included\u2014Zannah confessed that she, like Bane, was a killer as well. She also admitted upon further inquiry that she had received no formal training in the ways of the Force, nor did she possess an understanding of the dark side; however, she told Bane that she was still young, and that she was willing to learn to harness its power from him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The final battle on Ruusan saw the decimation of both Jedi and Sith armies with the unleashing of Lord Skere Kaan's life-consuming thought bomb, and Zannah and her new Master were among the few survivors. She accompanied him to the caves where Kaan and his brotherhood had made their final stand, and listened as Bane explained the thought bomb's significance. Zannah's cousin Darovit appeared suddenly from another of the caves, and mistakenly believed that she was Bane's captive when he saw them together. Darovit ignited a red-bladed lightsaber and prepared to attack, causing Zannah to explode his weapon-hand with the Force. When Bane questioned Zannah's reason for sparing the boy's life, she stated that killing him was pointless.

Before she was officially accepted by him, however, she was given a final test: to find her own way off-world, and in ten standard days meet Bane on the planet Onderon. Initially resentful with Bane for the trial set before her, Zannah wandered in search of a means of completing her task, and chanced upon a shuttle with four Humans nearby. Calling herself Rain again for the time being, Zannah was mistaken for a war orphan and was brought on board their vessel, the Star-Wake, where she was fed and introduced to her hosts. The adult female named Irtanna, whom Zannah believed to be a soldier of some sort, consulted a Human male called Bordon. They offered to let Rain join them, but she refused, stating that she needed to go to Onderon. After she insisted on her destination, Zannah's hosts decided to take her back to the Republic fleet, where the young girl's destiny would be decided for her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zannah was immediately conflicted by the choices that now lay before her. On one hand, she wanted to honor her commitment to Darth Bane and meet him on Onderon, where he would then begin to help her reach her full potential. On the other, she was slightly intrigued by Bordon's offer, as she had become thoroughly exhausted with the struggle that had been her life thus far, and considered the tranquility that had been extended in her direction. She also realized that if she was turned over to the Republic, they would eventually discover her Force-sensitivity, and also the existence of her Master. Before she could resolve her dilemma, however, Rain was approached by Bordon's youngest son, Wend. After a brief conversation with the boy, Zannah made up in her mind to reject Bordon's offer, realizing that the peace he offered her amounted to nothing more than a lie; though they were happy, Bordon had no way of protecting himself or his family from real danger. When Wend was summoned to the ship's cockpit, Zannah seized the opportunity to search for a means of forcing her saviors into doing her bidding. She located a blaster pistol just as Bordon's adult son, Tallo, arrived, and was tackled by the young man in an attempt to wrench the weapon from her grasp. Bordon arrived to find Zannah and his son in quarrel, and was mortified as he watched her put a gaping hole in Tallo's chest with the blaster. Zannah gunned down Bordon next, and rushed to the cockpit to prevent Irtanna and Wend from interfering. After ordering the woman to set the autopilot on a course for Onderon, which Irtanna refused to do, Zannah killed the soldier and professed her Sith allegiance before doing the same to Wend, despite him begging for his life. She then rode the Star-Wake for seven days to Onderon, to rendezvous with Darth Bane."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zannah's arrival preceded Bane's, and she was forced to make a rough landing deep in the jungles of Onderon. Her presence attracted the attention of the Skelda clan of native Beast Riders, warriors who flew great winged beasts in battle. Zannah was quickly surrounded as she exited the Star-Wake, and she attempted to bluff her way out of the inevitable confrontation. She tried to flee when they threatened to take her ship, but was quickly tackled by the leader. To his surprise, Zannah reflexively used the Force to blast the man off of her. He realized that the little girl was an untrained Force-sensitive, and offered her one last chance to surrender in the face of insurmountable odds. Zannah, however, revealed that she was far from alone\u2014Darth Bane then appeared in the sky above them, mounted on a winged beast larger than any of those commanded by clan Skelda. She then watched in awe as her Master single-handedly defeated the entire clan, sustained near-fatal injuries, and recovered from them instantaneously, thanks to the orbalisk crustaceans that she saw now covered his body. The Dark Lord was indeed impressed that Zannah had survived the preliminary tests he had set before her; she was then officially made his apprentice, and her real training began."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Bane's apprentice"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zannah's training took place on the world of Ambria for much of her early time with Bane. Because he sought to keep his new Order beneath galactic notice, Bane instilled within Zannah tenets of secrecy, patience, and ingenuity. Her first lesson was to tame a wild neek\u2014a reptilian creature native to Ambria, specifically near the dark side-infused Lake Natth\u2014and to bring the domesticated creature back to their camp of its own volition. While familiarizing herself with the animals, Zannah spent days earning one particular neek's trust and, in doing so, became emotionally attached to it, treating it almost like a pet. Finally, she was able to coax the reptile into following her. When they arrived at the camp her Master was pleased, but he then suddenly snapped its neck through the Force, and ordered Zannah to toss the dead thing into a boiling pot nearby. She realized at that moment that her Master's lesson was twofold: having the patience to dominate another being or creature through cunning, and to bend it to her will, all while maintaining a sense of detachment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time Zannah was fourteen, her training had advanced into the study of the ways of the ancient Sith. She learned to manipulate the power of the dark side through Sith spells that Bane had extracted from the holocron of Freedon Nadd, which he had found in Nadd's tomb during his trek to the jungle moon Dxun. Bane confessed his own inability with the inner-workings of Sith magic, and stated that his talents were expressed in more natural and elemental uses of the dark side. Zannah, however, was eager to learn Nadd's teachings and immediately began to absorb everything she could. While she studied the transcript, Bane warned her that if she ever attempted her spells on him, he would destroy her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zannah constructed her personal double-bladed lightsaber not long afterward. Her customized weapon included a longer than average hilt and was powered by a set of synthetic lightsaber crystals, one of which was known as Bane's Heart. Her lightsaber produced blades that were three-quarters of a meter in length each, ones that also released an electrical discharge when the weapon was utilized by anyone other than its owner, courtesy of Bane's Heart. Zannah built her lightsaber in that manner to compensate for the proportions of her petite frame. Bane explained that her weapon was critical to her chosen style of lightsaber combat, one that expended minimal energy while maximizing her endurance in battle, creating what he described as the \"impenetrable defense\" of Soresu."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Her Master's will"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 990 BBY, Zannah had become more than just a Sith apprentice; she was now an instrument of Darth Bane's will. Because the Dark Lord's orbalisk armor prevented him from moving in public unnoticed, he was forced to rely on Zannah as his primary means of contact with the outside world. To further their covert Sith agenda, the adolescent woman was sent on a variety of secret missions that were designed to force the enemies of the Sith into open conflict with the Galactic Republic, on whose superior strength Darth Bane counted to eliminate those threats he deemed less-significant. Among them were also schemes that slowly spread the numbers of the Jedi thin, so that over time, their ability to efficiently respond to a sudden crisis en masse was diminished."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of her missions involved the exploitation of a group of dissidents on the planet Serenno known as the Anti-Republic Liberation Front. Under the guise of \"Rainah,\" Zannah became the lover of one of the ARLF's more prominent members, a Twi'lek male named Kelad'den. She convinced the Lethan to make an abduction of Supreme Chancellor Tarsus Valorum, who was scheduled to visit Serenno soon on a diplomatic mission.

Once there, she used her sorcery to drive Cyndra insane, which caused the Chiss woman to gouge out her own eyes and babble incoherently. In retaliation, Paak attacked with a vibroblade, and Zannah summoned her lightsaber in her own defense. After using the Force to snap her restraints, she toyed with Paak, who then pulled a blaster on her. She deflected the first bolt and redirected the second into his head, which killed him instantly. Hetton, who had been watching nearby, was impressed by Zannah and recognized her as a Sith Lord; he then confessed that he had been waiting his entire life for someone like her. Zannah learned from Hetton that he had used his vast resources to collect a wealth of dark side artifacts and knowledge over the past three decades. Her interest piqued when Hetton spoke of an ancient Dark Lord of the Sith named Belia Darzu, who was said to have mastered the creation of Sith holocrons, a skill that had eluded Zannah's Master thus far. During their conversation, Zannah also learned that Hetton employed eight Umbaran Shadow Assassins who would consign themselves to the Sith Lord's disposal should she choose to take Hetton as her apprentice. Zannah agreed, though not in earnest; she planned to simply use Hetton and eventually take from him information that would lead her Master to Belia Darzu's fortress on the planet Tython, where she hoped he would discover the secret of holocron creation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zannah was given a datacard that contained the sum of Hetton's knowledge.

She expected Bane to demand an explanation of her actions, but he instead attacked her under the belief that she had betrayed him. Zannah suffered a severe beating before she was finally able to reveal that she had only allied herself with Bane's attacker for the benefit of obtaining the secret of creating holocrons. He ceased his attack at that moment and allowed Zannah to present the datacard that contained the hyperspace route to Tython.

The Dark Lord had obtained for Zannah an alias in the form of a Padawan named Nalia Adollu, to whom Zannah was physically very similar. For a week she studied Adollu's profile, as well as that of her Pyn'gani Jedi Master, Anno Wen-Chii, until every detail of both individuals had been committed to memory. A cover story was also fabricated that claimed that Wen-Chii needed Adollu to research material regarding a rare parasitic life form native to his homeworld of Polus; in truth, Zannah would actually be searching the expanse of the Jedi Archives for any information regarding orbalisks, the creatures whose carapaces formed Darth Bane's impenetrable armor. To complete her deception, Zannah had also practiced a Sith spell that involved covering her dark side aura with one of light. She worked diligently on perfecting the spell, but despite her best efforts, her true disposition still occasionally manifested.

She proceeded to the fourth hall of the Archives\u2014the section dedicated to zoological study\u2014to begin her search for any information on orbalisks. Days of tedious research failed to reveal anything conclusive, until one night Zannah discovered a thesis entitled An Examination and Exploration of a Most Dangerous and Resilient Organism.

She led Darovit to a different section of the Archives, where she accessed another computer and found an adequate hyperspace route to the Deep Core world, and copied that information onto her datacard as well. She and Darovit then left the Temple, boarded the Loranda, and fled Coruscant. While en route to Tython, Zannah's cousin tried repeatedly to sway her from the path of the dark side, though to no avail. She eventually responded by Force-choking Darovit, and advised him that her Master's need of his healing skills was the only thing that prevented her from killing him.

After he demanded to know why she had come, Zannah explained the details of her chance encounter with Darovit in the Jedi Temple and how he had revealed their existence to the High Council. She also told Bane that Darovit would be able to rid him of the orbalisk infestation. Their meeting was interrupted when they noticed another ship heading fast in their direction. Both Zannah and her Master felt the light-side orientation of its passengers and realized that the Jedi had followed them to Tython.

She told Darovit to hide there as well, and explained to her Master that the young man would only hinder their efforts. Five Jedi burst into the room soon afterward, and battle quickly ensued. Zannah immediately erected her impenetrable defensive wall while taking up position in a nearby corner in an effort to protect her flanks from her two Human assailants, Knights Johun Othone and the physically enormous Sarro Xaj. Zannah quickly realized that Xaj\u2014who wielded a massive blue-bladed version of her own weapon\u2014posed the greater threat of her two opponents. His powerful attacks were metered, however, by the awkward dueling style of Othone, which allowed Zannah to play off of the smaller man's disruption of the larger one's advance.

Without the benefit of the smaller man to impede the larger one's efforts, Zannah was steadily driven back by the strength of Xaj's blows. The flow of battle shifted, however, when the Ithorian's concentration was suddenly disrupted, robbing Zannah's opponent of his Force-empowerment. Zannah seized the opportunity to cast a spell that summoned the Jedi's most primal fears, causing him to flail about in terror. She closed in and swiftly cut him down, then masked her Force presence before moving in behind Bane's female Echani assailant and running her through. When Bane's two surviving opponents realized that Zannah had killed their companion, they turned to face her, and Bane responded by severing the Human's weapon-hand and beheading the Equine Jedi, Valenthyne Farfalla. Her Master then mortally wounded the Ithorian, but in a last desperate move, the Jedi trapped both himself and Bane within a bubble of Force energy just as the Dark Lord unleashed a storm of purple lightning intended for Othone. Bane suffered the full force of his own attack, which left him a smoking husk on the ground.

She repeatedly ordered Darovit to intervene, and each time he professed his inability to heal the Dark Lord. The realization that she would be unable to advance the Sith agenda if Bane died slowly dawned on Zannah; with his condition rapidly deteriorating, she decided to visit the only other healer whom she knew: Caleb of Ambria.

She questioned further if he knew her reason for coming to him, and Caleb answered that he had hid himself when he sensed Zannah approaching. She asked out of curiosity when he had constructed the cellar and learned that Caleb had created the hiding place for his daughter\u2014Bane had found Caleb during the New Sith Wars and had forced the healer to help him by threatening his daughter's life. Caleb's daughter was now an adult, however, and Zannah took notice of the satisfaction with which he spoke as he told her that his daughter was gone, and the Sith therefore held no more power over him. Time and again Zannah attempted to coerce Caleb into cooperation, but threats, bribes, and even torture were not enough to compel the healer into again serving the Sith.

She rebuffed Darovit's subsequent attempts to placate her but became partially interested when he said that even though Caleb had refused to assist her, Bane could still be saved. She listened as Darovit explained that he had convinced Caleb to heal Bane\u2014only if Zannah agreed to send a message to the Jedi alerting them of the presence of the Sith on Ambria. She at first denounced Darovit's plan as preposterous, but after several moments of silent contemplation, Zannah agreed to the terms of the deal. Caleb subsequently upheld his end of the bargain. Zannah initially suggested relocating Bane to the Loranda's medical bay, but the healer refused, believing that Ambria's powerful undercurrent of Force energy lent strength to his medicaments. Upon the task's completion, Zannah demanded to see her Master, who was barely awake, but alert nonetheless. She told Bane that he was now bereft of the orbalisks to which he had grown accustomed, just as he slipped back into unconsciousness. When she visited him again two days later, Zannah's mentor was fully coherent. She explained that Caleb had healed him, though only after Zannah alerted the Jedi to their presence on Ambria. Bane was infuriated by Zannah's apparent betrayal and demanded that she kill him in lieu of surrendering him to the Jedi. He begged her to flee and seek an apprentice of her own, that she might continue the Order of the Sith Lords. When Zannah revealed that such action was currently impossible, since Caleb had also stipulated that the Loranda be rendered inoperable, Bane regarded her with disgust, utterly disappointed by her failure to meet his expectations.

When she elaborated, however, on how the Jedi had departed after killing Darovit under the pretense that he had been the Sith Lord whom they sought, and that the Sith had effectively been consigned to obscurity as a result, her Master released his grasp. Pleased by Zannah's ingenuity, Bane confessed that he had underestimated his apprentice and would never have asked for death had he known the extent of her plans. Zannah expressed her appreciation of the compliment, but vowed that she would one day surpass him in power and destroy him when he had nothing left to offer\u2014a proclamation that garnered her Master's approval."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Path to Mastery"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "A new apprentice"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the events on Ambria, Zannah, under the alias of Allia Omek, and Bane spent the next ten years strengthening themselves, cultivating resources and contacts, and perpetuating the Jedi's belief that the Sith had been eradicated. By 980 BBY, she and her Master had relocated to the planet Ciutric IV, where they began living in a mansion outside of the city of Daplona as the wealthy merchant siblings Allia and Sepp Omek, respectively. Zannah continued her training as well, both under Darth Bane and through her own acquisitions of long-forgotten Sith knowledge. As the years passed, however, she still had yet to confront Bane and wrest from him the position of Sith Master. He speculated that she was waiting for him to age until his powers were weakened and he would be easier to defeat, which, in his mind, made her unworthy of becoming the Dark Lord of the Sith. Unbeknownst to Bane, however, Zannah had not attacked him for two reasons\u2014first, she had noticed Bane's deteriorating body, but was wary that it was a trick to prompt her into a premature attack, believing that he was testing her patience. Secondly, she wanted to acquire an apprentice of her own before attacking him, so that if she won, she would be ready to continue the legacy of the Rule of Two without further delay. Without Zannah's knowledge, Bane then began to look into the legend of Darth Andeddu's holocron, which was said to hold the secret of eternal life\u2014an ability that would allow him to live long enough to find and train another apprentice, one whom he felt would be more worthy than Zannah."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, the Jedi Knight Medd Tandar, who had been sent to mediate a political situation on the planet Doan, was killed. Zannah was sent by Bane on a mission to find out who was responsible for the murder of the Jedi, while he secretly went on his own mission to recover Darth Andeddu's holocron. On Doan, Zannah encountered evidence of a Dark Jedi who was searching for Sith artifacts. With the help of a Rodian named Quano and his Human friend, Pommat, she discovered that the Dark Jedi had come from Nal Hutta. From this, using various other contacts, she eventually tracked the Dark Jedi\u2014who was named Set Harth\u2014to his home on Nal Hutta, where she confronted him in a duel. Zannah defeated Harth with ease, using her Sith sorcery to incapacitate him. She decided that if he was strong enough to recover from her sorcery, then she would take him as her apprentice.

Tenn proved to be stubborn, however, refusing to violate his customers' confidentiality. Zannah was thus forced to interrogate him with the dark side, revealing her true identity as a Sith. From this, she was able to extract only one name from Tenn\u2014Darth Andeddu\u2014before she had to kill him, lest he betray the secret of the Sith Order's survival."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Doan"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon returning to her Master's mansion, Zannah mentioned the name of Andeddu to Harth, who revealed that during his time training under Jedi Master Obba, a member of the Council of First Knowledge, Harth had spent a large amount of time researching the histories of the ancient Sith. Harth had come across the name Andeddu multiple times and had thus heard that the Sith Lord had ruled over the planet Prakith as a god. He also revealed that, according to legend, Andeddu had created his own holocron, in which it was rumored he had documented the secret of eternal life.

Upon arrival, Zannah left Harth with explicit instructions to stay and guard the Victory in one of the prison's hangars before she left to hunt down Bane. It was not long before she sensed that he had escaped from where he had been held captive, and she found him shortly afterward in a hallway conversing with a woman. Catching him unawares, Zannah attacked Bane with a powerful Force blast that he was able to shield himself from, but nonetheless killed the woman with whom he had been speaking. As he recovered, Zannah criticized her Master for betraying her as well as his own Rule of Two by searching for eternal life. Bane, in turn, rebuked her for waiting until he had grown weak before attacking him, claiming that, in doing so, she had violated the tenet that only the strongest could survive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zannah then attacked her weaponless Master, who defended himself with Force lightning. She quickly advanced, forcing him to retreat through the prison's corridors and cornering him several times, but never managing to kill him.

Zannah's duel with her Master ended shortly afterward when Bane shot two bursts of lightning into the wall, setting off one of the detonators prematurely and causing the passageway to collapse between them. Zannah was unable to reach him and decided instead to save herself before the entire building came crashing down. As the warning alarm went off, Zannah backtracked through the corridors until she arrived at the hangar, where she was surprised to find that Set Harth had disobeyed her orders and absconded. Zannah made haste her own departure from the collapsing prison in the Victory, while recognizing the error in choosing Harth as her apprentice, realizing that she had overlooked many of his flaws in her eagerness to take on the mantle of Dark Lord. She also speculated that Bane might have been telling the truth\u2014he had not gone after Andeddu's holocron in the hopes of living forever; rather, only to live long enough to choose and train another apprentice, before his body weakened too much.

Zannah arrived on Ambria and landed the Victory just outside Caleb's camp, where she found that Bane was accompanied by a female Iktotchi assassin whom he revealed had sworn her loyalty to the Sith as his new apprentice.

Zannah decided that to ensure victory she needed to use her sorcery; however, as she split her focus between Bane and gathering her power, she failed to notice the freshly-dug grave of Serra, who had been recently killed by Cognus. Zannah tripped over the grave and fell, and Bane instantly set upon her with a barrage of powerful blows and kicks, cracking one of her ribs. Zannah was able to free herself from the assault with a series of acrobatic maneuvers and quickly stabbed at Bane, only to find that he had not followed her escape, instead staying several meters away. Her mistake had cost her; she now had a broken rib, and her acrobatics had tired her greatly.

Desperate, Zannah tapped into the energy of the dark side nexus present on Ambria. Using this power, she drew forth tendrils of pure dark side energy from the ground, and directed them against her master. One of her tendrils clipped Bane's shoulder and caused him such excruciating pain that he fell to the ground in shock. Zannah continued to pour the dark side into her manifestations, and Bane tried ineffectively to stall them with Force lightning before he charged the sorceress in an attempt to overwhelm her with brute strength. Each of Zannah's tendrils were dodged as Bane moved in, swept her off of her feet, and knocked her lightsaber out of her hand. As he went for the killing blow, however, one of her tendrils cut off his arm, and he collapsed to the ground in agony. Bane quickly grabbed Zannah's wrist in a moment of despair and performed the ritual of essence transfer\u2014a magical ability in which one's consciousness was transferred into another object or being\u2014which he had learned from Andeddu's holocron.

When Cognus called the name of Bane, Zannah declared that Bane was no more, and that she, Darth Zannah, was the new Dark Lord of the Sith. As Cognus's new Master, she instructed the Iktotchi to take Bane's lightsaber, which she would use until she built one of her own.

Because of the anonymity required by the Sith, however, Zannah took measures to make herself inconspicuous when necessary.

She showed no fear of Darth Bane upon their first meeting, instead admitting that she, like him, was also a killer.
