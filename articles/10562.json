The system contained at least eleven orbital positions, with the ninth and tenth positions being filled by the planets Aur IX and Aur X, which were in fact diamonds the size of terrestrial worlds. These huge gems were believed to have once sat at the cores of gas giants. The eleventh orbital position was occupied by a cloud of diamond fragments. These unusual features, termed the Aur Diamonds, led to speculation that the system had been a creation of the ancient Celestial species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Aur system was originally meant to be mentioned in the 2012 source book The Essential Guide to Warfare by Jason Fry and Paul R.
