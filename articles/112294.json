The main reactor was not a weak point in the Death Star I. It was only a section that was not well protected by the Imperial Navy because they assumed no threat could come close to doing damage. The weakness on the Death Star(s) were that small craft were able to avoid the heavy turbolasers. Thus, they could fly down the polar trench and destroy the huge battle station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
