With an extra launcher, a stronger and larger hull, and high-tech targeting systems, it had much more use as an anti-air frigate. However, its build restricted it to being only for air attacks, making it useless against land forces and other ships. Regardless, it excelled in killing any air units; it would tear through fighters and bombers and even give it to the fearsome Air cruiser."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
