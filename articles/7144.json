The new underwater city brought all Gungans together in a unified community, under the rule of the Gungan High Council. In the total Gunga population, the Ankurans made up a relatively small percentage; however, they long maintained a strong presence on the Council. Several Ankura Gungans thrived in Bartyn's Landing, the capital city of Lamaredd. Bamfurd managed and owned Bamfurd's Tapcafe; and a street wrestler named The Mighty Musstoro operated in the Center Sphere District."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
