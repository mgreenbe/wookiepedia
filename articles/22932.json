Originally a pleasure model, the vessel's owner, playboy multi-millionaire Seth Cambriel spent several years turning the Cambus Gale into a racing yacht by reshaping its hull, rerigging the sails, and upgrading the craft as much as possible. The yacht measured 23 meters, and required a crew of six to operate efficiently, although it could be manned by three if necessary. There was room for two passengers and 1 metric ton of cargo, and the yacht could reach speeds of 70 kilometers and hour. While Cambriel's modifications had made it into a decent racing yacht, it could not compete with the dedicated racing yachts off-world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Seth Cambriel's years on Spira, he would often take the Cambus Gale sailing around Ataria Island.
