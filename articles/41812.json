During the time of the Clone Wars, Dusty was among a group of couriers that were sent by Vex to collect an illicit cargo, in the jungles of the planet Cularin. Dusty flew to the rendezvous point where they would be collecting the cargo, on a swoop. When they arrived, there was no-one else there and Dusty kept checking his comlink, to see if anyone was trying to contact them. However, they were amushed by a group of enforcers that were working for the Hutt crime lord Riboga. Dusty was shot in the face, killing him instantly."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
