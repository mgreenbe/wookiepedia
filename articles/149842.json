When an Emergence of the Great Hyperspace Disaster occurred in the system, Praknat 3, Trymant's closest moon, was struck by a piece of the Legacy Run's main hull, changing the gravitational balance of the entire system. Trymant IV was tilted closer to the second sun then it had ever been, resulting in an ecological catastrophe as all of its aboveground water sources were vapourized, turning it into a desert."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
