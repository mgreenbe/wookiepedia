It had approximately 3000 residents. It was home to numerous establishments such as the Lost Loves Casino, the Starlight Theater, and Njinska's Tavern. It was once a popular resort/amusement park area, but fell on hard times and ended up as run-down and seedy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The waters near Phyrstal island were known to be home to pirates which would raid stray ships or yachts. Visitors could use a Hydrobike to get to the island, and there was also a ferry that left every morning from Le Yer which was considered safer.
