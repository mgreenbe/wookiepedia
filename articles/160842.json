Serving Ren, the Knights would pillage, destroy and kill across the galaxy, until they fell under new leadership, that of the fallen Jedi Ben Solo, who became the apprentice of Supreme Leader Snoke, Kylo Ren. This brought the Knights into working with the First Order, and following Kylo's accession to Supreme Leader after killing Snoke, he and his Knights sought to hunt down the Jedi Rey, a mission which led Vicrul and the others to Pasaana and later Kijimi. However, Vicrul, alongside all his fellow knights, would meet their end at the hands of a redeemed Ben Solo, who fought and killed them during the climactic Battle of Exegol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Encounter with Luke Skywalker"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point before the rise of the First Order and their war against the Resistance, Vicrul joined the Knights of Ren, an organization of Force-sensitive warriors who followed the dark side and an ideology based on the Ren, the lightsaber wielded by Ren, the leader of the Knights. Traveling throughout the galaxy, the Knights of Ren searched for other Force users to join their ranks. At some point, the Knights acquired the starship Night Buzzard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, Vicrul, together with his fellow knights, Ap'lek, Cardo, Kuruk, Trudgen, Ushar and Ren traveled to Elphrona to steal artifacts in the Jedi outpost there. At the same time, Luke Skywalker, a young Ben Solo and Lor San Tekka were there too. When the young Ben discovers a Lightsaber rifle, Ren tells Skywalker  that everything inside the outpost belongs to him and his allies as Vicrul and the other knights confront the trio. Skywalker retorts that it all belongs to him, as it is a Jedi outpost and he is the last Jedi. Telling the Knights that they are going to get what they came for, Ren ignites his lightsaber. Skywalker tells Tekka to stay out of the fight and orders Solo to look after him. Tekka protests that Skywalker will not be able to fight the seven Knights on his own. Igniting his lightsaber, Skywalker replies that he will be just fine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ren ordered the Knights to attack Skywalker. Dodging their attacks, Skywalker used the Force to repel the Knights, throwing them against the walls of the outpost, including Vicrul. On the side, Tekka marveled at Skywalker's ability. Skywalker asked the Knights if they have had enough, but Ren replied that they still had numbers on their side. Skywalker lifted their weapons into the air and crushed them, leaving only Ren with a weapon. Ren flipped a switch on his lightsaber, telling Skywalker that if the weapon left his hand it would explode, killing them all. He also added that he can sense the dark side in Solo. Skywalker told Ren to leave. Ren agreed, but unmasked himself first. He asked Solo whether he is sure he wants to be a Jedi, and told him to contact the Knights if he ever wanted to explore his dark side more."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle with Sector Security"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After hearing from their master about the Force-sensitive criminal Karrst, who, along with his brother Filin, caused over one hundred deaths, Vicrul and the other Knights of Ren sought to locate him.

While resting at the bar, Vicrul approached Ren to inform him of a new arrival at the door of the cantina, telling him to check it out. To Ren's pleasant surprise, a bruised, battered but alive Ben Solo stood in the doorway. Vicrul stood by and watched as Ren and Solo spoke, Ren musing how Ben took his time in getting to them, and caught them just before they planned to leave. Ben said he was held up, and Ren told him he looked as I felt he did been chewed up, and spit out, a statement that frustrated Ben, to which  Ren told him that it was just a joke. Ren removed his mask, saying that it made talking to him more intense than it ought to be, but mused that Snoke believed the Knights and Ben could be friends."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ben declared that he wanted to travel with the Knights, citing that he would be useful, and that he was strong in the force. Ren then told him the price was to cause a good death. When Ben mentioned he had already taken a life, Vicrul and the Knights gathered round Ren, who said that he and the Knights would love to hear the story, and to tell them who he had killed. Ben told them of Voe, Tai and Hennix, three Jedi he trained alongside under Luke Skywalker, all three of whom survived the destruction of Luke's temple, and pursued Ben for answers. After telling the Knights the events that caused the death of Hennix, Ren asked Vicrul and the other Knights what they thought. Agreeing with them Ren, told Solo that while it was indeed a death, it was not a good death, at least not good enough to appease the Knights of Ren. Ben tried to argue the point, only for Ren to point out that he didn't really want Hennix dead. Ren then stood up, Vicrul and the others moving to his side, with Ren agreeing to bring Ben with them, to see if they liked him, and he liked them, and that maybe he would find his good death."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle on the Minemoon"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vicrul traveled with the Knights, Ren, and Solo, who had been equipped with a new outfit at Ren's order, to the Minemoon of Mimban in the Mid Rim, where he and the other Knights captured several miners. After Ben used the force to look into one of the miners minds to find the location of the arifcat the Knights hoped to steal, Ren ordered Vicrul and the others to kill all the captive miners, which they did without hesitation or remorse, with Vicrul brutally stabbing one with his scythe. The Knights then journeyed deeper into the underground of the moon, seeking the Mindsplinter. Ren then ordered Vicrul and the others to jump down and kill all the miners, so they could then steal the Mindsplinter without resistance. However, the seemingly easy mission was interrupted by the arrival of Voe and Tai."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Vicrul and the other Knights killed the miners, Voe attacked them. Vicrul lunged at her, swinging his scythe in an attempt to cut her down at Ren's furious command, but before he could strike, Vicrul was kicked in the face by Voe, and sent sprawling. As these events played out, Ben had started to fight Ren, who had killed Tai and was now intent on killing Solo too. However, the battle did not go in Ren's favor, as Vicrul and the other Knights watched as Solo stabbed and killed Ren, earning his good death in the process."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A new master"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Ren dead, and Ben having proved himself, having killed both Ren and Voe, he had earned Vicrul and the other Knights respect. Vicrul and the others kneeled before him, a silent declaration of loyalty to their new master. Vicrul, the Knights and their new master then delegated the cavern as it exploded, and left the Minemoon. Aboard the Night Buzzard, Vicrul and the other Knights watched as Ben tinkered with the multitude of lightsabers he had claimed from his victims, before eventually bleeding his once blue kyber crystal red, and forging crossguard lightsaber. Ben earned the title of Master of the Knights of Ren, and later took the name Kylo Ren, abandoning his old life entirely.

After the helmet's reforging, Vicrul and the other Knights accompanied Ren to the Steadfast via their ship, the Night Buzzard. As they walked with Ren passing the hallways, they got the attention of two stormtroopers, who found their arrival to be cool.

Although he was untrained in the Force, Vicrul was still capable of manifesting some Force powers, but these powers came unbidden and uncontrolled. Vicrul passively projected fear on his opponents, and possessed enhanced reflexes. Vicrul, alongside the other Knights of Ren, had fighting skills and martial prowess few could rival. Vicrul saw himself as a harvester, using his ultrasonic scythe to cut down enemies and take their souls to augment his power. Despite Vicrul's apparent skill, he was still effortlessly cut down by Ben Solo during the Battle of Exegol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vicrul's weapon of choice was an annealed phrik scythe.

The character was simultaneously identified in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Galactic Guide, and his card in Star Wars: Card Trader, all of which were released in tandem with the movie.\nThe design for Vicrul was created by artist Glyn Dillon for The Force Awakens. Like the other Knights, Vicrul's design was based off of unused concept art for the \"Jedi Killer\", a character that eventually evolved into Kylo Ren.
