Not long after, a conference was held on Chandrila between Grand Vizier Mas Amedda, during which the latter formally surrendered to the New Republic. The following Galactic Concordance sealed the Republic's victory over the Galactic Empire and began the process of the restoration of democracy to the galaxy. Although peace was formally declared, fighting between the new government and certain Imperial factions would continue for quite some time, until the hostilities would finally die out, with some warlords either suing for peace or escaping into deep space. Those Imperial officers who did not yield were then declared enemies of the state."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some elements of the Empire's leadership and military rejected the stipulations, and, while the violence did not resume, the New Republic and an organized remnant of the Galactic Empire became locked into a cold war. While this standoff was of certain significance, the rest of the Empire, while disjointed, did not cease to exist by any means. As per the conditions of the Galactic Concordance, the Imperial capital of Coruscant was ceded over to the New Republic, where a provisional government was established. Agreeing to the terms of the Concordance, all non-military officials and those officers who respected all conditions were granted pardons. Many Imperials within the higher echelons of the armed forces refused to immediately agree to the terms, and, in turn, they were branded as war criminals. Despite this, the empire was allowed to survive in the form of successor states that maintained full sovereignty over territories that did not fall under the New Republic's jurisdiction. With Coruscant no longer the seat of executive power for the Empire, Imperial leadership was forced reconstitute itself. As such the central Imperial government was officially dissolved, with some of its leaders going as far to leave the Empire altogether and joining the New Republic. Additionally, those territories that fell under the authority of these former Imperials were assimilated into the New Republic. Although some chose to do this, there were still those who remained loyal to the actual Imperial establishment, unlike their comrades who joined the restored Republic, those Imperials who sought independent sovereignty, and the aggressive hardliners who refused to acquiesce to the Concordance's stipulations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As patriotism and loyalty towards what remained of the true Empire did not die with its fragmentation, there were still dedicated Imperials, both civilian and military, who remained dedicated to its existence. The organized Imperial Navy and constituents the Empire's war machine were still very much consolidated, as not all forces had joined with warlords or the hardliners who had retreated and partitioned themselves in regions outside of the New Republic's influence. As the Empire was simply too vast to disband altogether, a conditional accord was decided upon between the New Republic and the Galactic Empire in regards to what would finally become of the latter's foundational aggregation and the powers that it still held. The agreement called for a conditional restructuring of the Empire, allowing it to persist as an official and self-governed entity, but ensuring limitations on its ability to wage war. Imperial borders were redrawn and a successor state was formed by what remained of the old Imperial establishment, and, as per the terms of the Galactic Concordance, the new government that would ultimately agree to the stipulations. At the command of the New Republic, the remnant leaders ordered that all fleets that were still loyal to the Empire be recalled to the Core and Inner Rim. although Empire remained a divided force, with the remnant factions that went rogue refusing to acknowledge the order, now standing as a hawkish confederation locked into a cold war with the New Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the reluctant agreement, a militarized faction of the Empire refused to admit defeat, as rest of the Empire in the Core Worlds and Inner Rim had. While these hardliners did not actively carry out any major military campaigns against the New Republic and vice versa, both powers remained hostile towards one another. Although the Old Empire was decentralized and divided into various official and recognized states that preserved the Imperial tradition in certain non-Republic sectors, the residual faction founded by those hardliners was considerable enough to be a cause of concern to the New Republic, thereby prolonging the cold war. Since resentments left over from the Galactic Civil War never truly went away, with those on both sides despising the other, the cold war between the non-compliant Imperial remnant and the New Republic would last for decades. As it wore on, the remnant began to retreat and then colonize the Unknown Regions of the Galaxy, where it would consolidate its power and initiate a rapid military buildup. During this period, political hardliners who opposed the Republic assumed leadership of the remnant and transitioned it into the First Order, a powerful military junta based upon the policies and principles of the \"Old Empire.\""}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Republic Gridlock"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 28 ABY, infighting in the Republic's Galactic Senate between the Populists and Centrists factions had created a state of political gridlock.

These shadow corporations were owned by several Centrist senators such as Lady Carise Sindian, who worked as double agents for the Order.

In an attempt to hamper the senatorial investigation, Lady Carise secretly hired the Amaxine leader and former Imperial Arliz Hadrassian to bomb the New Republic senatorial complex. Despite the political uproar, Leia and Ransolm persisted with their investigation. On Daxam IV, Casterfo and Greer met Arliz and learned about the Amaxine warriors' illegal rearmament efforts.

Continuing their search for Lor San Tekka, Dameron and Black Squadron bribed their way into Megalox prison on the high gravity world of Megalox Beta.

At the request of General Organa's spymaster C-3PO, Dameron along with BB-8 and the technician Oddy Muva embarked on a mission to Kaddak to retrieve a member of the Resistance spy droid network who had obtained information on the First Order including the location of Supreme Leader Snoke.

His plan involved feeding the Resistance BX-series droid commando N1-ZX with false intelligence and following Poe's ship back to the Resistance base. Terex planned to use the Ranc gang to wipe out the Resistance, eliminating a major threat to the First Order. As planned, Dameron and his team recovered N1-ZX and escaped Kaddak.

The local villagers, who were members of the Church of the Force, made a valiant effort to fight off the attackers but were massacred by the First Order.
