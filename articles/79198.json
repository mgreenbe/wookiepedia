Like many LIN droids, she was reprogrammed to serve beyond her original purpose as a minelayer. She was a data recorder for legal cases, and also a mobile entertainment system in a shipboard casino. She was then used as a forward military observer during unauthorized experiments, and made capable of linking up with common artillery. Though she was to be memory wiped after this, due to the sudden ending of the experiments this was neglected. She is reticent to reveal this aspect of her programming, preferring to emphasize her work as an entertainment droid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
