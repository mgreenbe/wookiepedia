This scrubland was a tumultuous environment where lava sinkholes would erupt at random and without warning, posing a grave peril to any passerby. The birds, however, could instinctively detect the imminent emergence of any sinkhole and would react by flying in circles around the specific area. As such, they indirectly warned travelers of when to avoid a particular spot in the terrain, mitigating this danger."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
