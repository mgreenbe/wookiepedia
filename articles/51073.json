It was attended by all the members of the Triumvirate, which consisted of Jedi Master Saba Sebatyne, Senator Haydnat Treen and General Merratt Jaxton. Some members of Hamner's family came as well as his friends from the military. Because he died in a fight, the Justice Department was debating whether this was a case of murder or not. Hamner's former apprentice, Izal Waz, gave the eulogy and lit the funeral pyre of his late master."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
