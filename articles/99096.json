Until the Clone Wars, the commanders were the only OOM units to possess intelligence and independence apart from the Central Control Computer. A notable command battle droid was OOM-9, who commanded the droid forces in the Invasion of Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The OOM command battle droid were constructed by Baktoid Combat Automata and had a set of black sensors along with tan plating. The droids also had masculine programming and was 1.91 meters in height. Yellow markings on their torsos and heads marked the status as a command battle droid. They contained programming which allowed them to adapt to circumstances, which sometimes malfunctioned. They received long-distance signals allowing them to be far from base with their squads, and reported directly to the Central Control Computer. If a command droid lost contact with a CCC, it would remain active for three minutes, upon which time it would enter standby mode for a further ten minutes, after which it shut down completely."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The OOM command battle droids were deployed as part of the Trade Federation Droid Army in 32 BBY. During the Invasion of Naboo, OOM commanders, along with organic officers, took charge of regular infantry droids. OOM command battle droids were in charge of the droids sent to hunt Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn. OOM-9 reported directly to Viceroy Nute Gunray. After the Droid Control Ship was destroyed, all the droid units on Naboo shut down."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trade Federation OOM command droids joined the Separatist Droid Army. During the Clone Wars, they served as liaisons between infantry droids and their Separatist masters, making them the CIS equivalent of the clone trooper commanders. Although most had antennae, some assigned to Armored Assault Tanks lacked them. Later in the Clone Wars, the OOM series command droid was upgraded and was given a larger back pack, but was later dropped for an unknown reason.[source?] Battle droid officers led company-level formations and were assigned as captains of Separatist starships. Certain battle droids were granted additional programming and assigned as officers. Following the demise of the Separatist Council, all units of the Separatist Droid Army were deactivated, barring those used by Separatist holdouts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "OOM command battle droids first appeared with the release of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace and its tie-ins. The command model was first identified in the Star Wars Roleplaying Game, as an advanced version of the standard trooper model, sharing the designation of the Command Officer OOM-9 from The Phantom Menace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to the release of Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, security droids were claimed to have possessed intelligence and independence like the command droids, although they were still subordinate to the latter. Both command and security droids at the Invasion of Naboo were also described as possessing low-grade electronic brains, unlike the pilot and infantry droids. However, these claims conflict with other sources that state all those droids possessed only control signal receivers and simple processors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
