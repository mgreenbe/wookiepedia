Equipped with a database containing information on thousands of known species of wildlife and space for recording new data, the ILF-6500 was most often used as the center of a security perimeter for scout or hunting encampments. Mounted on a telescoping tripod that could extend up to three kilometers in height and capable of monitoring an area nearly half a kilometer across, dependant on terrain and vegetation, the ILF-6500 was capable of tracking and identifying up to two dozen targets at a time, categorize and rank them in order of threat level, and alert its operators by sending updates to their datapads or sounding a shrill alarm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
