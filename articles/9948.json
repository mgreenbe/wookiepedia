The TIE striker was streamlined for air superiority, featuring a solid stabilizing mass in its central hull, framed by tilting wings where a standard TIE/ln space superiority starfighter's large hexagonal panels were vulnerable to crosswinds, making the vessels difficult to steer outside of a vacuum. The TIE striker was fitted with twin ion engines for forward thrust, although also utilized specialized repulsorlifts for its atmospheric operations. The TIE striker was designed for atmospheric patrols over Imperial ground installations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
