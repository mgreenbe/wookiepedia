In addition, the planet played host to the Agricultural Corps, where Jedi who had failed their training were sent to work as farmers and laborers. During one of the earliest battles of the Jedi Civil War, Telos was devastated by forces of the Sith Empire. Under orders from Darth Malak, former Republic admiral Saul Karath demanded the planet's surrender; upon being rebuffed, he carried out his orders to bombard the surface. Soon after, the Jedi Order, fearful of an attack on the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine and the possible loss of many valuable relics, chose Telos as the site for a secret Jedi academy and repository.

The Telosian Restoration Project called for the construction of Citadel Station, an immense space station that orbited the planet, to implement the restoration process. Overseen by the Telosian Council, the Ithorian herd of Chodo Habat was chosen to manage the project. Telos and Citadel Station played a crucial part in the Jedi Exile's mission to end the First Jedi Purge, when the station was attacked by Sith forces under Darth Nihilus. In the wake of the battle, the Sith Triumvirate was defeated; this resulted in the eventual stabilization of the Republic.

The barren surface with its highly corrosive atmosphere was divided by a series of complex shield networks into Restoration Zones in which the Ithorians first stabilized the atmosphere and weather patterns, and later introduced various species of flora and fauna.

Many types of herbivores were imported, supplemented by the omnivorous cannoks from Dxun to maintain their population. At one point during the First Jedi Purge, the carefully controlled zones were wrested from the Ithorians and given to the Czerka Corporation.

For the purpose of implementing and monitoring the restoration progress, Citadel Station was constructed to orbit Telos; the immense structure would serve as a residence for the individuals associated with the project, control center, and headquarters of the Telosian Council, who would remain the governing body. The Ithorians, being well known across the galaxy as ecologists and agricultural engineers, were asked by the Telosian government to spearhead the planetary restoration program; in particular, the Council requested those belonging to the herdship of one Chodo Habat, a Force Adept who served as the spiritual and secular leader to his herd."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In orbit around Telos, the immense space station, powered by fuel shipped from the Peragus Mining Facility, served as the base of operations for the process of sectioning the surface into individual biospheres; the planetary shields formed an impregnable barrier that enabled weather stabilization processes to remove the acidic properties of the planet's devastated atmosphere. Under the management of the Ithorians, biological specimens were then introduced into the new zones from Onderon and Ithor, with many of the creatures being imported from Dxun, the jungle moon of Onderon, due to their extraordinary hardiness and ability to survive.

Restoration Zone RZ-0031 encompassed a diverse cross-section of Telos's terrain: beaches, canyons, gorges, hills, and grassland. Near the entrance to an abandoned Republic military base, the Ithorians had built an encampment of warehouses, processing plants, and a shuttle landing pad. Nevertheless, during the time of the First Jedi Purge, RZ-0031 became the center of controversy when control of the zone was taken away from the Ithorians and given to Czerka. Many of the Ithorian herd believed that Czerka's only interest in RZ-0031 was the recovery of raw materials in the military base. Although the base was technically deactivated, there were a number of military droids and gas traps protecting the structure, in addition to energy shields blocking many of the passages. Furthermore, the base housed a small transport shuttle and a central reactor that was necessary to power the control room and hangar doors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Telosian Polar Irrigation System and Jedi Academy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The northern polar region of Telos was the location for the central hub of the planet's world wide irrigation system. The destruction of the planet's surface during the Jedi Civil War devastated the irrigation system, although the central hub that resided within an ice plateau was largely untouched; nonetheless, the system was abandoned. The Jedi Order, fearing an attack on the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine and the loss of much of their knowledge, chose the polar irrigation facility as a site for a secret Jedi Academy and repository for historically valuable items. The Order reasoned that the Sith would have little reason to return to an already ravaged planet. The Academy had been built to be self-contained and the structure incorporated residential quarters, training room, storage areas, a private meditation chamber, and a hangar large enough to accommodate freighter-sized starships. In addition, the Academy included a central Jedi Council chamber arranged in a similar style to the Council chambers found in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Throughout the Jedi Civil War, many relics and Jedi holocrons were transported to the Academy until the ruination of the Jedi Enclave. The Academy remained virtually unpopulated until the disastrous Conclave on Katarr in the year 3956 BBY; Jedi Master Atris fled to the Telosian Jedi Academy with a collection of not only Jedi holocrons, but Sith holocrons as well."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Sacred places"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Telosian citizens were fiercely proud of the Sacred Places found throughout their planet. Two of the most well-loved national parks were approximately half a day's ride by swoop bike from Thani. The Mirror Caverns were a series of caves located deep in a forest glade, high in the snow-capped stone mountains. The name of the caverns was derived from the stone, malab, that lined the interior of the caves. Malab was a rare and highly prized mineral that had a lustrous black color and a very slick surface; many first-time visitors to the caverns would become disoriented by the shimmering blackness. Adjacent to the caverns could be found the Park of Sacred Pools, a series of small steam pools, edged with golden sand. The pools were fed by an underground spring, which also bubbled to the surface in small streams. The springs were a favorite of those Telosians needing physical relaxation after a long hike through the park."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Anglebay Station"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anglebay Station was a medical facility located in an isolated area of Telos. During the Galactic Civil War, the facility was recognized as politically neutral by the Empire; therefore, Imperial stormtroopers, Rebel soldiers, and various other unaffiliated individuals received treatment. The station was divided into several sections, including a computer records section that stored the treatment histories of former patients, and the in-patient bays, where current patients were quartered. The medical personnel included Humans, with droid orderlies augmenting the group. In the year 0 ABY, the station was destroyed by a former patient, Beilert Valance, who had been fitted with cybernetic parts at the facility during the Kwymar Suppressions.
