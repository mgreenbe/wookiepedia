Additionally the area was equipped with a visitors' section to accommodate diplomats waiting to confer with the Jedi High Council."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Erected within the Jedi Temple over its multiple expansions since the Temple's initial construction in 3996 BBY, the accommodation sector was completed in its modern form as of 1000 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 88.5 BBY, Padawans Dooku and Lorian Nod infiltrated the private room of Master Thame Cerulian in search of anything that would give Dooku a hint in to the mind of his new master. While perusing Cerulian's selection of holobooks, Dooku discovered a text revealing the process used to access the Dark Holocron stored within the Temple Library. Later, after news of the holocron's disappearance, Dooku rushed To Nod's room where he found the young man suffering from the effects of accessing the Sith artifact. Entering soon on the heels of Dooku was High Council member Oppo Rancisis who confiscated the artifact and instructed the two to wait for the High Council to summon them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the time of the series of robberies plaguing the Temple, Masters Qui-Gon Jinn and Tahl were assigned by the High Council to oversee the investigation. Meeting Tahl in her quarters, Jinn met her new assistant droid TooJay that was presented to the Knight after she lost her eyesight during the Mission to Melida/Daan. During the investigation Jinn's room was broken into by Bruck Chun, an apprentice working with the Dark Jedi Xanatos. While he didn't take anything, Tahl was able to detect a distinct odor in Jinn's room which she was able to trace back to the Lake Level. Later in Tahl's chambers, Jinn and his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi met with Padawan Siri Tachi regarding her knowledge of Chun's past. Jinn voiced his suspicion of Xanatos working with Chun, a suggestion that made Tahl weary. After Xanatos revealed himself, the Temple's energy systems started to fluctuate. The senior students' wing was suffering from extreme heat and had to be flushed by Knight Miro Daroon. Because of the threat to the students at the Temple, Jinn and Tahl ordered that they all move to the heart of the Temple and set up temporary dormitories. Soon after Jinn confronted Xanatos and was successful in driving him from the Temple. A short time later the dormitories reopened and the students returned to their rooms. After the death of Tahl, Jinn would wander the halls of the Temple during the early hours of the morning, only returning to his quarters to have Kenobi bring him sapir tea. On one such night, as it neared dawn, Master Yoda confronted Jinn and warned him of his disability to let go. Jinn took this simple scolding and the late night walks ended."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the 33 BBY Yinchorri Uprising, a group of Yinchorri warriors infiltrated the Jedi Temple in accordance to the mysterious Sith Lord Darth Sidious's plan. After entering the atrium of the High Council Tower, the Yinchorri rushed through the Temple and were met with no resistance. Searching the accommodations of the youngest Jedi in an attempt to wipe out the Order's next generation of warriors, the Yinchorri invaders were surprised to find them abandoned. Returning to the atrium they were ambushed by the Jedi Masters present in the Temple and all of the intruders were defeated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Master Anoon Bondara's quarters, Padawan Darsha Assant explained how she had failed her Jedi Trials in the Coruscant underworld. Assigned to recover the Fondorian Oolth, Assant had allowed him to fall to his death. Not believing he was dead, Master Bondara accompanied Assant to check the area for his body. On this mission, Bondara was attacked and killed by Darth Maul, the secret Sith apprentice of the elusive Darth Sidious."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amidst the battles of the Clone Wars, Temple life remained charged with lightsaber practice and military planning. Many diplomats and envoys were constantly moving in and out of the visitor's accommodations, having clearance to use the public areas of the Temple without a Jedi escort or guard. During the war, Governor Wilhuff Tarkin escorted an armored Boba Fett into the Temple at the behest of Anakin Skywalker. Claiming he had vital information for the Office of the Supreme Chancellor, Fett refused to reveal his identity as he wished to make a second assassination attempt on Mace Windu, the man who had killed his father. Sneaking out of his temporary room, Fett quickly made his way to the Council Members' level only to find Windu's quarters empty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Within the final months of the war, Padawan Whie Malreaux was stationed at the Temple with his master, Maks Leem. He was plagued by night terrors while he slept in the Temple's dormitories; within the dreams he saw a dark woman forcing him to kiss a wounded girl, and later his death at the hands of a lightsaber-wielding horror."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Clone Wars ended with Master Windu discovering the truth, Darth Sidious and Chancellor Palpatine were one and the same. Moving to arrest the Sith, Windu was killed by Jedi-turned-traitor Anakin Skywalker, now Darth Vader. In a move to catch the Jedi off their guard, Sidious instructed Vader to take the 501st Legion of the Grand Army of the Republic to seize the Temple and slaughter its occupants. While the senior Padawans and Knights were armed, many of the younglings hid in their rooms waiting for the raid to end. However, the Jedi protecting the dormitories were cut down and the clone troopers raced in and shot the children in their beds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the Temple was occupied by the Galactic Empire, ex-Jedi Ferus Olin infiltrated the Temple in an effort to find the rumored Jedi Prison. While using a service corridor from one of the Council spires, Olin went in the direction of the accommodation sector in order to position himself closer to the Room of a Thousand Fountains several levels below. While in the area, Olin and Flume noted that the accommodation sector wasn't as heavily damaged as the rest of the Temple."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Temple sat in the hands of the Sith for several decades, guarded by the trusted Shadow Troopers of the Empire.[source?] When Sidious and Vader were slain, the Empire lost balance and was eventually ousted from Coruscant. During the Yuuzhan Vong War Coruscant was devastated by terraforming, causing the Temple to crumble. Following the reclaiming of the world, the Galactic Alliance Chief of State, Cal Omas, ordered the Reconstruction Authority to rebuild the ancient edifice as a gift for the great sacrifices made by the Order against the Yuuzhan Vong."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rebuilt as it had been several decades before, the accommodation sector began to be filled with Padawans and Knights as the restored Jedi Order began to grow. In an area known as the Knights' Billet, Grand Master Luke Skywalker summoned Knights Tahiri Veila, Tesar Sebatyne, and Lowbacca to discuss their relationship with the nests of the Killiks. Deeming them to be Joiners and telling them that their judgment was skewed because of it, Skywalker exiled them to Dagobah for meditation and reflection."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Layout and style"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Located within the northwest corner of the Temple, the accommodation sector occupied the floors directly below the Jedi Archives and library. Separated into several different levels, the sector was made up of nurseries, youngling dormitories, the Knights' Billet, private rooms for the senior Knights and Masters, temporary residences for Knights in between assignments, and visitors' quarters for diplomats and politicians visiting the Temple. Like the rest of the Temple, the rooms had little furniture, providing only that which was necessary, and were pillared."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Overseen by older Jedi, the nurseries of the Temple were used to hold the youngest of the Initiates brought to Coruscant by the Acquisition Division. With age, the younglings would be sorted into clans and placed into dormitories which were monitored by a clan leader. The dormitories of the accommodation sector were large enough to accommodate an entire clan of initiates, each overseen by a Jedi Knight or Master. Once the Initiates were chosen to become Padawans they moved into slightly more private chambers within the dorms but were all on central hallway. These chambers were equipped with a small cot and a desk. All rooms were modeled to maintain an atmosphere suitable to the different species of Jedi within the Order. Padawan Bant Eerin was known to have a moist, humid atmosphere in her room at all times due to her Mon Calamari biology."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Young Knights were placed in the Knights Billet, a more spacious dorm environment which had a common room, snack annex, and lightsaber training dojo. After years of active duty, Knights who were regularly based out of the Temple would be afforded their own private quarters which had connections to the Archives and Library databases. Like the chambers of the Masters, the rooms had closets and bookcases disguised by slide away panels. Each room contained a sleep couch, a sofa, a workbench and a table with chairs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aside from the permanent residences, temporary living quarters were assigned to Jedi who took on long journey missions; during the Clone Wars, Jedi such as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker would be assigned these quarters as they were on constant assignment during the war. Like the other accommodations, the rooms were maintained by Temple employees and cleaning droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
