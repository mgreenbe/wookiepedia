He was the representative of a group of Sith soldiers during a hearing in the Ahto High Court that was the result of a brawl between his clients and a group of Republic soldiers. The neutrality laws of Manaan meant that open aggression between the warring sides was illegal on the planet, and so they were brought to trial for the incident. As the diplomat argued that his soldiers should not be punished for winning a fair fight, Revan, a Padawan of the Jedi Order, entered the court and witnessed the hearing. The Republic representative rebuked this claim, stating six against three was hardly a fair fight. The Republic agent informed the court that his men had been goaded into the fight, but the judges decreed that words were not sufficient provocation, and the Ahto City Civil Authority fined both the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic 10,000 credits for the incident."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Revan spoke with the diplomat at the conclusion of the trial, after which the diplomat complained about the treatment of the Sith on Manaan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The diplomat believed that Sith victory in the war was inevitable and that Manaan's native sentient species, the Selkath, should abandon their neutrality and align with the Sith, or they might be forced to do so in the future.
