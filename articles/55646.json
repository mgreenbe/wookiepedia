Vandrayk's fascination with the exogorths was purely scientific, but when he realized that his bosses at Adascorp were planning on weaponizing the beasts, Vandrayk fled in a junk-hauler called The Last Resort and took his indispensable knowledge with him. During his years on the run, Vandrayk met a young Offshoot named Jarael, who had spent much of her life in a slaving ring and wanted out. Vandrayk helped Jarael escape, and, in return, Jarael promised to protect Vandrayk as he grew more advanced in age.

When a large force of law enforcement and several Jedi Masters arrived in search of Carrick, Vandrayk took flight with Jarael, Carrick, and Hierogryph in The Last Resort and escaped pursuit. Although initially at odds, the group eventually grew close, and Vandrayk aided Carrick in his quest to find out exactly why his classmates were slain, and later in saving Carrick from execution when he briefly turned himself in to authorities. After leaving Taris behind, Jarael was mistaken for a Jedi and kidnapped by Mandalorian warriors on the planet Vanquo, during the Mandalorian attack on the planet as part of the Mandalorian Wars with the Galactic Republic.

There, she was discovered by Adascorp, which manipulated her into helping bring Vandrayk back to them. Holding them both aboard Adascorp's mobile headquarters, the Arkanian Legacy, Adascorp head Arkoh Adasca threatened Jarael's safety to force Vandrayk to finish the exogorth project he had abandoned decades earlier so that Adasca could then sell control of the exogorths to the highest bidder in a play to make Adascorp a galactic power. Partially due to the help of Zayne Carrick, who happened to be aboard the Arkanian Legacy as the prisoner of a Republic delegation, Adasca's plot was foiled. After years on the run, Vandrayk got the last laugh, ordering the exogorths to tear the Adascorp ship to pieces and end the Adasca line.

In the years prior to the Great Sith War, Vandrayk was recognized as an extremely promising and award-winning university student who impressed with his brilliance in biology, engineering, and cybernetics, and he was hired immediately after graduation by the Arkanian biotechnology titan Adascorp and set to work in the corporate labs. Around 3996 BBY, Doctor Vandrayk became the first to study the exogorths, a mysterious species of massive space slug that had been found in many disparate locations throughout the galaxy, in a clandestine Adascorp operation known as Project Black Harvest. Vandrayk led a scientific team inside a dormant exogorth and made a study of its brain, unlocking the secrets of the species\u2014they traveled between star systems in search of sustenance, going into a sort of hibernation while riding the solar winds to their destinations. Vandrayk eventually learned how to contact and control the minds of the exogorths, and also how to speed their reproduction, make them grow even larger, and propel them with hyperdrive implants. Vandrayk believed that if properly controlled, the exogorths could be used to efficiently refine ore and other raw materials."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After studying the exogorths, Vandrayk met with research director Artonian Dobonold and Argaloh Adasca, the Sixth Lord Adasca and the head of Adascorp.

When Vandrayk realized that Adasca was suggesting weaponizing the beasts, he decided that he wanted no part of it and immediately left the room\u2014that briefing would be Vandrayk's last with Adascorp, as he broke his contract and went on the run in a junk-hauler known as The Last Resort. Hunted by Adascorp, who had placed a sizable bounty on his head, Vandrayk at some point did business with a notorious slaving ring known as the Crucible. He encountered a young Offshoot named Jarael, who had grown up as a slave in the Crucible and had spent some years as a slaver until she had finally had enough. Vandrayk helped Jarael escape her life in the Crucible, and she became his constant companion, pledging herself to protect Vandrayk as he aged and his mental faculties diminished."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "On the run with Zayne Carrick"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vandrayk and Jarael eventually took up residence in a run-down section of the planet Taris' Lower City known as Junk Junction, a site they chose because it was large and open enough to conceal The Last Resort. The Offshoots set traps within Junk Junction's mounds of debris to deter visitors and, surrounding their ship with tents and awnings, disguised The Last Resort as their home. Known to the world by the nickname \"Camper,\" Vandrayk spent his days fiddling with droids and with The Last Resort itself, tinkering with the ship so much that he had lost track what he had done to which systems. Among Vandrayk's additions to The Last Resort were secret smuggling compartments known as \"Camper specials,\" which could conceal multiple people inside. Vandrayk and Jarael took to selling Vandrayk's inventions to put food on the table, while Jarael worked as a day laborer at a Kedorzhan reclamation plant. Although the two purposely avoided the local swoop gangs in the area, Vandrayk sure enough became known in the Tarisian underworld for refitting old escape pods into shipping containers that could be used for covert transport\u2014at one point, Vandrayk, at the behest of small-time Snivvian hood Marn Hierogryph, helped conceal wanted criminal Zovius Mendu within a crate of dried dreeka fish to be shipped to Corellia.

After he escaped pursuit with \"accomplice\" Hierogryph, Carrick became the most wanted man on Taris. Remembering the role Vandrayk played in helping Zovius Mendu evade justice, Hierogryph brought Carrick with him to Junk Junction, seeking Vandrayk's help again. Upon their approach, however, they set off one of Vandrayk's traps and incurred the wrath of Jarael, who attacked and injured Carrick with her shockstaff. As Hierogryph unsuccessfully pleaded with Vandrayk to help them, The Last Resort was found by a law enforcement ship searching for Carrick, which contained Constable Noana Sowrs and several Jedi Masters from the Jedi Tower. Vandrayk immediately bolted up to The Last Resort's cockpit and raised ship with Carrick and Hierogryph aboard, escaping into outer space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was a short trip. The Last Resort had not flown in years, and the vessel lost power quickly after clearing the planet's atmosphere. As patrol ships approached, Vandrayk powered the ship back up, evading pursuit by flying into the Taris system's asteroid belt. The whole experience was too much for Vandrayk, who collapsed from exhaustion, believing that Adascorp had again come for him. The next day, the group traveled to the rogue moon, an anomalous planetoid within the asteroid belt that was constantly bombarded by meteorites\u2014it was the last place Carrick and friends had all been together with their Masters before the massacre occurred, and Carrick was hoping to learn more about what precipitated the killings. Vandrayk dropped off Carrick and Jarael on the rogue moon's surface, then brought the ship around to the other side of the moon, as The Last Resort did not have functioning shields and would shortly be obliterated if it stayed where it was. Carrick soon found the remnants of T1-LB, a bulk-loading droid that been with the Jedi Masters on the rogue moon and which might have had a clue as to what had propelled the Masters to kill their students. Shortly after they found the droid, however, Carrick and Jarael were cornered by the Masters and law enforcement, who had tracked them to the moon.

After getting T1-LB back up and running, Vandrayk accessed a holographic recording of the droid's final moments, which revealed that the Masters had killed their students after having a Force vision that they believed depicted one of their Padawans bringing about the return of the Sith and the fall of the Jedi Order. T1-LB then relived his destruction at the hands of Master Lucien Draay and flew into a distressed rampage that Vandrayk was forced to calm down. Only a few moments later, The Last Resort found itself caught in a tractor beam, captured by a ship that Hierogryph recognized as the Oroko, belonging to local bounty hunter Valius Ying.

Vandrayk modified one of The Last Resort's environment suit with a trick helmet and an audio recording that would disguise Jarael as the Sith from the Jedi's vision and disturb the Jedi Masters. Jarael was then sent into the Jedi Tower wielding Carrick's lightsaber, which he had left behind on the Oroko, under covering fire from The Last Resort.

Vandrayk hijacked the camp's distress channel, while Jarael posed as Jedi Master Q'Anilia\u2014one of the Taris Jedi Masters hunting for Carrick\u2014informing the miners that the Mandalorians had landed on Vanquo.

Jarael, who still was in possession of Carrick's lightsaber, was mistaken for a Jedi and captured after a brief fight, and Carrick had to physically restrain Vandrayk from going after her. Vandrayk was overcome by shock and grief and had to be carried to The Last Resort by T1-LB, who charged through a host of Mandalorian invaders on the way there. Once they reached the ship, they were overtaken by a Mandalorian captain, who attempted to steal the vessel and fly away. T1-LB managed to get a grip on the ship's loading ramp as The Last Resort took off, and the group was narrowly able to climb aboard before the ramp was raised."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vandrayk immediately charged the cockpit, attacking the Mandalorian with Jarael's shockstaff and quickly gaining the upper hand, before casting the intruder down into the cargo hold, where T1-LB immobilized him. Vandrayk took control of The Last Resort and fled into hyperspace toward Mandalorian Space, tracking a homing device built into Jarael's bracelet. Once the Mandalorian heard that they were headed into Mandalorian territory, he spoke up and offered to help. Introducing himself as shock infantryman Rohlan Dyre, the Mandalorian revealed that Jarael was being taken to the Flashpoint Stellar Research Station, where the Mandalorian biologist Demagol was experimenting on captured Jedi to determine the source of their abilities. Although Dyre believed that saving Jarael was an impossible task, Vandrayk and Carrick refused to let her go."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Instead, Carrick came up with a plan.

Once Carrick was taken back to Demagol's office, Dyre incapacitated the scientist and freed Carrick, and the former Padawan switched into Demagol's armor. Once \"Demagol\" and Dyre walked outside, the Mandalorian station received a holographic message from Hierogryph, who was posing as a Republic admiral. After Carrick surreptitiously used the Force to attach scavenged Vanquo mining charges to the camp's solar shield generator and a number of captured Republic ships, \"Admiral\" Hierogryph set off explosions that rocked the camp and scared the Mandalorians into fleeing the planet. Jarael and the rest of the Jedi were saved.

As Hierogryph could not leave the ship for fear of being recognized and arrested, Vandrayk ventured forth disguised as a \"Baron Hyro Margryph,\" a wealthy recycling magnate whose account was mistakenly frozen, owing to his name's similarity to that of the wanted criminal Hierogryph. Although Vandrayk mistakenly left the document with the thirty-digit account access code on the ship, he surprised everyone by remembering the code anyway. Suddenly, however, a pair of Ithorian bounty hunters emerged from the bushes and made off with their banker, a man named Arvan. Vandrayk and Jarael gave chase along with Carrick and Hierogryph, the latter of whom recognized the description of the hunters as the Moomo Brothers, who were known in underworld circles for their incompetence and stupidity. Vandrayk had to pull out of the chase after suffering a faint spell, and, while the Moomo Brothers escaped with the banker, Carrick got close enough to recognize the Moomos' prisoner as his father."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Knowing that the banker was actually Carrick's father made the situation more dire for the group, and they formulated a plan to save Arvan Carrick from captivity aboard the Moomos' ship, the Moomo Williwaw. With Vandrayk posing as Carrick, the crew of The Last Resort confused the Moomos into fighting one another, which allowed Carrick and his father to slip away. Once they safely shepherded Carrick's father onto The Last Resort, they succeeded in obtaining their money and were soon on their way. In 3963 BBY, with Carrick setting off on his own mission to clear his name, the crew of The Last Resort decided that it was time to split up. To this end, the group made its way to the planet Ralltiir, where Vandrayk caught Hierogryph trying to sell some of his projects as valuable artwork\u2014once Hierogryph promised to cut him in on the deal, Vandrayk allowed the Snivvian to proceed. Vandrayk and Jarael eventually dropped off the two fugitives on Ralltiir, where Vandrayk gifted Carrick a pair of phrikite vambraces that he had personally made before they parted. In return, Hierogryph gave Vandrayk and Jarael a crate of hyperdrive parts the ship desperately needed. However, Vandrayk and Jarael got more than they bargained for with the package: an HK-24 assassin droid, sent by Vandrayk's former employers at Adascorp, had stowed away inside the crate and attacked once The Last Resort had gone into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the HK-24 succeeded in taking down Vandrayk despite resistance from Jarael and T1-LB, another stowaway emerged to save the day\u2014 Demagol, disguised as Rohlan Dyre, who had been hiding on the ship since Flashpoint, revealed himself and destroyed the droid.

As Vandrayk laid incapacitated aboard The Last Resort, Jarael took the ship to Arkania in the hopes that someone there would be able to help him. Jarael tried to evade Arkanian discrimination against Offshoots by disguising herself as a pureblood Arkanian and bribed a doctor into helping her get a diagnosis for Vandrayk, but Adascorp recognized its former employee's genetic profile from the sample Jarael provided and saw its opportunity to bring Vandrayk back into the fold. Lord Arkoh Adasca, Argaloh Adasca's grandson and the new head of Adascorp, brought Jarael aboard his flagship, the Arkanian Legacy, and promised to help Vandrayk if Jarael led them to him, a proposal that Jarael accepted.

The existence of the virus was a lie\u2014what was ailing Vandrayk was actually molds and allergens running through the air circulation on The Last Resort, from which he recovered quickly after coming aboard the Arkanian Legacy.

To this end, Vandrayk was forced to help a team of Adascorp scientists affix with implants a large number of exogorths near the star Omonoth to bring them under their control, in preparations for Adasca's sales pitch and demonstration for the interested parties. Once the work was done, Vandrayk retreated to his control station's spacesuit stowage closet and contacted Jarael, still held aboard the Arkanian Legacy, over her locator bracelet. Jarael apprised Vandrayk of what was happening on the ship, including the presence of Zayne Carrick, while Vandrayk informed Jarael that Adascorp had for years been actively working to wipe out the Offshoot population.
