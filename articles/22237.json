As a clone cadet, Echo was part of the squad Domino Squad, overseen by the Siniteen bounty hunter Bric. Echo stayed with Domino Squad until the unit passed their final test; the completion of the test allowed the members of Domino Squad to become battle-ready clone troopers. For his first off-world assignment, Echo stood guard at Rishi Station, a listening post located on the moon of Rishi, where he and other rookie clone troopers were stationed. When the Confederate General Grievous implemented an attack on the Rishi Station to capture it before proceeding to Kamino.

For their simulation battles, each clone cadet, including Echo, used non-lethal weapons so no clone could be injured during one of their simulations.

There, Echo told his squad that they should follow orders and not mess around. While the other Domino Squad members mocked Echo's words, Hevy did not enjoy their conversation. When he said that he thought \"like an ARC trooper,\" Echo questioned him, which angered Hevy. Their heated debate turned into a fight, but the brawl was broken up by the immediate arrival of Bric. While Echo quickly apologized to Bric, Hevy dismissed the sergeant. Bric wanted his team to cooperate with each other, and, if they remain the same, they were a waste of his time.

At one point, when Echo joined the other stationed rookie troopers in the control room of the listening post, Sergeant O'Niner entered the room and alerted the clone troopers of a routine inspection that would soon commence.

After the three rookie troopers obeyed and removed their protective headgear, another Rishi moon eel attacked them. This time, Rex used his DC-17 hand blaster to kill it with one shot to the eye, a feat that impressed the rookies. When talking with the rookie troopers, Rex dubbed them \"shinies,\" a derogatory term referring to the troopers' spotless armor that had not yet seen action in battle.

Upon entering the command center, the clones defeated the droid units, including their vibroblade-wielding leader. However, their victory was cut short when the clone troopers noticed that General Grievous's fleet had arrived above the moon. Due to the lack of response from the commando droids, Grievous sent more battle droids to the listening post. The clones, inside the command center of the listening post, were unable to turn off the \"all clear\" signal because the droids had hot-wired it.

When the invasion began, Trident ships, led by the Confederate General Grievous and Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress, climbed the outside structures of Tipoca City. As the ships caused structural damage to the buildings, due to their drills, battalions of B1-Series battle droids and Aqua droids exchanged fire with stationed clone troopers. On the bridge, Echo and Fives utilized their carbine blasters to shoot down the nearby droids. After 99 visited the two clones and resupplied them with ammo and thermal detonators, battle droids stormed the area, although they were destroyed when Echo tossed a detonator at them.

Echo tried to boost the clone cadets' confidence by saying since Kamino was their home, they should defend it. 99 entered the conversation by telling the clones that he knew where the complex's armory room was, and if the clones could gather enough supplies, they would be able to hold off the droids. With the decision made, 99 gathered the supplies, and each of the clones equipped themselves with a firearm. Echo and the clones stood behind a door, which led to a sleeping barrack room, and waited for any droid to walk by. Nearby, Grievous led a group of droids down the same hallway the clones where in. After the cyborg General ordered the droids to open the doors, a droid opened the clones' door, which revealed them.

Yet, battle droids noticed the fleeing 99, and fired at him, killing him instantly. Despite witnessing 99's death, Echo and the remaining clones destroyed the remainder of Grievous' droids.

As they orchestrated their plan, the team knew that any attack on the facility which contained the captive Piell\u2014a well-guarded Confederate prison known as the Citadel\u2014would be rendered useless due to its security. Skywalker devised a plan of encasing Echo and the team in carbonite in order to avoid detection, as the facility's security utilized life-form scanners; then his astromech droid, R2-D2, along with a group of reprogrammed B1 battle droids would fly the carbonite blocks to the Citadel. After the meeting, Echo and the team departed to the Temple's hangar bay, where a carbon-freezing chamber, maintained by Ugnaughts, was located.

After entering one of the Citadel's detention area hallways, the team found out that the walls surrounding the team contained hidden blaster turrets. Once the turrets revealed themselves to the group, the Jedi utilized their lightsabers to deflect the blaster fire, while Echo and the clones fired at the turrets. The turrets were not the only trap the hallway contained, however; Longshot witnessed an electricity field that was approaching from the distance. While Echo and the others evaded the field, Longshot was not so lucky, as he was instantly killed after being hit by the electric field.
