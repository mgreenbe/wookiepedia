They had a presence on the planet Cato Neimoidia and in about 17 BBY they entered an arrangement with the Hutt crime lord Darga Jiramma Mionne wherby Darga would supply them with slaves that he had acquired as a result of a deal that he had made with the Galactic Empire. However, the slaves that Darga supplied were of poor quality and many of them died before the Iron Ring could sell them, so an Iron Ring delegation traveled to Darga's palace on Cato Neimoidia, to complain. A short time later, Darga's majordomo Igren Demos persuaded two Iron Rings to assist in an assassination attempt against some undercover Alderaanian Resistance agents that were staying in the palace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
