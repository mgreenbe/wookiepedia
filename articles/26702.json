A warming cushion sat on the droid's bulbous, silver body, while two nutrient reservoirs were maintained to ensure the baby was well-fed. The padded droid was powered by an anti-gravity repulsorlift, located in a spherical compartment below the main body. The midwife droid was fitted with two large, soft cradling paddles for use upon delivery of the newborn.

Thus, when Padm\u00e9 Amidala was brought to Polis Massa expecting twins, the Kallidahin physicians consulted their medical databanks to find a droid able to deliver Human children.
