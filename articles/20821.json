It was a modified IrizMark-8 Sentinel-class military cruiser. It was outfitted with two ion cannons, a pair of assault laser cannons, and two tractor beam generators. Because of its small size, Broken Jaw was often escorted by larger craft. It made up for its size, however, with excellent maneuverability and speed. The ship could hold up to forty pirates and 8,000 tons of cargo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
