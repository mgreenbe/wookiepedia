Under the command of General Grievous, the Collections and Security Division was reorganized along with other droid armies into more effective fighting forces. It was deactivated, along with most of the CIS battle droids, when Darth Vader activated the master control signal after assassinating San Hill and the rest of the Separatist Council."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Forces"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle droids"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Vehicles"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Organic Forces"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Starships"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Organization"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ground forces of the Collections and Security Division were divided into two groups.
