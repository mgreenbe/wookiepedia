In 32 BBY, Gunray took his force to Naboo, and blockaded the planet as a way of protesting against the Galactic Senate's newly passed taxation of trade routes. Soon enough, he had his army invade Naboo. When the capital city of Theed was captured, so too was the planet's leader, Queen Amidala. 3B3-21 was originally assigned to escort the captured Queen, but the task was eventually carried out by a group of OOM security battle droids. Amidala later escaped from the droids thanks to the aid of two Jedi Knights, but the Federation's occupation of Theed and Naboo continued."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Amidala was able to mount an attack on the Theed Royal Palace, where the Viceroy was staying. 3B3-21 was a part of the force that attempted to defend the palace from the Queen's incursion force. He and his fellow battle droids fought the Naboo natives in one of the Palace's spacious corridors, but the Queen and her soldiers were able to bypass the droids by scaling an outer wall to reach the level above. Shortly afterward, the Droid Control Ship orbiting Naboo and controlling all Federation droids on the planet was destroyed, which resulted in the instantaneous deactivation of the droids themselves. Amidala was able to capture Gunray, putting an end to the Federation's occupation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Manufactured by Baktoid Combat Automata, 3B3-21 had white plating, black photoreceptors, masculine programming, and, like all B1 battle droids, stood 1.91 meters tall. 3B3-21 was equipped with command programs that allowed him to summon reinforcements to his designated patrol zone.
