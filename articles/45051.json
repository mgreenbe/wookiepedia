Nihil Tempest Runner Kassav Milliko, who had been given data on upcoming Emergences by Eye of the Nihil Marchion Ro, attempted to use the Emergence to extort credits from Eriaduan Governor Mural Veen, promising to destroy the incoming hyperspace debris if she paid up. After several transports carrying lommite ore were destroyed by debris, and with the news that the next debris would strike Eriadu's inhabited moon, Veen reluctantly paid Milliko the fifty million credits he had demanded. However, the crew of Milliko's flagship New Elite was unable to reach and destroy the debris in time and it struck the moon, causing many deaths. The Eriaduans had extensively scanned Milliko's starship before he was forced to retreat, which allowed the Galactic Republic to identify him. Veen swore vengeance upon Milliko, eventually personally killing the pirate during the Battle of Kur."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
