At some point after the Battle of Endor, its crew consisted of first mate Quiggold, the Ishi Tib Pendewqell, the Arcona Reeg Brosna, the Twi'lek Reveth, and the Gamorrean Squeaky, all of whom called the planet Ponemah Terminal home. On Ponemah, the crew became involved in a race for the lost treasure of the Sith Lord Count Dooku, during which Pendewqell was killed and Brosna was lost in a sandstorm.
