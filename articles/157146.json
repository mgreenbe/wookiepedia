However, Solo had hidden the real jewels and given fakes to the exiles, thereby saving the planet from destruction according to the priest's beliefs.

In the confusion, the priest, who was dying of wounds he experienced during the fight, released the other crimson jewel. With one jewel exposed without its partner, it unleashed a deadly effect known as the Crimson Forever on the crew of the Mining Explorer.
