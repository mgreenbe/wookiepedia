The imposters arrived on Vaced to meet with their escort, the Jedi Nuru Kungurama and were killed by a sniper. In the aftermath of the battle at Bilbringi Depot, the real Pikkson, Sunmantle, and Sommilor were discovered tied up in their TL-1800 freighter's hold. Pikkson and Sunmantle then piloted the freighter to Coruscant, landing at the Senate Building. While Sommilor was led to a meeting with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, the two KynacTech pilots took Kungurama and his clone trooper Breakout Squad to the Jedi Temple. En route, Jedi Master Harro Kelpura received notification that his research lab in the Dacho District had been broken into, and ordered a change of course. Once there, the freighter was impacted by a dropship belonging to a bounty hunter assisting in the break-in. The ship was damaged and crashed. Kungurama ordered Pikkson to take off, but the landing gear had been snagged. Kungurama cleared it and they took off again, but upon approaching the lab, they were hit by a missile, causing Breakout Squad to fall out.
