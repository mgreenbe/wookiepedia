He was then sold to a great Imperial-backed resource company and sent to Hintivan II, a frigid, forest world. For years, he worked felling trees in the northern part of the planet with a vibro-ax. Due to the work, he became a big, stout man."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Piran eventually earned enough money to buy his own freedom, and then decided to send his skills and knowledge of slavery rings to the highest bidder. His new company was the Mytaranor Slaving Council, and during this time he used his old vibro-ax as a personal weapon, and a snowtrooper chest plate he \"obtained\" on Hintivan. He also began favoring short black hair."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Piran was prompted among the slavers in little time, and he became the assistant of the chief slavemaster. He was more efficient than his boss, and eventually replaced him.

He was seen by Rebel Alliance officer Derembus Sitnalta, Alton Lochner, and Sasnak Toxis. Sasnak noticed that one of the slaves was a person he knew, and he had disliked Chordak for a time. The event became a fight until the prefect arrived; the Rebels ran away and the slaves were freed. Due to this, Piran kept a grudge towards those three Rebels, or so Sitnalta thought."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Talas Piran acquired the Mandalorian Dungeon Ship Vanquisher during a business trip to Kessel, some years before 2 ABY.
