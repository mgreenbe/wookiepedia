In 1 BBY, the freighter, carrying a group of Rebels, including the wounded special operative Jan Ors, and stolen Imperial fuel slugs, docked with the Datch family-owned Pellezara station in the Duro system for maintenance while on the run from Imperial pursuit. Tarrin, while working on the freighter, eventually uncovered the vessel's affiliation. Knowing he could not let the stolen cargo fall back into Imperial hands, Datch commandeered the freighter while its Rebel crew, save for Ors, was still aboard the station, and helped it reach Rebel sanctuary. Datch then decided to leave his life on Pellezara station behind and went on to enlist in the Rebel cause himself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
