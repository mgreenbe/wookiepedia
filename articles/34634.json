He ascended to the twelve-member ruling body sometime between 3984 and 3974 BBY, and by the year 3954 BBY, he had served on the Council longer than any other member besides Darth Xedrix. Igrol resided on the planet Dromund Fels instead of the Empire's capital of Dromund Kaas, though he was summoned to the Imperial Citadel with eight other Dark Councilors in 3950 BBY for a meeting with the Sith Emperor. The Emperor promptly killed the Dark Councilors mere hours before his Imperial Guard purged the remaining three, including Darth Nyriss, because five of the Councilors had participated in a conspiracy against the Emperor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Igrol was first mentioned in Drew Karpyshyn's 2011 novel The Old Republic: Revan, as one of the three members of the Dark Council at the time who receive a name."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
