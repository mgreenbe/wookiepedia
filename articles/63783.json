The bubble functioned by projecting a membrane-field which displaced water and prevented the entry of foreign objects through the bubble's except at specific entry portals. The base of each bubble was comprised of a lightweight alloy lattice and transparisteel that contained the bubble's generator. Varying in size, the average-sized bubbles were projected by utanodes; while larger versions were generated by a kernode assembly.\n The underside of the base consisted of a long, pointed spire where counterweights and repulsor field generators worked to keep the bubble upright and stable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The evolution of the technology eventually saw it adapted for use in vehicles and military shields."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary, they are referred to as hydrostatic force field bubbles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
