Bane is the lone survivor of the Battle of Ruusan, in which Lord Skere Kaan's thought bomb destroyed the entire Brotherhood of Darkness and most of the Jedi Knights on the planet. Bane is accompanied in his journey by the unwelcome ghostly avatar of Lord Qordis, one of the Sith who perished in the battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Qordis chides Darth Bane for abandoning the Sith, while Darth Bane is concerned about carrying on the Sith legacy. As Darth Bane approaches Dxun, the beast moon of Onderon, the spirit of Qordis shuts down all of the Valcyn's systems.

Bane continues through the jungle, slaying a jungle creature and then encountering the spirit of Lord Kaan. Bane follows Lord Kaan until he reaches the pyramidal tomb of Freedon Nadd.

Darth Bane suppresses the pain and immerses himself in the knowledge found in the Sith holocron. Much later (probably days), Darth Bane emerges from the tomb invigorated with dark-side knowledge and power. He decides to revive the Sith, but using the Rule of Two Sith at a time.
