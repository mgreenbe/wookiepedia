They had once come into contact with Gonster who was known for his skill in dealing with monstrous beasts. The Dragon Riders had apparently appealed to the Gonster to help rid them of a terrifying beast known as the Hoosha. However, the Gonster could not agree over whether that particular monster had been related with the Dragon Riders or with the Duloks, so it's possible that the Gonster had aided the Dragon Riders with a completely unrelated beast."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
