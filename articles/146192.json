Emshwa led a diplomatic mission to the planet Ithor in order to win the Ithorians over to the new government. However, their CR90 corvette Starfall was captured by the Super Star Destroyer Annihilator, which had been taken over by the pirate leader Eleodie Maracavanya. Emshwa and the crew were allowed to leave in the ship's escape pods but the Starfall and its cargo of food, medicine, technology and Ithorian artifacts were seized by Maracavanya's pirates.
