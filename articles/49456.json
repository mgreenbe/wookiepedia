A lifter typically consisted of two large air canisters mounted on a frame. Between the canisters was hung a sling, upon which items could be placed. When manually moved into position, water would be let into the tanks to sink the device. Once the desired objects were loaded aboard, the water was expelled, allowing the lifter to rise. Haileycraft manufactured the MaxMode Lifter, which was available during the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
