When he was just 4 years of age, he sensed a danger that caused him to leap out of the way moments before a building collapsed claiming the lives of his parents. Brought to the Jedi Temple as a Youngling, he began studying the ways of the Force. However, due to his internal emotional conflict over the deaths of his parents, he left the Temple while still a Padawan. Having departed from the Jedi academy, he entered into the Galactic Republic military and showed superior skill in tactics and strategy. During battles, Porpman was able to feel the flow of the conflict as it unfolded and react with seeming precognition."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime during his life, he adopted religious beliefs that impelled him to wear his hair in an atypical fashion for military personnel, being shaved on the sides and back with the rest of his hair on the top growing down in a two foot braid.
