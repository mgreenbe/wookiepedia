Members of this family included the light sided Cay Qel-Droma and the dark sided Ulic Qel-Droma. This belt increased the wearer's connection to the Force, while conferring protection from its influence. It is believed that the belt may have come into the possession of the Jedi Exile sometime toward the end of the Dark Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
