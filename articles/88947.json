A group led by Lieutenant Varias, including Sergeant Mener, Officers Hirka, Kener and Savas, and several CorSec troopers, was dispatched from Coronet to investigate. The unit discovered an old and fully automated droid factory, presumably built in secret by the Separatists during the Clone Wars. The CorSec ignored that the factory had been reactivated by IG-88 for his project of Droid Revolution."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droid factory was defended by many hostile battle droids but the Corellian government was reluctant to send reinforcement since it would like to avoid drawing the attention of the Galactic Empire. Independent spacers were thus recruited to assist the CorSec in the factory. As Sergeant Mener was tasked to lead the fight against the droids, he enrolled several spacers to destroy as many droids as possible. The spacers destroyed more than two dozens of droids, including B1-Series battle droids, B2 super battle droids, and droidekas. The spacers also fought an epic battle against a very powerful prototype of an EV-series-like battle droid. Eventually, the CorSec and the spacers would successfully manage to shut down the Corellia Droid Factory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sergeant Mener was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
