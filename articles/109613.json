Master Mace Windu of the Jedi Order searched for the Padawans but was captured by Kyossk and Quia. They brought him before Guattako once his lightsaber was broken, planning to broadcast Windu's execution across the galaxy so the Jedi's death could inspire many new converts into his cause.\nHowever, as the pair argued about the ethics of Guattako's cause, Windu revealed that he had sent Force signals to his comrades in the Jedi Order and used the Force to reconstruct his lightsaber. After Guattako killed by Windu she was arrested with the other henchmen of the Warlord."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
