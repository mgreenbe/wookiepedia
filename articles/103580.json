It had become necessary because there was no longer any arable land left on the entire planet. Development had eliminated all of Coruscant's plant life, which had once helped to maintain the air quality. A large number of the atmospheric scrubbing stations employed genetically engineered organisms that could consume toxic gases and chemicals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
