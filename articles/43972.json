It was more deadly than the Krytos virus which killed millions of aliens on the planet Coruscant following the New Republic capture of Coruscant in 6 ABY. It was said to be so horrible that even Emperor Palpatine feared to deploy it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This plague was stored at an uncharted asteroid known as the Emperor's plague storehouse. In 24 ABY, a sample of it was obtained by an information broker, Fonterrat, who sold it to Nolaa Tarkona. During the Battle of the Emperor's Plague Storehouse, a team of Jedi, with Bornan Thul, destroyed all canisters containing the disease along with other alien-specific plagues, stopping the Diversity Alliance's genocidal anti-human crusade."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
