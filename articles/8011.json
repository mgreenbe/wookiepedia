Developed around 15 ABY, pulse-lifters were an alternative to the commonly used repulsorlifts. The pulse-lifters created massive shockwaves and sonic disruptions, preventing them being used in high traffic areas. They were sufficiently rare to draw the interest of New Republic military officials when used on Yevethan Aramadia-class thrustships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
