The following day, the pair were randomly selected by the guards for the day's work shift and removed from their cell to be chained into a turbo-tank used by the camp as a prisoner transport. The alien did not make eye contact with any of the other three prisoners that were accompanying them, which Erso took to mean that Musters would have no allies in her attempt on her life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Musters never had a chance to attempt to kill Erso however, as before the tank reached its destination it was attacked by a squad of Alliance Special forces troopers who were searching for Erso. The rebels quickly blew the door off the vehicle, shocking Musters, and killed each of the three stormtroopers guarding the prisoners. They then freed their target, who hit Rebel Sergeant Ruescott Melshi with a spade and promptly tried to escape from her saviors, fleeing past Musters as the alien stood up. Erso made it out of the tank before being stopped by the reprogrammed KX-series security droid K-2SO. Erso was then taken back to the Alliance's base on the moon Yavin 4."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Musters was then able to escape from Imperial custody as well and made her way to Jedha City on the moon Jedha. While in one of the city's streets she and other civilians had to stand aside to allow an Imperial patrol including a \"Occupier\" combat assault tank to pass by. As the patrol passed by Musters it was attacked by members of the rebel leader Saw Gerrera's partisans, causing most civilians in the street to flee. Shortly after this attack, Jedha city was destroyed by the Empire's Death Star superweapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Oolin Musters was a member of the Blutopian species with gray and brown leathery skin and tentacles protruding from their pinched, worm-like faces. Her cellmate Jyn Erso never bothered to learn Musters' real name, species or gender, but used female pronouns to describe the alien. Musters moaned and wheezed while she slept, and while awake spoke with a voice that sounded like claws on a slate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Erso woke late at night causing Musters to also wake, the alien told her cellmate to go back to sleep and then asked her if she wanted a warning before she was killed.
