In the year 5 ABY, she attended a meeting to discuss her peoples' future on board the flotilla's Alderaanian escort frigate Sunspire while the flotilla was floating amongst the remains of Alderaan in the Alderaan system. At the meeting, Valmor argued that the flotilla should remain where their home had once been, while others argued that they should leave to resettle another world. The argument ended when several New Republic vessels arrived in the system to deliver the remains of the Death Star superweapon, which Valmor declared could be used to build a new space station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eglyn Valmor was a human female native of the planet Alderaan who survived the destruction of her homeworld by the Galactic Empire's Death Star superweapon in the year 0 BBY.
