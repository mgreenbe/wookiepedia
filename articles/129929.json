Specialized spherical containers for the beverage were created specifically for Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, a theme park land that opened to guests at Disneyland Park and Disney's Hollywood Studios in 2019. The themed packaging was developed as part of a collaboration between Walt Disney Imagineering, Lucasfilm Ltd., and The Coca-Cola Company, which has had a partnership with Disneyland since 1955. The specially-packaged drink was revealed during the \"Bringing Star Wars to Life at Disney Parks\" panel at Star Wars Celebration Chicago in April 2019, which debuted an advertisement featuring a crate full of Sprite, Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, and Dasani beverages being stolen from two distracted First Order stormtroopers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As part of a creative process that lasted more than three years, Coca-Cola Design presented concepts for the bottles in various shapes and sizes before settling on the rustic orbs found in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge. Matt Cooper, an associate industrial designer at Coca-Cola, stated that the intention behind the final design was to evoke a sense that the bottles had just been offloaded from a ship or abandoned and repurposed into drink containers. The Aurebesh logos of the soda brands originated when a group of Imagineers toured the Coke Archives in Atlanta, Georgia and saw the iconic Spencerian script Coca-Cola logo in various languages."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
