The shadows would then be matched to the shadows of known computer languages to recreate the data. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, it was seventy-eight percent effective."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The HOS was served by Tech 4 PDVs that entered hyperspace, tracking the scanner through triangulations of known locations, a process that took hours to complete. Transfer of data from the PDV to the HOS, or effecting repairs to the HOS, had to be conducted in realspace, which was a vulnerable time for both apparatus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
