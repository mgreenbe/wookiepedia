By 3964 BBY, he had become captain of the starship Oroko, with several crew serving under him, and became acquainted with local Snivvian hood Marn Hierogryph. At some point, Ying hired the Ithorian bounty hunters known as the Moomo Brothers for a job, only to fire them because of their incompetence. During his time as a pirate, Ying was captured by Republic Captain Saul Karath on the ship Reciprocity, although he had resumed his operations by 3964 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That year, Jedi Padawan Zayne Carrick was accused of the murder of four of his fellow classmates on the planet Taris. Carrick went on the run with the help of Hierogryph, and a large bounty was placed on their heads. Not normally bounty hunters, Ying and the crew of the Oroko joined in on the hunt for Carrick and Hierogryph, eventually finding them in the Taris asteroid belt. The two fugitives were aboard the junk hauler Last Resort, which the Oroko captured with its tractor beam. Along with Carrick and Hierogryph, Ying and the Oroko also brought aboard Jarael and Gorman \"Camper\" Vandrayk, the Arkanian Offshoot owners of The Last Resort. Soon afterward, Ying made a deal with Hierogryph\u2014in exchange for the codes to Hierogryph's Taris storehouses, Ying would tell the authorities that The Last Resort had been destroyed in the asteroid belt, and that he had found Carrick alone in an escape pod. Ying would then allow Hierogryph, Jarael and Camper to go free once they reached Taris."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Ying and the Oroko returned to Taris with their \"guests\" in tow, Ying took a shuttle down to Taris's Upper City with Carrick, who was restrained in handcuffs, intending to bring the runaway Padawan to the five Jedi Masters stationed at the local Jedi Tower. Ying and Carrick were greeted by a massive crowd and heavy press coverage\u2014reports on the event were broadcast as far away as the planet Dantooine. Ying paraded Carrick through the throng of spectators to the Tower, where he and his prisoner were scanned for weapons and recording devices before being allowed to meet with the Masters. Ying told the Masters his false story of having found Carrick in a lifepod, but the Miraluka Jedi Q'Anilia immediately saw through the lie. To Ying's surprise, Lucien Draay, Carrick's Master, admitted that Carrick had not actually killed his classmates, but that he was what the Masters wanted all the same. Furious, Carrick and Draay argued, revealing intimate and secret details of the fateful night, and Ying learned that the five Masters had actually killed the Padawans and framed Carrick after he narrowly escaped death at their hands. Disturbed by these revelations, Ying attempted to take his leave and return to his shuttle\u2014however, Draay would not allow Ying to leave knowing what he did. Draay told Ying that the Jedi would be requiring his shuttle, and when Ying protested, Draay quickly slew the Twi'lek gangster with his lightsaber. In the end, Carrick was able to escape his predicament with the help of Hierogryph and the two Offshoots, who came back to save him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A large, imposing blue-skinned, four-fingered Rutian Twi'lek male with lekku covered in rings, Ying was regarded by his acquaintance Marn Hierogryph as an easily confused dimwit. Although not usually a bounty hunter, he joined the hunt for Hierogryph and Zayne Carrick when it became profitable, but was willing to negotiate with his captives once he found them in the Taris asteroid belt. Ying was also willing to lie, even to a group of Jedi Masters, to uphold his end of a bargain. As a bounty hunter, Ying did not particularly care whether Carrick had actually committed the crime he was accused of, doing the job for the money. However, he was extremely surprised and disturbed when he learned the truth behind the Padawan Massacre, and sought to extricate himself from the situation as quickly as possible."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Valius Ying made his first two appearances in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic: Commencement Part 5 and Part 6, written by John Jackson Miller and released in 2006. For Ying's design, Miller suggested to artists Brian Ching and Travel Foreman that they create an \"alien Tony Soprano\" who started out full of himself but later found himself in over his head. Miller also noted that Ying was the first \"on-screen\" character death in the Knights of the Old Republic comic series. Ying also made a brief flashback appearance in the later installment Knights of the Old Republic: War 4, released in 2012. Over the course of his three Knights of the Old Republic appearances, Ying was illustrated by three different artists\u2014Travel Foreman, Brian Ching, and Andrea Mutti. In 2008, Ying was given an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
