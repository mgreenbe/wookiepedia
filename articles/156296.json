The outpost was constructed during 19 BBY, the final year of the Clone Wars, a galactic event that had been ravaging the galaxy since 22 BBY. The outpost was created by the armies of the Confederacy of Independent Systems as a part of the Outer Rim Sieges. The Galactic Republic, however, discovered the outpost and sent their own army after the outpost, in the form of a battalion of clone troopers. Whatever combat that ensued was broken up, however, by the appearance of a massive beast that destroyed all of the Confederate droid forces, sans one battle droid, and killed the clone troopers. When the clone troopers failed to report back, the Republic sent Jedi Knight Aayla Secura to investigate. She learned of the events from the surviving battle droid and the local Ewoks, and with the battle droid, she went off to destroy the beast. The battle droid as destroyed during the fight with the beast, but Secura nevertheless managed to kill the beast. The Ewoks immortalized Secura, the droid, and the beast in a painting. The outpost was then abandoned completely."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The outpost first appeared in What Goes Up..., a short comic collected in Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures Volume 5 and written and illustrated by the Fillbach Brothers.
