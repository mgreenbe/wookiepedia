The droid consisted of a silver sphere with a lit container of beverage attached beneath and two arms with the dispenser built in. It had at least four sensors, which could glow blue or green. One such droid worked at the establishment known as the Lodge on the planet Vandor. In 10 BBY, the droid served a blue drink to the gambler Lando Calrissian as he sat at a table in the Lodge's back room playing sabacc.
