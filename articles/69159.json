However, the Galactic Republic could not afford the loss of the naval supply depot there, where they proceeded to lay siege to the planet, and throughout the Clone Wars, Coorsa had led a resistance against the Republic, and became known as the \"Phantom of Gall\" for his ability to plan complex operations that depended on correctly guessing how the enemy would respond."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the end of the Clone Wars, Coorsa continued his resistance after Sheev Palpatine's proclamation of the Republic into the Galactic Empire. However, the Empire managed to discover the identity of the Phantom of Gall and proceeded to launch an orbital bombardment on his village, and he, at the recommendations of his rival Lira Hardin, patrician of the Hardin family, left his homeworld alongside his grandson, Kal Coorsa, and the remnants of their clan to the Outer Rim world of Xorrn."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Xorrn, Coorsa and Hardin reactivated the Geonosian-built droid factories of Foundry Four left abandoned after the Clone Wars, and eventually established an orbital repair yard above the planet, where he became the leader of the facility's governing body, Clan Assembly.
