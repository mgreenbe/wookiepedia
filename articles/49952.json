Each FTS was comprised of eight transports, usually Evakmar-KDY transports, with each transport accompanied by two escort frigates. Each transport contained technical and mechanical specialists organized by ship. FTS personnel were called in if a system needed to be replaced, or significant modifications had to be made. FTS could not repair dead ships, but could service them and transport them to deepdock fleets. If the vessel was beyond repair, FTS could salvage the ship's components as necessary."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
