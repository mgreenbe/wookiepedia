Standard combat drivers were trained to handle everything in the Imperial ground arsenal, including 614-AvA speeder bikes, Imperial Troop Transports, and various type of walkers like the All Terrain Defense Pod. They also flew Imperial LAAT/le patrol gunships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several assault vehicles used by the Empire boasted a specialized corps of drivers. Such corps included AT-AT pilots driving All Terrain Armored Transports, tank operators piloting TX-225 GAVw \"Occupier\" combat assault tanks, AT-ST drivers operating All Terrain Scout Transports, and Juggernaut Pilots operating Imperial Combat Assault Transports. However, members of all corps were qualified to operate All Terrain Armored Cargo Transports, since they were not technically designated battlefield assault vehicles. Despite this, they still had a specialized driver group. AT-AT pilots saw themselves as the elite among the elite."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Uniforms"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The generic armor worn by the Empire's combat drivers consisted of a jumpsuit, a cuirass, shoulder- and lower leg-armor, gauntlet-style gloves, and a domed helmet whose faceplate resembled that of Imperial cadets. That combat uniform gave the combat drivers an imposing countenance, and came in two different color schemes. The one worn by the Troop Transports drivers featured a black jumpsuit and field grey armor parts and helmet, while the one worn by AT-DP and speeder bike drivers had a light grey jumpsuit, field grey body armor, and a light grey helmet. In combat, they used an E-11 blaster rifle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
