Because of their appearance, they were frequently mistaken for pests. At the time of the Galactic Civil War, a Wol Cabasshite named Ghoel resided in the palace of Jabba Desilijic Tiure, glued to the walls and arches. The mollusk-like being possessed a prehensile tongue as long as his body, which he used to lick courtiers. He was present when C-3PO and R2-D2 arrived to deliver a message from Luke Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
