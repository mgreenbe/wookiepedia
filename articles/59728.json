The city was built up around a collection of spires that reached up to over four kilometers in height, and the spires themselves, with foundations sunk deep in bedrock, served as an anchor for a skyhook that connected Harnaidan to High Port Space Center in orbit above the planet. These massive structures were also the exclusive domain of the Banking Clan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Beneath the surface of Harnaidan laid a series of underground lakes heated by deep magma vents. The city's commoners descended into the rich waters to harvest mollusks and algae. Surrounding Harnaidan were volcanic spires. The metropolis itself was composed of gleaming marble edifices constructed in the Neo-Classical style and was home to over fifty million Muuns. The layout of the city was orderly, in contrast to urban areas on Denon and Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Separatist stronghold"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a CIS Shadowfeed report from Harnaidan indicated that the ability of the InterGalactic Banking Clan to operate within Republic financial circles, due to their mandated non-exclusivity, had bolstered the value of the CIS credit.

Just prior to engaging the Separatist Droid Army outside the city, Kenobi dispatched The Muunilinst 10 to infiltrate the city in their gunship. Though their gunship was shot down, the elite group managed to fight their way through the streets to the massive defense cannon protecting Harnaidan and destroy it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the cannon out of commission, the Republic bombarded Harnaidan extensively using Self-Propelled Heavy Artillery, with entire city-blocks reduced to rubble. To repel the enemy's advancement, IG lancer combat droids led by Gen'Dai mercenary Durge engaged the Republic, destroying many All Terrain Tactical Enforcer walkers and heavy artillery. Clone lancer troopers led by Kenobi were deployed to stop Durge's forces, with Kenobi seemingly defeated Durge in a duel. The Jedi then rendevouzed with the Muunilinst 10 and captured the Separatist command center, though not before a regenerated Durge attacked the clones; however, the mercenary was once again defeated when Kenobi used the Force from inside Durge's body, causing him to explode."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The forces in the city were soon surprised to see Anakin Skywalker in his starfighter chasing Asajj Ventress in hers.
