This specimen was later killed by said Tusken Raiders and citizens, with the aid of Din Djarin and Cobb Vanth, though it had, in turn, sprayed and killed many of its assailants with its acid.

In 1995, Dr. David West Reynolds, archeologist and contributor to the magazine Star Wars Insider, visted the Tunisian location and found the bones untouched for almost two decades with paleontologist Dr. Micheal J.
