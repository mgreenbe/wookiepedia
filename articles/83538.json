The cruiser was outfitted with numerous systems, including heat baffling, ablative plating, and double-sealed engines that recycled most of its exhaust signature into the life-support and weapons systems which allowed the cruiser to remain virtually invisible from scanners."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship was designed for hit-and-run attacks, and thus was lightly-armored, lightly-shielded, and had little laser weaponry. This put the vessel at a disadvantage in a straight-up fight and Dee was concerned that even a Longbeam and a Jedi Vector would be capable of taking out her flagship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
