A shadowy figure of unknown origins, the Dark Underlord was a male Sith warlord who rose to leadership over the revived Sith Empire, establishing an alliance known as the Black Knights. Based on the planet Malrev IV, the Underlord led a bloody campaign against the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order, terrorizing the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories. These activities provoked the ire of Murrtaggh, a Jedi Master who\u2014aided by Mandalorian mercenaries\u2014misdirected the Black Knights in a surprise attack against the Underlord's base of operations.

During this time, the origins of the Dark Underlord remained an enigma, his true nature shrouded behind a cloud of speculation and Sith folklore. One popular theory tied his emergence to the actions of a lone Sith Acolyte, who allegedly summoned the Underlord from the dark, netherworldly realm of Chaos. Another rumor claimed that the Dark Underlord was none other than the reincarnated ghost of Xendor, a powerful darksider who\u2014thousands of years earlier\u2014fought during the First Great Schism of the peacekeeping Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite his shadowy presence, the Dark Underlord rose to prominence in around 1750 BBY, becoming a new leader of the resurgent Sith Empire in a crusade against the Galactic Republic and its Jedi protectors. Having seized the coveted mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith, he garnered infamy as a particularly bloodthirsty marauder, swathing through the frontline of battle and proving more than a match for the Jedi. Standing among the most powerful Sith of his time, the Dark Underlord organized his followers into a Sith alliance called the Black Knights, forming a base of operations on the planet Malrev IV. Commanding his Black Knights, the Dark Underlord led an incursion into the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories, terrorizing numerous space stations along the Zona Miki hyperspace route."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Reviled as a scourge of the Jedi and the Republic, the Dark Underlord and his minions soon provoked the intervention of Murrtaggh, a Jedi Master who had been plotting retaliation against the Dark Lord of the Sith. Unbeknownst to the Underlord, Murrtaggh enlisted a group of Mandalorian mercenaries for a planned surprise attack against the Sith headquarters on Malrev IV. Unwittingly ensnared by Master Murrtaggh's diversionary attack, the Dark Underlord dispatched his Black Knights\u2014commanded by the Sith Lord's leading general\u2014to eliminate the invading Mandalorian forces. This decision left the Underlord vulnerable, however, and allowed the Jedi Master to infiltrate Sith territory, resulting in a confrontation between the pair. Despite his power and deadly reputation, the Underlord met his match and fell at the hands of Murrtaggh, promptly ending the Dark Lord's reign."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The death of the Dark Underlord had an immediate impact on Jedi Master Murrtaggh, who fell to the dark side upon slaying the Dark Lord of the Sith. Despite the Underlord's demise, the Sith crusades not only remained undeterred, but grew more dominant over the following centuries of the New Sith Wars. Additionally, the Black Knights\u2014although defeated\u2014reformed their numbers on several occasions in the absence of their fallen master. Even following the eventual Sith defeat at the conclusion of the New Sith Wars, the Black Knights remained active during a conflict known as the Fluwhaka revolt. Sometime after 990 BBY, the exploits of the Dark Underlord were briefly detailed in The Jedi Path, a guidebook intended for Jedi Initiates."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An emotionless dark side spirit, the Dark Underlord was an enigmatic figure during the New Sith Wars, leading to much speculation regarding his true nature and origins. Nonetheless, his reign as the Dark Lord was characterized by a penchant for carnage and plunder.
