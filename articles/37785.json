Located in the Zi-Kree Sector of the Crimson Corridor, it was rather disreputable. Neimoidians frequented it because it was one of the few places on Coruscant that served agaric ale. It did not allow droids. It was from this cantina that Darth Maul tracked Hath Monchar, a Neimoidian who betrayed Darth Sidious prior to the blockade over Naboo. Monchar had arranged, at the inn, to sell information about the blockade to Lorn Pavan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
