The building was named after a former Emperor of the Tapani sector, Leocald VII, who was considered the patron saint of Tapani opera. Performers working in the building had access to three theatres, a large number of rehearsal halls, a dance academy and apartments for those in residence. During peak time in Capital Season, the House would often have two to three different shows running at the same time, with less on during the rest of the year."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Opera House was first mentioned in the campaign guide included in Lords of the Expanse, a 1997 supplement written by Paul Sudlow and Chris Doyle for Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game by West End Games."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
