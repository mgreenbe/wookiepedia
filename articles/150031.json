Before his death, Tulak Hord hid the artifact in a cave on Balmorra. The cave was centuries later used by the Galactic Republic to construct the Hazard Vault 305 for safe-keeping hazardous chemicals. During the Battle of Balmorra the vault was damaged and the chemicals spilled inside. In 3643 BBY the apprentice of Darth Zash recovered the arifact from the vault, and Zash later combined it with four other artifacts to perform the Transfer essence ritual in the Dark Temple on Dromund Kaas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tulak Hord's artifact on Balmorra appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic during the Sith Inquisitor class mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
