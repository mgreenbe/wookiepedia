Gecee's ineptitude usually meant that Nabon beat him to the good jobs, a fact that rankled the Gran. Both Nabon and Gecee were involved in a barroom brawl at the Black Dust Tavern, on Socorro, shortly after the Battle of Endor. After Nabon knocked him unconscious, Gecee attacked Fen when she returned to the Star Lady. Gecee would have shot Nabon if Ghitsa Dogder hadn't grabbed his ear and immobilized him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
