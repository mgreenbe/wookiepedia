As of 44 BBY, the planet was controlled by the Syndicat, and Laressa took the brunt of the blow. Under the Syndicat, the main marketplace barely carried enough supplies to maintain the health of the people. Furthermore, the Syndicat's headquarters was located in Laressa, making the criminal-level security of the capital considerably higher than the rest of the planet. Through the efforts of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn, Paxxi Derida and Guerra Derida, the Syndicat was overthrown that year."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
