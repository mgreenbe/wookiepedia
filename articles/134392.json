George Snow was visual supervisor for all eighteen issues."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Its main feature was a large full-color poster (advertised as \"a giant, nearly 2 foot by 3 foot poster\") of a character or scene from the original Star Wars film. However, it is perhaps more notable today, especially to fans of the Expanded Universe or those with an interest in the technical aspects of filmmaking, for the short illustrated articles included. These articles included character profiles, interviews with special effects crew and artists, vignettes about the Star Wars universe, and even discussions about real-world scientific topics relating to the film. The in-universe articles are particularly interesting for identifying the Imperial stormtroopers as clones, and discussing Darth Vader's reconstruction as a cyborg after losing a duel near a volcanic pit to Obi-Wan Kenobi, long before the release of the Prequel trilogy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars Official Poster Monthly was followed up by five issues of The Empire Strikes Back Official Poster Monthly in 1980, and four issues of Return of the Jedi Official Poster Monthly in 1983."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Scans of the articles (though not the posters themselves) are available in the \"Arcana Historica\" section of Time Tales on TheForce.net."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Issues"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}]}
