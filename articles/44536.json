Its sensors included a motion sensor, comm scanner, metal scanner, and life-form scanners, and the unit was small enough to be carried around the neck. The EnhanceScan could detect life forms 1,500 meters away, the comm scanner had an effective range of three kilometers, the motion sensor had a 500 meter range, but the metal scanner only had a maximum range of one hundred meters. The computer built into the scanner controlled all four sensors and displayed the data on a readout screen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Components of the EnhanceScan general-purpose scanner included an antenna, motion sensor, metal scanner, comm scanner, power cells, data port, power indicator, and life-form scanner."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
