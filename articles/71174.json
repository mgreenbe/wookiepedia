Wielding a lightsaber in battle, Durael crafted his weapon using a dragite crystal. During the Clone Wars, Durael took up the rank of general within the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic. Near the end of the war, Durael was assigned to lead the invasion of the Cato Neimoidian city of Jorra alongside fellow Knights Suljo Warde and Kaddo Moll. After a successful invasion of the city, Durael and his colleagues remained behind to fortify the Republic's position. As the Jedi and Republic forces occupied the city, many of the Neimoidian residents resented the Jedi, something that began to eat away at Jedi Warde."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As his colleague began to grow more and more anxious, Durael watched with caution and concern as Jedi Warde began arresting civilians on the grounds that they would aid the Confederacy war effort in the future; something he knew due to his precognitive skills. Trying his best to intervene on behalf of the public good and their mandate from the High Council on Coruscant, Durael could not prevent butting heads with Warde, and he eventually grew to distrust the Twi'lek. The tipping point for Warde came when a delegation of Trade federation officers and CIS diplomats arrived in Jorra to negotiate a ceasefire. Durael accompanied Warde and Moll to Sankar Palace where the talks were to be held, but was discouraged when Warde warned of a vision in which the ceasefire was a ploy to end the Republic occupation. Fearing the repercussions of acting prematurely to one of Warde's visions, Moll and Durael insisted that the negotiations proceed uninterrupted. As the negotiations began, Warde unleashed his rage on the assembled delegates and slew the Neimoidians where they stood. Appalled, Moll and Durael drew their lightsabers and declared their intention to arrest their wayward brother. Dueling through the halls of the Palace, Warde cornered Durael on a balcony overlooking the ruined audience chamber. After Warde sliced Durael's lightsaber in half, the Twi'lek was helpless to prevent being impaled through the chest on Warde's weapon. Collapsing onto Warde, Durael snatched away one of the kyber crystals that Warde kept on him, before falling to the ground. As the fighting continued away from the balcony, Durael slumped against the balcony railing and died."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moll and Durael's bodies were never recovered by the Order, as the Jedi were all but destroyed with the rise of the Galactic Empire. Over two decades after his death, Durael's body was disturbed by explorers who sought out the kyber crystal that Durael had stolen in his final moments. Reduced to a skeleton dressed in tattered Jedi robes, Durael's bones gave up the kyber crystal as well as the dragite crystal that Durael had once used to power his lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
