By the year 19 BBY, the hunting lodge had been left abandoned for some time; a layer of dust caked the top of lodge's rough table and other flat surfaces, and a number of dead insects could be found laying on the window sills. That same year, not long after the Galactic Empire rose to power and moved to establish an Imperial garrison on Mandalore, reigning Mand'alor Fenn Shysa met with Mandalorian soldier Kal Skirata at the abandoned lodge to discuss issues concerning the future of Mandalore in the wake of the Empire's presence. The two talked over drinks, and while Skirata was unable to help Shysa, they both parted amicably."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The hunting lodge in Olankur first appeared in Star Wars canon in the 2009 novel, Imperial Commando: 501st by author Karen Traviss."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
