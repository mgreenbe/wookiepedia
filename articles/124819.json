It had a balcony which overlooked a courtyard. In 21 BBY, the castle was taken over by Shon-Ju and his three students. They were pursuing the mercenary Attuma Duum to stop his operations. After rescuing the Jedi Knight Aayla Secura, the students brought her back to the castle so she could recover from her injuries. When she woke up, she sought out Shon-Ju and the two agreed to join forces. The next morning, they took two of Duum's abandoned bombers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This castle appears in the 2010 graphic novella The Clone Wars: Deadly Hands of Shon-Ju"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
