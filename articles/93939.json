He was notable for constructing the StarForge Station, a shadowport deep in the StarForge Nebula in Ado sector, that was intended to be his base of operations. He saved the cost by building the station on existing planetoid, and using mostly junked starships remained from the battles fought within the nebula. However, soon after its completion, Glandish was killed. The station administration fell first to his friends, and later to a council of tenants who voted on the administrator, who deals with the day-to-day operations of the station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
