The two began to battle in the Stygian Caldera nebula, but their conflict soon disrupted Imperial trade, prompting a negotiator to convince them to move their battle elsewhere in the Outer Rim Territories."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He would later rise to the position of Darth during the intervening years, and would sit on the Dark Council by 3628 BBY, as Head of Sith Doctrine - a newly created seat that oversaw the former Spheres of Mysteries, Sith Philosophy & Ancient Knowledge.

In response, Anathel refuted that the Sith Inquisitor is neither a member of the Dark Council or of the Empire and thus had no grounds to challenge him. He later sends an email to the player character, declaring his rival too feeble compared to him. Following the Meridian Complex assault, as the Dark Council assembled on Vaiken Spacedock in person, the player character proceeds to kill Anathel and has the option to rejoin the Empire as a Dark Councillor, taking his seat. Alternatively, if the player does not challenge Anathel during the Onslaught prologue, his life will be spared at the end of base game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
