The subsequent Emergences of the starship's debris caused widespread disruptions to hyperspace travel, as it was difficult to predict where further debris would appear. The Nihil, an Outer Rim pirate group with unusual means of hyperspace travel, took advantage of the chaos. Eventually, Trymant IV was threatened by one Emergence, which was reported to the Galactic Republic by the crew of Republic Security Zone Monitoring Satellite 777B-Alpha, in orbit around the planet. The closest ship available to respond was the Star Hopper, a Padawan Academic Cruiser in service to the Jedi Order which was carrying a class of Padawans under the supervision of Jedi Grand Master Yoda and Jedi Master Torban Buck, and it immediately diverted to help."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many of the pieces of debris threatened Bralanak City.
