The Quarren of nearby Dac staked claims to Pammant and other worlds located in the sector, using them as bases for starship construction. During the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Pammant shipyards were used by the Quarren-dominated Free Dac Volunteers Engineering Corps to produce Separatist warships such as the Malevolence and the Invisible Hand, both used as flagships by the Separatist General Grievous. However, before the Battle of Coruscant in 19 BBY, Pammant was devastated when the Republic Praetor-class Star Battlecruiser Quaestor suffered a hyperspace accident and collided with the planet, fracturing Pammant and dousing it with radiation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tunneled planet Pammant was located in the Pammant system in the Calamari sector of the Outer Rim Territories. It was situated on the Overic Griplink hyperlane, which connected Pammant to two nearby planets\u2014Dac in the galactic northwest and Mantan in the galactic south. Though originally an uninhabited world, Pammant was one of several planets in the Calamari sector claimed by the aquatic Quarren, who used their new worlds as locations for starship construction yards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point before 4166 BBY, the uninhabited world of Pammant was one of many planets, including Minntooine and Buchich, claimed by the Quarren in the Calamari sector. The Quarren used their new acquisitions as locations for shipyards. By the time of the Clone Wars thousands of years later, Pammant housed both a Quarren colony and the Pammant Docks, a factory located in the underground tunnels of the world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Clone Wars erupted between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems in 22 BBY, the Quarren Isolation League formed and allied itself with the Confederacy, causing the Quarren-dominated worlds in the Calamari sector to follow suit. On both Pammant and Minntooine, the Quarren of the Free Dac Volunteers Engineering Corps produced a variety of warships for use in the Confederate Navy. Pammant's docks became highly valued by the Confederacy. The shipyards produced Providence-class carrier/destroyers such as the Invisible Hand, the Colicoid Swarm, and the Lucid Voice, each of which was used by the Separatist Supreme Commander, General Grievous, to spread fear throughout the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Additionally, the Subjugator-class heavy cruiser line was designed and manufactured on Pammant, a fact shrouded in secrecy by the Quarren Separatists, who used the construction of the Providence-class carrier/destroyers as their cover. During the construction of the heavy cruiser Malevolence, Republic spies watching Pammant observed the immense drydock in which the warship was being constructed. When the ship was finally launched, the operatives were captured before they could report their sighting of the massive ship to the Republic government on Coruscant. A few weeks later, the Malevolence's sister ship, the Devastation, was launched from Pammant. Following the Malevolence's destruction, Clone Captain Lock led a clone trooper team to search through the cruiser's debris. They found evidence that the warship had been constructed by the Free Dac Volunteers Engineering Corps at Pammant, confirming beliefs held by Republic Intelligence. The Confederacy also investigated the Malevolence's crash site, but for a different purpose, retrieving intelligence for use in the construction of a new Malevolence at Pammant. Grievous personally oversaw the effort, journeying to Pammant alongside Separatist leader Count Dooku. They were pursued by a Jedi Knight, who engaged them in a duel on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Just before the Battle of Coruscant in 19 BBY, the Republic Praetor-class Star Battlecruiser Quaestor led a Republic attack on Pammant. During the battle, torpedo droids damaged the battlecruiser's hyperdrive, causing the ship to jump to hyperspace and collide with the planet. The cataclysm destroyed the Quaestor and devastated Pammant, which was fractured to the core and doused with radiation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though originally uninhabited, Pammant was claimed by the Quarren, who established a colony on the planet.

Since then, the world has appeared in additional sources, each of which contributed minor details to Pammant's history. Star Wars: The Clone Wars: The Visual Guide, published in 2008, established Pammant as the origin of the Malevolence from The Clone Wars TV series, and 2009's The Essential Atlas provided both the galactic location for Pammant and a brief history of the world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
