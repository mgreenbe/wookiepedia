At some point during the Galactic Civil War, Vordell and his crew were captured by the Imperial Customs corvette Auditor and to buy their freedom, Vordell made a deal to help the Imperials recover a missing cargo of blaster rifles. The Auditor traveled to the moon Phinel's Folly, where a group of freelance agents were transporting the rifles to, and Vordell, Kollu and Trom, another member of the Opportunity's crew, were sent to the moon's surface, to rendezvous with the agents. A group of stormtroopers then ambushed the agents, while Vordell, Kollu and Trom tried to take cover in a nearby cave."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
