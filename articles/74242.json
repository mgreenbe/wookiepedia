During the Clone Wars, a Star Destroyer crashed at the mouth of the valley and was buried deep within the fertile earth. As acres of forests burned around the crash site, an army of clone troopers burned the villages of the valley as they moved out towards Vossport. The armies of Vossport met the troopers at the mouth of the valley, and while they were far outmatched by the clones, were eventually victorious when a group of Force-sensitives cut down the troopers with their ancient sunfire swords."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
