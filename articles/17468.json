It was headed by Dequc, a low-level Jeodu operative of Black Sun who styled himself \"Prince\" after Xizor's death. Black Nebula's headquarters were in the Bubble Cliffs on the planet Qiaxx, and many Jeodu joined the organization. Black Nebula also drew in several remnant cells of Black Sun. The organization dissolved in 4.5 ABY when Mara Jade, as her final assignment for the late Emperor, killed Dequc and other high-level leaders and destroyed the Black Nebula headquarters, before leaving behind a cache of information on them for Imperial officials that was sufficient to mop up the rest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
