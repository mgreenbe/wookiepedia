From this black market network came a group of Moogan smugglers, who illegally imported cases of Ardees Beverage tea to Sundari; these smugglers wished to maximize their profits and thus used the chemical slabin to dilute the tea. However, the Moogans added too high of a slabin concentration to the tea, making it toxic for an unwary consumer. Distributed to Sundari's schools, the slabin-laced tea soon had hundreds of New Mandalorian school children being taken to Doctor Zaz's hospital seeking treatment for severe stomach pain as a result of the slabin overdosing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zaz, seeking an answer to the question of what had caused these children's sudden illness, investigated both the food and drinks served at the children's school but found nothing out of the ordinary. However, the New Mandalorian leader, Duchess Satine Kryze, and the visiting Republic senator, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, acquired a bottle of the affected tea for Zaz to test; his test revealed the presence of the high slabin concentrations, leading the two politicians on their way toward putting an end to the Moogan smuggling ring. Kryze and Amidala also acquired antidotes for the slabin poisoning, which Zaz and the hospital staff administered to the sick children."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zak Zaz made his first appearance in Star Wars in the 2010 Star Wars: The Clone Wars television episode, \"Corruption\", part of the series' third season and during which he was voiced by Corey Burton.
