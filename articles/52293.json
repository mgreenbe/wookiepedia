Galin was delivering bacta to the Rebellion on Hoth when the Imperials began their attack on the planet. As the ship attempted to leave the planet in the midst of the Battle of Hoth, it collided with a TIE fighter, damaging the ship's coolant systems. Tomaas suggested going to the Twin Sun Station for repairs, however, Galin reminded Tomaas that Antan Azzameen was there. Galin suggested that Antan would not give repairs in order to stay out of entangling with the Rebellion. Tomaas insisted, but when they arrived, Galin was proven correct when Antan refused to provide repairs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He also sent an E-mail to his youngest brother Ace, and no one else, suggesting him that the family should stay alert and keep an eye out for each other, maybe even fly in pairs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He was also a crewmember of the GR-75 medium transport Vasudra when he was acquiring bacta from the Loose Cannon pirates and when the pirates double crossed them Galin and Tomaas managed to sort out what was going on when the pirates were driven away by the Azzameens.
