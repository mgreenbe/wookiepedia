A group of old-fashioned smugglers worked here, helping to maintain a low profile for the clientele. Both the Pulsar Skate and the Love Commander docked there after the assassination attempt on Wedge Antilles as the members of those ships' crews were trying to avoid CorSec attention. Both ships and the X-wings of Wedge Antilles and Corran Horn ended up blasting out of the spaceport once their cover had been blown."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
