After Han Solo's near-destruction of the spice facility on Ylesia and Zavval's death, Kibbick was sent as a replacement Hutt overlord to watch over Teroenza, a position he loathed. Teroenza proved far more clever and intelligent than Kibbick and managed the entire operation without Kibbick's input. Kibbick was regarded by the t'landa Til and most Hutts as an idiot. Kibbick had difficulty understanding the goings-on of Ylesia and was not even aware that it was Teroenza who truly governed Ylesia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kibbick's stupidity would lead to his gruesome death.
