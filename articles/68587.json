The establishment boasted a long transparisteel window that allowed patrons to look out, however, outsiders could not see in. This feature made the cantina a good location to spy on someone. The Jaded Jawa was known as a hotspot for illegal drugs and was never very busy. The food was poor and the drinks were unimaginative. The main reason that people visited the bar was for information. Dakkar owned this locale at the height of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
