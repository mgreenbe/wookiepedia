In 22 BBY, the Invincible served as the command ship of the Confederacy's blockade of the planet Christophsis, where it and the blockade were contested by a Galactic Republic task force led by Jedi General Anakin Skywalker. However, the Republic was unsuccessful in their attack and were forced to retreat from the battle zone at the behest of Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi, who arrived at the battle aboard his flagship, therefore giving Trench and the Invincible the first victory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not long after, the Invincible was assaulted once more by Skywalker, who was using a prototype stealth ship against it. As a result, Skywalker managed to destroy the dreadnought after a lengthy battle between the two ships, which caused the Invincible's tracking torpedoes to destroy its bridge and therefore the vessel as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, during the time of the Galactic Empire, the modules that belonged to the Invincible were salvaged by Imperial defector Berch Teller. Teller then used the destroyed dreadnought's modules to modify a former Separatist dreadnought, which he used to the Empire's Sentinel Base five years after the government's beginning."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Invincible was a 2,177.35 meter-long Providence-class Dreadnought that was crewed by B1-series battle droids and was equipped with three Creveld-4 radial ion drives, as well as a port hangar bay, which carried a complement of ten Hyena-class Droid Bombers. The dreadnought was also armed with fourteen heavy quad turbolaser cannons, thirty-four dual heavy laser cannons, and two forward-mounted heavy ion cannons. The Invincible was additionally armed with twelve point-defense ion cannons, twelve heavy flak cannons, and 102 proton torpedo launchers which could fire tracking torpedoes. However, in order for the dreadnought to fire its tracking torpedoes, the vessel was required to deactivate its shields, which left it vulernable to an attack until the shields were fully recharged."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Invincible also came equipped with recyclable thermal shields, which were capable of withstanding heavy fire from the DBY-827 heavy turbolaser turrets of Venator-class Star Destroyers, as well as the proton torpedoes of an IPV-2C Stealth Corvette, and was additionally equipped with a communications device that could be patched into an open frequency. The dreadnought was also capable of tracking the magnetic signature of other starships, including models with cloaking devices. The bow of the ship was painted with blue markings that mimicked its commander's, the Harch Separatist Admiral Trench, eyes, and both its port and starboard sides of the hull were adorned with Trench's personal symbol instead of the emblem of the Confederacy of Independent Systems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Repelling the Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems, the planet Christophsis was invaded by the Separatist Droid Army as a result of its resources and strategic position along the Corellian Run hyperspace route. After managing to occupy the planet's surface, the Confederacy established a thirty-craft blockade of at least twenty-three Munificent-class star frigates and six Lucrehulk-class Battleships, which was placed under the command of Harch Separatist Admiral Trench aboard his flagship Invincible, the command ship of the blockade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following its establishment, the Invincible and the rest of the blockade was attacked by a Republic task force commanded by Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, who were sent to breach the blockade and deliver relief supplies to the trapped Republic Senator Bail Organa on the surface. After the Republic's arrival, the Invincible and the other Separatist warships began to exchange turbolaser fire with Skywalker's fleet of three Venator-class Star Destroyers and three Pelta-class frigates. As both fleets fired upon one another, the Invincible began to advance unopposed on the Republic fleet, and proceeded to open fire on all opposing warships, destroying one of the Republic's supply ships. Continuing its barrage, Skywalker ordered his fleet to over-fire their reactors in order to charge directly through the blockade, which prompted Trench to order the Invincible and his fleet to maintain their position and intensify their forward deflector shields."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the Republic fleet was prevented with following through with their plan after Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had arrived in the Christoph system aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Negotiator, ordered them to withdraw from the battle to behind Christophsis' moon, which prompted the Invincible and the rest of the blockade to end their attack. While the Republic fled, Trench's T-series tactical droid TI-99 inquired as to whether or not they should, to which the Harch explained that their orders were to hold a blockade and not to chase, and that the Republic would return. Shortly thereafter, Trench ordered the Invincible's bridge crew to recharge the dreadnought's shields and to allow their cannons to reset while the Republic restrategized."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Baiting the Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Republic recuperated, Trench, aboard the Invincible ordered TI-99 to provide an update on the surface engagements. The droid stated that the resistance from the inhabitants was crumbling and that the Confederacy was expected to have full control in a half planetary rotation. In response, the Harch sent a squadron of ten Hyena-class Droid Bombers from the Invincible's port hangar to bomb the surface, believing that a two-pronged assault would draw out the Republic fleet. Unknowingly flying directly over Skywalker, who was ordered by Kenobi to use a prototype stealth ship to continue their supply run, the bombers succeeded in their mission and prompted Senator Organa to contact the Republic fleet of the situation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a result of the bombing run, the Invincible was once again attacked by Skywalker aboard the stealth ship. Skywalker then revealed himself to Trench and the dreadnought by deactivating the ship's cloaking device, and proceeded to fire several proton torpedoes at the Invincible's command bridge, which were repelled by the Providence's thermal shields."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In response, Trench ordered the crew of his dreadnought to fire four tracking torpedoes at the Republic craft, which were unsuccessful as they hit flares dispersed from the stealth, prompting the Invincible to  fire a wall of lasers in the direction of the once-again cloaked ship, but the Invincible's scanners indicated that they were unsuccessful in hitting Skywalker. However, despite being successful, Trench came to realize that a clone trooper would not have been able to navigate a barrage of lasers with such ease, and that they were instead opposed by a Jedi."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Fight with a Jedi and destruction"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly thereafter, Trench once again ordered the Invincible's crew to patch him into the communications channel on an open frequency to relay a message to their attackers.

Affirming the Harch's hypothesis, Skywalker once again disengaged the cloaking device and fired four more torpedoes at the Invincible's port hull, but were once more repelled by the dreadnought's shields. Amid re-engaging the cloaking device, the Providence was able to lock onto the stealth ship's magnetic signature before it could disappear."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon acquiring its magnetic signature, the Invincible attempted to fire more tracking torpedoes towards Skywalker's ship, but was forced to deactivate their shields in order to do so. Lowering its shields, the dreadnought proceeded to fire its torpedoes, which prompted Skywalker to disengage the cloaking device once more and divert all power to their engines, advancing directly toward the unshielded Invincible and sending the torpedoes into its bridge, destroying the dreadnought as a result. Following the Invincible's destruction, the Republic fleet returned and continued their attack on the rest of the blockade, which had been thrown into disarray as a result of the command ship's destruction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Invincible made its debut in \"Cat and Mouse,\" the sixteenth episode of the second season of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series, which aired on March 26, 2010.
