He was one of the mysterious advisers of the Noble Court, the original rulers of the Anoat sector. Throughout the ages, men and women like Xiath helped the nobles maintain their independence under the Galactic Republic and survive the purges of the Galactic Empire. Xiath trained several acolytes, including a Nothoiin named Amrosio. At some point during the Imperial blockade of the Anoat sector, a young smuggler from Burnin Konn visited Xiath in his lair, the Ancient Palace on Hosra. Sensing the Force-sensitivity of his visitor, Xiath offered to train the smuggler."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mentor Xiath first appeared in the 2015 mobile game Star Wars: Uprising, in which he was voiced by Ike Amadi.
