Grievous was originally a Kaleesh from the planet Kalee, where he lived his early life. During the Kaleesh conflict against the Huk, Qymaen jai Sheelal quickly learned the art of war, specializing in a slugthrower rifle. Quickly amassing a great number of Huk kills, he became a demigod among his people. He eventually met the female Kaleesh Ronderu lij Kummar, a master with the sword. The two became very close before Kummar's death at the hands of the Huk. Heartbroken, Qymaen jai Sheelal renamed himself Grievous and turned all his anger and grief toward the Huk. Aided by his elite, he forced the Huk off Kalee and then swarmed their homeworld, conquering them. The Huk turned to the Galactic Republic for help, and the Kaleesh were forced back to their own world by the Jedi and left to starve."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Desperate to help his people, Grievous took a job as an enforcer with the InterGalactic Banking Clan. However, after learning that the Huk had attacked Kalee, he headed home to gain vengeance. IGBC Chairman San Hill, after consulting with his ally, Separatist Head of State Count Dooku, arranged for a bomb to be placed on Grievous' shuttle, Martyr. The Kaleesh was critically injured, but lived, and Hill arranged for the final stage of his plan.

Aided by his IG-100 MagnaGuards, Grievous killed many Jedi, and led the Confederacy to victory in many battles. Quickly gaining a reputation as a savage, merciless brute as well as a tactical genius, the cyborg, despite earning the nickname the \"head clanker,\" struck fear into the hearts of many with his flagship, the ion cannon\u2013armed Malevolence, as well as Operation Durge's Lance, a massive strike at the Core Worlds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 BBY, Grievous led the Confederate Navy in the Battle of Coruscant, an attack on the Republic's capital.

Grievous fled to the Outer Rim world of Utapau and attempted to regain control of the war, though the Confederacy had been dealt a great blow with the loss of Dooku. Grievous was killed shortly after in the Battle of Utapau by Kenobi, and the Confederacy fell soon after. At some point after Grievous's death, his body was used to create the droid warrior N-K Necrosis, who considered himself to be the reincarnation of Grievous.

The conflict between the two species was known as the Huk War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sheelal's father, seeking a useful outlet for his son's anger, taught him how to handle a slugthrower rifle. The young Sheelal proved himself an excellent marksman with a mind as finely honed as any weapon; by eight years of age he had already become an expert sniper with more than forty Huk kills to his credit. By the age of twenty-two, he had slain so many Huk that the Kaleesh people considered Sheelal a demigod."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sheelal's closest comrade was a fellow Kaleesh warrior and mercenary Ronderu lij Kummar. According to legend, his relationship with this wild and skilled swordswoman had its beginnings in a dream, in which Sheelal saw himself slaying a wild mumuu in the Kunbal jungle with Lig swords. So taken was he with this vision that he set out in his mumuu hunting mask to kill one in reality, but instead of finding a mumuu in the jungle, he saw Kummar. He realized that the slayer in his dream had not been himself, but the woman standing before him in a karabbac mask and wielding twin Lig swords.

With this realization, Qymaen jai Sheelal cast off his old identity, adopting a name more appropriate to a being destined to grieve forever, and, even more terribly, who was determined that he would not do so alone.

His attacks and mass destruction of entire Huk planets ensured Kaleesh victory until the Huk turned to the Galactic Republic for help.

Grievous felt disgust at the notion of being a glorified leg-breaker for a soulless megacorporation, but he understood what the agreement would mean for his people, and besides, there was something in this innate warrior that needed to keep fighting.

He would have to make do with droids, but, having no confidence in the IGBC's basic battle droids, he demanded more intelligent models to take the place of his elite. With Count Dooku's permission, Hill consented and began production on the IG-100 MagnaGuards. Grievous, at first, was disgusted with the droids because they were completely mindless.

San Hill was far from pleased. He considered ordering Grievous's assassination, but he feared the vengeance the Kaleesh would take if he survived.

The resulting explosion sent the Martyr plunging into the Jenuwaa Sea. Dooku's remote command ejected Grievous from the wreck at the last moment, but all his Izvoshra perished in the crash. His body, hemorrhaging and in shock, was dragged from the water, and Dooku used the arcane Sith heart stun technique to keep him from succumbing to cardiac arrest while en route to Geonosis. It was then that Dooku first planted the idea that the Jedi themselves were responsible for this attack in Grievous' mind. Then, MagnaGuards dragged him to a nearby shuttle, where FX-series medical assistant droids worked to stabilize his condition during the journey.

San Hill repeated his proposal, including a promise to replace Grievous's broken body.

His vital organs were housed in a synthskin gut-sack impervious to vacuum. The Geonosians would also alter his brain against his wishes, both to trim away disturbing memories\u2014while enhancing his rage centers\u2014and to enhance his equilibrium, allowing him to better employ his newfound agility. Internal implants were also placed in his eyes to sharpen his vision and to protect them from the vacuum of space. While the midi-chlorian-rich blood of Sifo-Dyas may have played a critical role in maintaining Sheelal's life, Grievous saw it as a personal failure that the transfusion did not also give him a degree of sensitivity to the Force. To San Hill and his allies, however, the experiment was a phenomenal success. Qymaen jai Sheelal had become General Grievous in form as well as spirit.

He further rebelled by openly displaying his Kaleesh heritage by adorning himself and his MagnaGuards with masks and cloaks in styles closely resembling those found amongst his people, considered by Dooku to be an act of vanity.

The general addressed the trapped Jedi, stating that he would grant them a \"warrior's death\" and lying in wait for them to move. Once Padawan Gi ran screaming into the unprotected open, Grievous jumped on and killed him.

Shaak Ti desperately tried to defend herself but was unable to escape his onslaught. Grievous quickly overwhelmed her, knocking her lightsaber out of her hand and kicked her hard against a pile of debris. A recovered Mundi attempted to retrieve his lightsaber with the Force, only to have Grievous trap the weapon beneath one of his clawed feet and pick it up himself.

Grievous sent his forward armies through a strategic canyon to attack the Republic's main army, where they were ambushed by clone troopers and Barriss Offee, Unduli's Padawan. Though the droids appeared to have defeated the clones, they were only pretending to be dead, and attacked the army from behind when it engaged Unduli's forces at the other end of the canyon.

After eradicating a Republic task force in the Phu system, Grievous and the Malevolence were stationed in the Abregado system with Count Dooku, who had arrived aboard the warship to supervise Grievous's progress. Jedi Master Plo Koon led a task force to find and destroy the Separatist superweapon, and arrived in the system to engage the warship. Before the Jedi could get in firing range, Grievous ordered the Malevolence's battle droid crew to fire an ion blast at the Republic fleet.

During the craft's hunt for life pods, however, the Malevolence lost contact with the pod hunter, and Grievous mused that perhaps some survivors were putting up a fight. As the Malevolence activated its scanners, the battle droid crew picked up a signal from a non-Separatist droid, and Grievous immediately ordered his warship to assume attack position.

Dooku assigned the medical center as the Malevolence's new target, seeking to exploit the weakness that the Jedi displayed in their care for their clone troopers. This assignment boosted Grievous's confidence, as it showed that the Count had not completely lost his faith in him since his recent failure at Abregado. As the remaining Republic frigate deployed several escape pods, Grievous ordered the pods to be targeted, stating that he had \"a reputation to uphold.\" To get to the medical station, the Malevolence's navicomputer was forced to calculate a complex hyperspace course around the Kaliida Nebula, which was near the medcenter.

With the Malevolence's primary weapons disabled, Grievous ordered a full retreat to Separatist space. General Obi-Wan Kenobi then arrived in the system with a fleet of three Venator-class Star Destroyers and began to attack Grievous's ravaged flagship. As the Malevolence fled under increasing fire from the Republic cruisers, Dooku contacted Grievous and informed the general that Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala of the Republic had been tricked into traveling to the nebula; with her as a hostage, Grievous would be able to safely escape.

After his shuttle crash, Grievous was left bitter and felt cheated, having been robbed of a proper warrior's death. When he was offered a chance at continued existence as a cyborg, he took the offer, as he had come to see flesh as weak. However, despite this viewpoint, he remained secretly ashamed of his new robotic body. Though he did not know it, his brain had been tampered with during his reconstruction by the Geonosians, increasing his anger and hatred. After the crash, Grievous also began to compare himself with the Jedi and became determined to equal them. To this end, he constantly submitted himself to improvements to boost himself up to their caliber. Although he initially took Dooku's bestowing of the title \"Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies\" title as a personal insult, Grievous came to highly respect both Dooku and Darth Sidious, considering them the Separatists' only \"necessary\" political leadership."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the battlefield, Grievous was an excellent commander and an ingenious tactician, fighting hard to bring down the Republic. He had no qualms with sacrificing civilians to ensure his own survival and exploited the Jedi's compassion for the clone troopers under their command, exemplified during his attack on the Kaliida Shoals Medical Center. He also showed signs of being sadistic, as he seemed to enjoy killing and torturing his foes. Indeed, he even took pleasure in attacking the planet Dorin and its Republic-loyal citizens, believing that they should suffer the consequences for staying loyal to the Republic. His acts of wanton destruction during the war caused him to become an avatar of terror in the eyes of the Republic populace. However, despite these traits\u2014or rather, because of them\u2014Grievous was arrogant. His hubris eventually led to his death at the hands of Obi-Wan Kenobi. In addition to his arrogance, Grievous was also accused of being cowardly, as he usually fled whenever the tide turned against him. Despite injuries dealt to him over the course of his career, Grievous always insisted on fighting the Jedi personally when possible, displaying a mild form of recklessness as well as restlessness. This was displayed by refusing to heed EV-A4D's advice to recuperate after his first bout with Kit Fisto and Nahdar Vebb, as well as desiring to fight Kenobi alone on Utapau while still in his coughing fits. Grievous also showed almost no compassion to even his own allies, as demonstrated during the Battle of Coruscant, where he smashed the Invisible Hand's Neimoidian senior gunnery officer's face with his fist when the latter protested that the ship's turbolaser batteries were reaching critical failure when ordered to fire, and subsequently replaced him with another Neimoidian."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of Grievous' most defining features was a complete and utter hatred for the Jedi, and the Republic with them.

After his transformation into a cyborg, his hatred was artificially enhanced.

When he did, he took care not to mutilate her body. He also showed a certain amount of attachment to Gor, his pet roggwart, whom he doted on while housing at his lair on the third moon of Vassek. Grievous was visibly angered when Kit Fisto killed Gor, citing it as another crime for which the Jedi Order would pay dearly.

Grievous, already humiliated due to his resurrection as a cyborg, absolutely hated being referred to as a droid, and as he later would often lapsed into a violent rage when Gunray referred to him as such. The general saw Gunray as foolish, weak, and arrogant, and often secretly hoped that either Dooku or Sidious would give him leave to kill the Neimoidian. Gunray, in turn, continued to hold the view that Grievous was a servant droid, and even displayed the audacity to stand up to the General and question his orders, though he frequently backed down when the cyborg started resorting to death threats.

Trained in lightsaber combat by Dooku, he developed a personalized unorthodox fighting form, involving prolonged lightning-fast flurries and power moves designed to overwhelm his enemies. However, his lack of finesse frustrated Dooku. Each of his six-fingered arms could split lengthwise in two, thus giving Grievous the ability to use four limbs, each armed with a lightsaber. Able to spin these arms in a whirling storm of deadly lacerating light that few could withstand, he could attack with as many as 20 strikes per second, enough to overwhelm most Jedi defenses. He was also able to spin his torso and his wrists in a 360 degree motion at extremely fast speeds continuously, effectively becoming a lightsaber buzz-saw. In addition to this, Grievous had repulsorlifts built into his legs, allowing his feet to double as hands. This would allow him to wield six lightsabers all at once.

Grievous also had a tendency to use unorthodox and underhanded methods in order to win a lightsaber duel; for example, against Nahdar Vebb he used a blaster to kill him while Vebb was defending himself from his lightsabers; and against Eeth Koth, he used his MagnaGuard to shock the Jedi Councilor into submission, since the objective had been to take him alive. His lightsaber combat skills were such that he could duel even Mace Windu evenly despite having limited movement and only using two lightsabers.

One of the early concepts for Grievous was a small child sitting on a floating chair, guarded by two IG-88 droids from Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back. George Lucas rejected this look as a child would not be taken seriously as the deadliest hand to hand fighter the galaxy has seen, which is how he wanted Grievous to be portrayed.[source?] Another early concept design featured Grievous as \"a disembodied alien head, trailing a number of prehensile tentacles\". Eventually, the final look for General Grievous' face was inspired by the shape of a bathroom detergent spray nozzle. The initial design for Grievous was done by Warren Fu.

In-universe, the initial reason for the cough was that cybernetic technology wasn't advanced enough at the time. Another reason was given in Star Wars: Clone Wars Volume Two, where Mace Windu crushed Grievous's chest with the Force, and Grievous coughs after the attack. The reason for the cough is a source of great confusion for fans, as either the cough or Grievous's damaged chest were presented in several different Expanded Universe sources. A likely solution is that the cough was always present, as a result of the cybernetic technology used to recreate Grievous being not advanced enough. It then simply grew worse and more frequent, culminating with Windu's strike, which intensified Grievous's cough even more. In the 2007 History Channel program Star Wars: The Legacy Revealed, Grievous animator Rob Coleman revealed that Lucas and his team originally viewed Grievous' cough as a result of a prototype technology that the Vader suit would be the perfection of.

Jason Fry revealed in the endnotes for The Essential Guide to Warfare that he felt reconciling the differences would have been a cop-out, so he deliberately kept the backstory ambiguous, giving the in-universe explanation of conflicts between historians.

Grievous laughed, and beared over him, and Anakin unleashed his rage, driving the General back and removing all his limbs.

Aware of the Dark Jedi's destination, Grievous piloted his personal craft to the acidic world of Dica. After landing his ship, Grievous spotted the Dark Jedi and confronted one of the twin sisters. When he commanded she reveal her name, her sister appeared and engaged Grievous. Fighting together, the twins were able to sever a part of Grievous's mask and take the upper hand. However, Grievous remained confident and was able to knock the twins' lightsabers out of their hands. Much to his anger, however, the weapons landed in an acid lake. Disarmed and outgunned, the sisters quickly retreated.
