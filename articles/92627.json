Monitor herself and several surviving ships made it to the Mev system where she attempted to transfer a team of hyperdrive technicians to the Corrupter. Once again, the Monitor was unable to stop the Rebels as they finished off the convoy and proceeded to destroy the Lambda-class shuttles carrying the technicians.
