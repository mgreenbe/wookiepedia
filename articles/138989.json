In 7942 C.R.C., the Coruscant Security Force learned of the spice den from a spice-addled holo-star that they captured and interrogated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Security Force then used undercover probes to take surveillance images of the den, capturing images of two Pykes smoking spice with a human and an alien. The wealth within the group differed greatly, with one of the four working as a well-paid senatorial aide and another working as a cargo hauler earning just enough to keep them out of squalor. Inspector Tanivos Divo of the Security Force included the surveillance image and information about the den in his case files, which were later published by his grandson Exantor Divo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tach Drud's spice den was first mentioned in the 2018 reference book Star Wars: Scum and Villainy: Case Files on the Galaxy's Most Notorious, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
