Under the leadership Chief Administrator Braig Farool, TransGalMeg aligned itself firmly with the Empire. After discovering Narg in 3 BBY, the Empire granted TransGalMeg provisional protectorate authority of the world. It was the Empire's hope that by allowing TransGalMeg to manage the planet for ten years, it would give its exceptionally xenophobic Humans a chance to prepare for entrance into the galactic community. Thus, the Chief Administrator acted as Narg's planetary governor and moved the firm's corporate headquarters from Pako Ramoon in the Grohl sector to Narg. Despite its alignment with the Empire, TransGalMeg produced starships for Black Sun, and the Rebel Alliance during the height of the New Order. TransGalMeg also manufacturerd the Xiytiar-class Transport, one of which came to be known as the Hyperspace Marauder, owned by Lo Khan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Divisions"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
