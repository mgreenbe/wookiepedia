By 3637 BBY she served in the Viridian Squad under Major Tso, who said on several occasions that a girl from a rich family like Jung was unfit to lead his men. On Yavin 4 Jung led the Viridian Squad on a reconnaissance mission to the Temple of Sacrifice, but they were ambushed by the local savage Massassi. Most the team got killed, the few survivors taken captives. Jung was wounded, but attempted a rescue mission, which failed led to her death. Before dying, she left a final report for Major Tso; the report was found on her datapad by a member of the Coalition, who completed the mission and rescued her men. Upon hearing the news, Major Tso proclaimed the Viridian Squad as heroes and promised to put them all - including Era Jung - for a commendation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
