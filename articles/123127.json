The Sernpidal starport is located next to the business district. Items such as weapons and droids can be procured within the business district, which covers most of the northern half of the sprawl. Most of the goods that were found in the starport could also be found here and can be purchased at much lower prices. While the central section of the district remained tidy and well-controlled, many small businesses that cater to those with lower incomes could be found on the eastern side."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
