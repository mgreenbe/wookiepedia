During an effort to unite the Gungan villages and defeat the warlord Boss Rogoe in the war between the Gungan tribes, Boss Gallo of Otoh Sancture approached Tenko, asking for a stop to the inter-tribe violence and assistance in his quest to avenge his city, which had been destroyed by bursas under Rogoe's control. Tenko agreed but only if Gallo promised to return the Sacred Staff stolen from his village by the people of Otoh Langua, a charge denied by Boss Hantic, their leader. When Gallo discovered the missing staff in the forest, not in the possession of Otoh Langua, he returned it to Otoh Jahai, and Tenko agreed to halt attacks on Otoh Langua and lend the support of his troops to Gallo's cause by donating four heavy militiagungs. With the support of Tenko and the newly formed Gungan Grand Army, Gallo went on to unite all the Gungan tribes and defeat Rogoe, thus ending the war."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tenko was unwilling to stand down from a fight if his people were at risk.
