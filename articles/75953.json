However, the rifle could be configured to produce tracer fire if necessary. Although its penetration power was not great, the rifle's top-mounted optical scope made it highly accurate, and since it contained no powered machinery or minute sensor arrays, it could not be jammed. Also, the 1284 featured a cleaning rod, a recoil-dampening stock and an electromagnetic pulse barrel to shut down tracking devices. The rifle was also fitted with power amplification circuitry to increase its fire rate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zam Wesell began using her KiSteer 1284 on the advice of her associate Jango Fett, who believed she needed to augment and diversify her arsenal with a long-range weapon. Zam grew to admire the weapon, which she commonly kept in a secret compartment on the wing of her Koro-2 exodrive airspeeder. Zam's optical scope was configured to display targeting information in the same script as her electro-goggles. Following the second failed assassination attempt on Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, Zam used her rifle to destroy ASN-121 from a distance of twenty meters, in order to dislodge Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi. Although the assassin droid was blown apart, Kenobi ultimately survived the fall."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
