Answering to the Council of Reassignment and working closely with the Republic Agricultural Administration, this Council was one of few in the Order to allow members to be anything but a Jedi Master. The ranks of the Council consisted of Jedi Masters and simple Jedi who did not ascend past the rank of Padawan, like Jedi Gal-Stod Slagistrough. Predominantly, membership of the Council almost always consisted of at least one Ho'Din or Ithorian Master."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
