Once he had passed through the archives, Starkiller was forced to make his own route to the Jedi beacon room, due to the large amount of debris in the grand hall that surrounded the archives.

A hologram created as part of the Jedi Trials' line-up of potential Sith adversaries for Padawans near knighthood, her holocron had been activated with Starkiller's presence, releasing the phantom form of the long dead Sith Lady. Engaging each other in lightsaber combat, Phobos often changed her appearance to that of one of the few people Starkiller cared for, Captain Juno Eclipse, believing that would hold him back. However, the young Sith apprentice was unrestrained by the illusion, and savagely battled the Sith apparition. Hurling busts and holobooks around towards his opponent, Starkiller eventually pushed the Sith illusionist through four bookcases, as well as telekinetically slammed her against the walls and the ceiling after she attempted to throw her saber at him. Wounded, Phobos once again attempted her disguise in order to spare her defeat. Not fooled by the image before him, Starkiller stabbed Phobos through her back. Her image fading away signaled the end of the Trial."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Immediately after the duel's end, PROXY, Marek's holodroid companion entered with orders from Darth Vader.
