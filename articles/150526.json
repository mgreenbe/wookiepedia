Suffering minor damage in a skirmish with TIE/LN starfighters launched from the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Corrupter, the Otana escaped into hyperspace. Unfortunately, Galin discovered that the damage was more severe than they initially thought, and that the resultant coolant leak meant than it would be prudent to stop at Twin Suns Station. However, Antan was unimpressed with their reckless behavior in contacting the Rebels, and refused to give preferential treatment to the Otana on the pretext that it would be bad for business to bump customers waiting for service. Tomaas and Galin were left with no choice but to return to Azzameen Home Base in their damaged condition."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, following the apparent deaths of Tomaas and Galin and the branding of the Azzameen family as outlaws, Aeron and Ace Azzameen visited the station once more in order to retrieve some documents from a safe and a container of warheads before making their escape to the Outer Rim Territories. During their hurried visit, the Victory II-class Star Destroyer Furious arrived and launched fighters and boarding craft to seize the station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
