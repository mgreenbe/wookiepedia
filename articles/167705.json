Transcept was a surveillance company that worked for both businesses and governments including the Galactic Republic and the Galactic Empire; monitoring the profiles and consumer tastes of Gorse's transient workers and residents.

This verabal threat took place in an elevator and was witnessed by a transport driver. The camera reported to several surveillance supercomputers which comprehended the statement, measured it against mysterious metrics, and referred it to the Mynocks. This verbal threat had been made by Skelly, a dissident miner who was opposed to the Empire's blasting operations on Cynda.

One of the files concerned a mysterious man named Lemuel Tharsa, a man who had visited Gorse twenty years ago.

After Skelly blew up Vidian's Imperial shuttle in an attempt to assassinate the Count, Vidian and his surviving Imperial entourage commandeered the hoverbus and used it to travel to an Imperial spaceport at Highground.

Zaluna told Hera that she had to discuss Hera's cube later and made preparations to return home since she had missed work. She also revealed that their hoverbus had a surveillance camera board.

While checking her datapad, Zaluna received word that her entire team Myder's Mynocks had been suspended and that she had also been suspended for not showing up for her shift. Zaluna was also fearful that the Empire was going to find out that she had been in the company of rebels and that she would lose her job or worse.

After watching the material from the hoverbus surveillance, they discovered that Count Vidian was planning to destroy Gorse's moon Cynda. While Hera and Kanan reacted to Vidian's plot with disbelief, Skelly pointed out that Vidian now had the means to destroy Cynda, partly thanks to his research which the Count had misappropriated during their meeting at Moonglow. To Skelly's relief, Zaluna backed him up by pointing out that her mother had taught her during her childhood that Cynda was all brittle because of the gravitational weight generated by Gorse. She feared that Cynda's destruction was imminent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After resting the night with the rebels, Zaluna decided to travel with the rebels on Kanan's freighter Expedient and leave Gorse behind.

To reward Zaluna's services in providing data about the Empire's methods, Hera agreed to help the Sullustan start a new life in somewhere she could be safe.

They quickly discovered that Count Vidian had ordered a test bombing on Cynda which had claimed the lives of many miners including Okadiah. Vidian had ordered this test in order to investigate whether the planned detonation of the moon would destroy its thorilide crystals. To support his plan, Vidian had used his phantom mining expert Lemuel Tharsa to fake the results to show that the detonation would not damage the moon's crystal. The original report concluded otherwise but Vidian did not show it to his fellow Imperials including Captain Rae Sloane.

Before leaving, Hera asked the other rebels whether they consented to their plan. After Skelly agreed to take part, Hera turned to Zaluna. She asked Zaluna whether she wanted to go home and promised that no one would judge her for her decision. After some contemplation, Zaluna decided that she would be a brave person rather than coward. She also rejected her past as a surveillance operator and vowed never to help the Empire to oppress and imprison people again.

Zaluna picked that up after learning that the Empire had renamed Kanan's ship \"Imperial Provisional Seventy-Two.\" After arriving in the Calcoraan system, the rebels discussed their plan to stop Vidian. Hera proposed loading Kanan's freighter with explosives and using it to destroy the Calcoraan Depot. However, Skelly suggested producing a fake report that claimed that detonating Cynda would destroy the throrilide crystals in order to confuse the Imperials.

While probing through Vidian's mind, the rebels discovered that Vidian had suppressed the original test bombing report which showed that detonating Cynda would damage the thorilide crystals. After looking deeper into Vidian's memories, Zaluna and her companions discovered that Vidian had once been Lemuel Tharsa before succumbing to Shilmer's syndrome.
