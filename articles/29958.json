Like the other Sector Force, it was created from the local resistance movement: the Corellian Resistance. It was one of the most powerful Sector Force of the Rebellion and one of the most active in the early years of the conflict. Like the Bothan Sector Force, the Corellian Sector Force was known for remaining relatively independent of Fleet Command. It was likely the basis of Garm Bel Iblis's movement."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
