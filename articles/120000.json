However, Demmings almost undoubtedly holds a rank above Captain of the Line, and it is not unknown for senior personnel to base themselves in the crew pits as Sankaran does here; so in the absence of categorical evidence, it is impossible to say for sure exactly what rank and role he held."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
