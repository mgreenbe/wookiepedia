They lived in the planet's jungles and swamps millennia ago, before it became an urban environment. Before Darth Malak's bombardment during the Jedi Civil War they were believed extinct, with only a few specimens preserved in zoos. When the Republic returned to the ruins of Taris, its explorers found out that the ferrazid hounds survived and became stronger. They usually kept their distance from the small settlements in Taris's ruins, but, due to their territorial behaviour, they were a serious problem for explorers and cargos."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
