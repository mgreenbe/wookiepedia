Squad, around 19 BBY. He and his squad were sent to assist Jedi Master Treetower on Yorn Skot near the end of the Clone Wars. Treetower had been attempting to intercept Trade Federation goods being smuggled across the planet, but had been knocked unconscious and was left to hang on a unipod underneath the landing platform that contained the goods. After a successful landing on the platform, the commando leader ordered that they rappel down the platform's side to retrieve the Jedi. Mid-way they were ambushed by jump droids, and the commando was killed along with two others in the attack. Only the squad leader survived and ended up completing the mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
