Ezra's parents spoke out against the rule of the Galactic Empire by broadcasting revolutionary messages. Their actions were supported by the planet's governor, Ryder Azadi. As a result of their broadcasts, the Bridgers and Azadi were arrested and imprisoned by the Empire. Tseebo, a Rodian who lived on Lothal and was a close friend of Ephraim and Mira, promised to look after Ezra, but he was too afraid and failed to do so, leaving Ezra to live on his own for several years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ezra, who for years was unknowingly Force-sensitive, believing his parents to be dead, grew up as an orphan and con artist on Lothal during the reign of the Galactic Empire. He lived in the abandoned LothalNet comm tower E-272, where he kept a collection of stormtrooper helmets. After getting caught up with the Spectres in 3272 LY during a weapons heist in Capital City and freeing Wookiee slaves, Bridger joined the rebel crew and began training as a Jedi under Kanan Jarrus. Bridger and the crew undertook many missions together in an effort to defeat the Empire.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He eventually broadcasted his own message of rebellion to the citizens of Lothal.

Dozens of prisoners including Ryder Azadi escaped with the Bridgers's help, but Ephraim and Mira were killed during the escape. Ezra later learned of his parent's fate from Azadi. He saw his opposition to the Empire as a way to honor his parents' sacrifice.
