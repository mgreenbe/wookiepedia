Following the relative eradication of the Jedi, most of the vehicles were confiscated and repainted for Imperial use. Darth Vader was known to keep several of these starfighters on reserve, all of which were painted mostly black over the former bright colors used by the Jedi in order to better camouflage it against the backdrop of space. The color also reflected the rage and grief felt by Darth Vader during his youth as a Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Clone Wars, Darth Vader would pilot one of these interceptors during many of his early missions for Emperor Palpatine as the Great Jedi Purge continued\u2014sometimes flanked by Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing starfighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the fact that Vader had previously flown Eta-2 starfighters before his becoming a Dark Lord of the Sith, his opinion of the craft greatly diminished due to the cumbersome nature of his armor, cybernetic implants, and increased robotic height, which made it incredibly difficult for him to comfortably fit into the cramped cockpit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader would utilize one of the fighters during operations in the Atoan system. By then, several fundamental modifications had been made to the Eta-2s in Vader's possession, including a more aerodynamic placement of the thrusters and changes to the wingspan and cockpit tinting. The fighter he used at that time was badly damaged during a battle in the system against Atoan ships, and was later presumably recovered or replaced."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While seeing to operations on Kashyyyk during the Galactic Civil War, Darth Vader eventually turned one of his Eta-2 interceptors over to an Imperial agent.
