It was published on the Wizards of the Coast website on June 10, 2004 and in vignette form, told of a visit by Jedi Master Darrus Jeht to the Almas Academy. Jeht wanted to test the lightsaber skills of Masters Lanius Qel-Bertuk and Devan For'deschel. Initially, he dueled with Qel-Bertuk, and the two appeared evenly matched; that is, until Qel-Bertuk accused Jeht of holding back. In their second duel, Jeht disarmed Qel'Bertuk within moments. He then engaged both Qel-Bertuk and For'deschel at the same time, supplementing his lightsaber with a Songsteel sword."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the context of the Living Force campaign, it marked the availability of the Jedi Weapon Master prestige class from the Power of the Jedi Sourcebook, and the creation of songsteel blades by master technicians."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
