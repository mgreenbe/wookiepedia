The facility was targeted by the Galactic Republic more than once during the conflict, but its powerful force field protected it from any attack. On one occasion, Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi infiltrated the factory and destroyed its force field, but the subsequent assault by a trio of Venator-class Star Destroyers was thwarted by the arrival of the Separatist warship Starcrusher."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
