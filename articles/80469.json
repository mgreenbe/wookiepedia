The droid was programmed to act as an attorney for the defendant; however, it was also programmed to plead guilty for its \"clients\" during the trial, but could be outsmarted. With a willing judge, the accused could make a call to act as his or her own attorney, in which the droid would be unable to speak guilty for the client, as was the case of Roan Lands's trial as a traitor to the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
