The food came packaged in small flat containers that contained one long section of brown substance and three small sections of dark turquoise substance. At some point between 28 ABY and 34 ABY, Bobbajo the crittermonger gave the scavenger Rey three corn-clusters for helping to capture a bloggin that had escaped from his cages in Niima Outpost on the planet Jakku."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rey warned him not to let Unkar Plutt, the junk boss of the outpost, catch him sharing food, but Bobbajo was unconcerned as Plutt had recently been kidnapped. While Rey was trying to save Plutt from the Zendiat Collective in the nearby badlands, she dropped the corn-clusters after being pushed by Plutt. The junk boss grabbed up the packets and, after reprimanding Rey for having a secret food stash, tossed their contents into the air, attracting ripper-raptors that attacked the Collective and aided Rey and Plutt in escaping."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Corn-clusters first appeared in the comic story \"Better the Devil You Know, Part I,\" which was released on September 6, 2017.
