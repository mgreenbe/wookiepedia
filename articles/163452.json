He was married to a Corellian woman, with whom he had a son, Honesty Weft. In 232 BBY, he led a delegation which was scheduled to attend the dedication of the Starlight Beacon space station, as the Dalnans were interested in joining the Galactic Republic. He brought Honesty along, travelling to the planet Haileap from Dalna, where they boarded the starship Steady Wing. However, after the Steady Wing departed Haileap, it was destroyed in an attack of sabotage by Nihil pirates. Honesty was able to escape with a small party, but Weft and the ambassadorial delegation all died in the ship's destruction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
