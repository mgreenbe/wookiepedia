It was considered a very tough part of the arena, and many individuals had died in the Devil's Doorknob. Contestants were required to tilt their Podracers to the side so that they would be thin enough to make it through the dangerously narrow formation. The turning of the Podracer was what gave the location its name. It was the opening dividing the The Corkscrew from the Hutt Flats."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
