Yeager and Xiono arranged to rendezvous with Ryvora on the planet Castilon, who traveled their under the guise of leading a training mission. However, the mission was complicated when First Order Security Bureau Agent Tierny discovered Ryvora's defection and dispatched their Resurgent-class Star Destroyer after them. Despite being captured by the First Order and exposing the Colossus to First Order pursuers, the team managed to sabotage the Star Destroyer's shield generator and escape the warship before it was destroyed during a skirmish in the Barabesh system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tamara Ryvora was an aspiring racer who left her homeworld of Kuat to pursue a racing career at the Colossus refueling platform on the planet Castilon. However, her plans did not work out and Ryvora fell on hard times. Destitute, she was forced to sell her racer but found lodging and work with Jarek Yeager, a former New Republic starfighter pilot who owned a repair station at the Colossus. Tam worked as a mechanic and hoped to earn enough money to buy the old racer known as the Fireball."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ryvora's working relationship with Yeager was complicated by the arrival of undercover Resistance spy Kazuda Xiono, who was on a mission to spy on First Order activity on the Colossus. Ryvora grew frustrated with Kaz's unexplained offworld trips and Yeager's perceived leniency towards Kaz. After the First Order raided Yeager's repair station following Kaz's intrusion into First Order space, Ryvora thought it was a misunderstanding and surrendered herself to the authorities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The First Order Security Bureau Agent managed to turn Ryvora against Kaz and Yeager by revealing that the former was a Resistance spy and claiming that the latter had taken advantage of her by withholding information from her. Tam's anger and resentment towards Kaz and Yeager led her to join the First Order during the Attack on Castilon, which saw the Team Colossus liberate the Colossus from First Order rule and escape into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ryvora became a First Order TIE Fighter Pilot cadet during the First Order's hunt for the Colossus, training alongside former Colossus residents Jace Rucklin and Lin Gaava. Over time, Ryvora came to question her commitment to the First Order due to her encounter with Resistance pilot Venisa Doza. Ryvora also secretly helped former friends Xiono and Neeku Vozo steal a Trans-binary deflector for the Colossus. Despite rising to the rank of Lieutenant, Ryvora's disillusionment with the First Order peaked after the First Order destroyed an Aeosian village during the Suppression of the Aeos system. Deciding to defect, Ryvora retrieved her comlink from Tierny's office. With the help of  the mouse droid 5-L, she transmitted a coded transmission to Xiono with arrangements to rendezvous on Castilon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Helping a friend"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kaz, Neeku, and Yeager received Tamara's coded transmission. While Yeager thought it could be a trap, Kaz did not want to abandon Tam. Yeager agreed to accompany Kaz and the two sought Captain Imanuel Doza's permission. Though Doza was skeptical, Kaz believed that Tam had a genuine change of heart. Kaz was supported by Yeager and Doza's own wife Commander Venisa Doza, who said they would rescue their daughter if she was in the same position. Doza relented and allowed Kaz, Yeager, and CB-23 to borrow a former First Order Atmospheric Assault Lander to travel to a foregone racing ring near the former site of the Colossus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Tam took her squadron of three TIE/sf space superiority fighters, which were capable of hyperspace travel to Castilon on a training mission. She was accompanied by Rucklin, who was committed to the First Order. Upon arriving, Rucklin recognized the Lander as a stolen First Order shuttle. Despite Tam's orders not to engage, Rucklin managed to convince the other pilots to open fire on the Lander. Tam was forced to knock him out and used her TIE fighter to shoot them down."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tam had a reunion with Yeager and Kaz on the racing ring. Though Yeager was still angry that Tam had left them to join the First Order, Kaz managed to defuse the situation by telling them they could resolve their differences later.

Before the ship's capture, Yeager deleted the shuttle's flight logs and set the ship to self-destruct. While Tam and a still loyal Rucklin surrendered to Commander Pyre, Agent Tierny, and several stormtroopers, Kaz, Yeager, and CB-23 sneaked out of the ship through the maintenance hatches. While Tam confirmed that she had abandoned the First Order, Rucklin tried to prove his loyalty by revealing that the Colossus was in the Barabesh system. Pyre was unmoved and ordered that the two cadets be executed by First Order stormtrooper executioners for treason."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the shuttle exploded, Kaz, Yeager, and CB-23 took the opportunity to flee the hangar and infiltrate the ship.

After knocking him unconscious, Tam confirmed that the First Order had discovered the location of the Colossus due to Rucklin's treachery. The three decided that they had to warn the Colossus that the Star Destroyer was coming after them.

The Colossus residents were initially distressed by Kaz and Tam's message but several residents including Aunt Z, Synara San, and Bolza Grool urged them to fight back. Though they managed to warn the Colossus, their frequency allowed the First Order to home in on their location. Tam and her rescuers fled down a maintenance hatch which led to a hangar.

Kaz was pinned down by a large box. Pyre attempted to execute him with his BL-155 Laser ax but CB-23 used her grappling cable to grab his ax.
