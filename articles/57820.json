They were employed as bodyguards, sentries, and wardens. Their personality matrixes tended towards demanding, even abusive behavior, and their programming allowed them to use weapons in a lethal capacity if needed. They were outclassed by combat droids and assassin droids in terms of sheer combat ability, but were well equipped to handle the tasks they were assigned to handle.
