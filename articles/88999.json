To get access to Arpagion's cell at the Dex Acquisitions Depot, Leia had the Wookiee Chewbacca pose as a bounty hunter who had captured her. Upon hearing this, the depot's leader, Arty-Ba, told their partner to take Organa to the ultra-security cells. Chewbacca threw both depot workers into a wall, knocking them both unconscious. Han Solo and Luke Skywalker blasted their way into the brig with a breaching torpedo, rescuing Arpagion from his cell and leaving in the Millennium Falcon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meor Ain first appeared in the canon comic Star Wars 45, which was written by Kieron Gillen, illustrated by Salvador Larroca and published on March 21, 2018."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
