They were also were known to chase down droids, though whether or not droids acted as an actual source of nutrition for the creatures is uncertain. The quadrupeds were also known to continuously bark noises that sounded like \"nog.\" They had green skin and large yellow-green eyes. They moved about on four large limbs, though they could also run solely on their hind legs for a short duration. Their forelimbs could grasp things, do to an opposable thumb.
