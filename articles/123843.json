In order to reprimand his student, Upulu sent Shalimin to the planet Argul to serve under Grand Master Yoda in the battle there. Greatly disliking the world, Shalimin nonetheless fought alongside other master-less Padawans against the Separatist Droid Army, forcing an uneasy stand-off until reinforcements arrived, which led to a Republic victory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shalimin made his only appearance in Only the Force, a scenario for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game.
