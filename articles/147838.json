Near the home was a cave that allowed Gundy and Jann to search for Keshels, the currency of the planet of Tyne's Horky. In 15 BBY, Tosh allowed his droids, C-3PO and R2-D2 to stay after he purchased them from Yorpo Mog, and later housed Mon Julpa back to health at the residence. After a cave-in occurred in the cave, Gundy was injured but relished at the fact that the cave in caused Keshels to be uncovered, making the family rich, as Gundy stated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
