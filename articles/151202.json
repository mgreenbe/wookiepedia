Heren sought to sell it to Haka Hai, but during a stop on New Plympto, the ship decided to help fugitives Bomo Greenbark and Dass Jennir search for the former's family. However, they ended up in a dead end as Bomo's wife was killed and his daughter was eaten. Jennir killed the slave master and the girl's eater, infuriating Greenbark into revealing that he was a Jedi. After Jennir disappeared and Bomo integrated with them, the crew returned to their original objective. However, as a safety measure, Heren placed the Box in a crate in the rings of an ice giant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Mimban, Heren's fears turned out to be true, as Hai tried to steal the crate without paying. After a three-way battle between the crew, Hai and his right-hand Lumbra, the crew was imprisoned to determine the real crate's location. Bomo, using his wits, killed Hai and his thugs, and they departed the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Three weeks later, in the Expansion Region, the Uhumele retrieved the crate. Heren, more determined to get rid of it, planned to sell it to Fane Peturri, a well-known historian, who had no underworld connections. But he was an agent of the Empire, who learned from Janks about the crate. When they arrived with the crate, Peturri was waiting with Darth Vader and stormtroopers from the 501st Legion. The Uhumele then promptly escaped, evading a force of two Venator-class Star Destroyers and fighters pursuing it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, the remaining crew ended up on Kidron, where Captain Heren got drunk, and the crew encountered Jedi fugitive Beyghor Sahdett."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Crew"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
