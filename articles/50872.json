Scathe placed the Ithorian Hoolar Freeb in charge of the operations against Frosch Industries. In 1 ABY, the Frosch researchers seemed to have fallen behind the Cabal's client in the race for a better bacta solution after the Cabal had staged continual operations against Frosch Industries. When it appeared that the bacta technology that Frosch Industries was working on was nearing completion, Freeb was activated to sabotage their research and slow them down even more."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Freeb planned an operation that would not only slow their progress, but actually result in the company firing key personnel for incompetence. Freeb tasked one of the Cabal's enforcers to infiltrate the research facility near Kor Vella and acquire a diagram of the chemical structure of their bacta matter. Then the mercenary accessed the lab's computers and manipulated the research records. This manipulation made it impossible for Frosch Industries to create the bacta solution."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Frosch Industries appeared in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
