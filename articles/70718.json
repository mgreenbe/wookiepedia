Zlato's Place specialized in Toydarian dishes, and a dozen Toydarians worked there. However, this restaurant was merely a front for Jeseej's forgery company, and as such, he was comfortable with the fact that the restaurant consistently failed to make a profit. In addition to the twelve Toydarians, Jeseej employed two Squibs able to duplicate an ID card in less than an hour and had a reputation as a skilled forger. In order to meet with the Sljee, a client had to give the correct password to Jessej's Toydarian host, and then pick a certain entr\u00e9e off a special menu. Only then would the individual be led to see Jeseej in a small room beyond the kitchen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jeseej was also Force-sensitive and ran a side business as a fortune teller, using his connection to the Force to predict the future for clients of the Coruscant underworld. These customers found his premonitions to be trustworthy, and many of them began focusing their black-market operations around his predictions. Jeseej had a great deal of knowledge about the Coruscant Underworld and was happy to share information in exchange for a healthy sum of credits. He was very careful to avoid attracting the attention of planetary security officials, cautiously running his businesses in secrecy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the few Sljee on Coruscant, Jeseej was very well-versed in the Coruscant underlevels. He had a strong will and was skilled at gathering information. Due to this, he gained a reputation as a talented and trustworthy forger and information dealer who provided useful news. As a fortune teller, Jeseej was highly valued, and his clients found his premonitions to be advantageous and uncannily accurate. His restaurant employees were very loyal to him. Though his restaurant was unprofitable, Jeseej was unconcerned, as its true goal was to serve as a front for his less-than-legal dealings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like all Sljee, Jeseej was blind, forcing him to require on his sense of touch and hearing. He resembled a gray table with tentacles and stumpy legs, a trait shared by all members of his species. Like other Sljee, he was easily mistaken for a motile plant or a sort of bizarre animal. He could speak both Sljee and Galactic Basic Standard, was skilled at repairing machines, and had knowledge of organic biology."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jeseej was created for the 2003 sourcebook Coruscant and the Core Worlds.
