The plant has several three-meter-long tendrils with which to ensnare its prey, and large mouth that could reach anything within a two-meter radius. The mouth was made up of three modified leaves arranged in an oval shape and mounted on the half-meter-thick stalk. The plant was generally colored with orange and red leaves. Feeding on small animals, the plant could consume prey up to two meters long. It did not care what its prey was, and could go months between feedings. The plant lay in wait until a suitable target came within range of its tendrils, then it struck, ensnaring the target and drawing it towards its maw. Once inside the maw, digestive juices could dissolve prey within a matter of minutes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
