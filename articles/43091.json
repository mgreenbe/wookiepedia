Like most wingriders, he was smaller and shorter than a typical Drall. He had tan fur, which grew longer on his head, where he braided it into elaborate curls with beads. Elamm felt most comfortable above-ground, unlike most Drall, who stayed underground whenever possible. He patrolled the skies mounted on his ibbot named Sha'lott. He possessed a natural affinity for animals, ibbots especially, and felt more comfortable with them than with his fellow Drall."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
