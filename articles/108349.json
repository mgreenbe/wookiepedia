Created by the company owned by the famed weapon designer Galen and his sister Curi, they were similar to the B1-Series battle droids that were ubiquitous around the galaxy at the time. However, they had better armor and their targeting systems were much more accurate. Like the B1 battle droids, they could be transported in Multi-Troop Transports. Galen, after releasing a deadly toxin on his home planet, gave the ambassador to Avon the control codes to his droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
