Shortly before the destruction of Alderaan, she was preparing to join the Imperial Navy. Despite her extensive natural talent in naval strategy, being a woman meant that she would have likely remained a junior officer for her entire career. Upon learning of her homeworld's destruction, she and several other Alderaanians with whom she traveled made the last-minute decision to defect to the Rebel Alliance. She served with distinction at the Battle of Yavin, Hoth and Endor as a military attach\u00e9 to General Crix Madine, helping him to coordinate operations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
