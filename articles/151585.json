After serving with a mercenary group, he went on a wild killing spree through a starport on the planet Kal'Shebbol in the Kathol sector of the Outer Rim Territories. Massacring civilians and Imperial soldiers alike, Lagor was eventually imprisoned by the forces of the planet's ruler, Imperial warlord Moff Kentor Sarne, and kept in the detention cells of the Imperial headquarters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Freed during the New Republic's assault on the planet in 8 ABY, Lagor subsequently joined the crew of the CR90 corvette FarStar when they began recruiting from the planet's civilian population due to a manpower shortage. The New Republic had tasked the ship with tracking down Sarne, who had fled his capital following the liberation of Kal'Shebbol. Lagor, having developed a hatred for the Moff and Imperials in general, claimed he was a political prisoner and was assigned as a heavy weapons specialist. He kept quiet about the reason for his incarceration, fearing that if the truth was known he would be ejected from the ship via an airlock. Lagor remained aboard the vessel until it reached the planet Kathol, where Sarne was finally defeated in a decisive battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unda Lagor, a male Aqualish of the Quara subspecies, served as a member of a renegade mercenary group, and, during his time with them, he gained experience with repeating blasters and blaster artillery. He eventually left the mercenaries and found himself on the planet Kal'Shebbol in the Kathol sector of the Outer Rim Territories around 8 ABY. Kal'Shebbol was part of the dominion of Moff Kentor Sarne, an Imperial warlord who had seceded from the Empire following the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY. Sometime prior to the New Republic's liberation of the planet in 8 ABY, Lagor went on a blaster rampage through one of the busiest sectors of Kal'Shebbol's starport. The Aqualish ransacked several buildings and killed forty-three civilians and twenty-one Imperial troops before he was finally captured and incarcerated in the dungeons of Sarne's headquarters. His excuse for his actions was that he was simply having a bad day."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the New Republic liberated Kal'Shebbol, elements of Page's Commandos released prisoners from the dungeons during the battle while searching for a New Republic operative, a Wookiee by the name of Lofryyhn. Freed from his cell, Lagor escaped the facility, pausing only to acquire the blast helmet and vest from the dead body of an Imperial trooper, one of many whom Sarne left behind to defend his palace while the Moff fled the planet. With Sarne ousted from Kal'Shebbol, the New Republic authorized the CR90 corvette FarStar to travel into the Kathol sector to track down the rogue Moff. However, due to a lack of available manpower, the New Republic was forced to recruit from Kal'Shebbol's civilian population to crew the ship. Eager to get even with the warlord, Lagor signed up for the mission by claiming to have been one of the Moff's political prisoners. He was accepted and assigned as one of the corvette's heavy weapons specialists. During the months-long mission, Lagor had the habit of trying to get himself assigned to ground missions as \"firepower support\" so that he could shoot at something."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to his imprisonment, Lagor had developed a hatred for Sarne and, by extension, all Imperials. Many of the crew feared that he would focus his wrath on Jessa Dajus, a former member of Sarne's forces who was part of the corvette's command staff, as she openly wore her Imperial uniform while on duty. However, the Aqualish was afraid that Dajus knew the real reason he had been in the detention cells, and did not want that information spreading to the rest of the crew for fear that they would eject him from an airlock. As a result, he deliberately avoided Dajus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the FarStar neared the end of its mission, the crew landed on the planet Kathol. While attempting to rally the native Yapi against the combined might of Sarne's Imperial forces and the DarkStryder, a bio-engineered lifeform ruling the planet, members of the crew were invited to take a Test to prove their worth. The Test consisted of six jars\u2014five empty and one containing a captive Maoi\u2014placed in a ten-meter-deep pit. The candidate, armed only with a club, had to smash at least two of the jars without releasing the Maoi, an amorphous lifeform that attacked prey by assaulting the face, then slithering down the assailant's throat to devour their internal organs. If the Maoi was released, then the candidate failed the Test and usually died from the Maoi's attack unless they were able to escape or subdue the creature. Lagor was one of several crew members who was considered as a potential candidate to take the Test to secure the assistance of the Yapi in the subsequent battle that saw the end of both Sarne and the DarkStryder."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An Aqualish, Unda Lagor was a member of the Quara subspecies, possessing five-fingered hands. Lagor had tan skin, black eyes, and tufts of white facial hair. He was an antagonistic individual who took pleasure in inciting violence or murdering others and was often irritable if he had not \"done good death.\" Following his imprisonment in Moff Sarne's dungeons, Lagor harbored a vengeance against Sarne and, by extension, any other Imperial he encountered. The Aqualish used bullying tactics to get his own way, although he was afraid that his targets would join forces and seek their revenge on him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lagor was never far away from his preferred weapon, a light repeating blaster, and often carried it slung over his shoulder. However, he was fond of turning around and whacking others with it, seemingly by accident. He was also trained in blaster artillery, vehicle-mounted weapons, and melee combat. He could drive repulsorlift vehicles. During Lagor's assignment on the FarStar, he wore the blast helmet and vest that he had taken from the corpse of a dead Imperial soldier during his escape from the detention cells."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unda Lagor was created for The DarkStryder Campaign, a multi-book adventure for Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game by West End Games. Lagor is a member of the support crew of the FarStar, and the gamemaster and players are given free reign to develop the Aqualish's character during the adventure if they so wish, since the designers did not plan to include him in future supplements. Despite this, Lagor did receive a mention in the final book of the campaign, Endgame. His entry was written by Peter M. Schweighofer, and his illustration was provided by Mike Vilardi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
