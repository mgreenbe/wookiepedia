The crime leader Jabba the Hutt sent his two favorite smugglers, Han Solo and Chewbacca to Gamorr to pick up more guards. Their primary point of contact was a Gamorrean farmer, and they required a translator to negotiate. Solo refused to work with a droid, but Jabba blackmailed him by threatening to give the contract to BoShek. Solo agreed and the three boarded his ship, the Millennium Falcon. During the transit in hyperspace, TC-72 did not ingrain herself to the smuggler by her refusal to cease talking. Eventually, Solo taped her vocabulator shut and shut her in the cargo bay."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the smugglers landed, Solo removed the tape from her vocabulator so she could negotiate with their contact.
