At some stage either during or before the Imperial era, the Sun King and his siblings came across the season scepter, a Force-imbued relic that allowed the user to control the moon's seasons. The device was also a potent weapon. The Sun King was given jurisdiction over the season of summer on Endor, while his siblings gained the same power over winter, autumn and spring. He set up residence in a palace in the lands near Bright Tree Village. It was not a substantial structure, but it featured a large pool, and he was able to host both parties and seasons from there. His palace was also the home of the season scepter itself. From there, he set himself up as a local god."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Odra crisis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Imperial era, the Snow King was seduced by Odra, the Duchess of Sleet. After entering into a tumultuous affair with the Duchess, the Snow King seceded from his alliance with his siblings, and went independent. His heart was frozen by Odra, and so his siblings were unable to talk with him cordially. Tensions between the two factions were heightened when the Snow King's Iceheads, under the direction of the Duchess, infiltrated the Sun King's palace, and stole the season scepter. The Sun King, who was in a conference with a loyalist group of furry so-called \"dudes,\" did not initially notice the theft, and when he did, he had his cocktail frozen by the infiltrators. Frightened, he hid under his deck chair, and so the Icehead Commandos were able to escape with a minimum of fuss. Distraught, the Sun King summoned his sisters to the palace. Events took a shocking turn when the Snow King used the scepter to initiate a perpetual winter over a large portion of the Forest Moon.

However, the elderly Ewok was absent, and the communiqu\u00e9 was received by Wicket Wystri Warrick. Warrick was unable to locate Logray, and so, took up the task himself. Accompanied by the Princess of Bright Tree Village, Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka, Logray's apprentice, Teebo, and actress Latara, Warrick flew to the Sun King's palace by way of flying leaf. However, their flight did not go to plan. Odra dispatched Ice Heads to assassinate Warrick and his entourage en route to the palace.
