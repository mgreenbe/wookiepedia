The screen then cuts to space, where two rings of the cereal fuse to form an \"8\" shape. A human real-life boy is then shown eating the cereal, followed by a suggestion of how to complement the cereal with your breakfast. The screen cuts back to the desert planet in a cave, where C-3PO has delivered the cereal to a pleased patron.
