Well on his way to Jedi Knighthood, he had, in the mind of his Master, experienced much growth in the six months since galactic criminal Jenna Zan Arbor's escape from Vanqor. Anakin was now able to mask the turbulence within him when frustration and anger and petty emotions threatened to rise and overflow, and Obi-Wan Kenobi was impressed with his Padawan's progress. Skywalker, with his calm, composed fas\u00e7ade, at least, in such situations, looked to be completely, perfectly in control. So it was now with Anakin, when he stood with Kenobi, Siri Tachi and her Padawan, Ferus Olin, in Meeting Room A3000291 of the Galactic Senate on Coruscant, to hear more bureaucratic nonsense from their friend and Senate aide Tyro Caladian: the Senate had refused the Jedi admittance to Romin, a small Mid-Rim planet ruled by a ruthless dictator, Roy Teda\u2014one who had made himself rich by offering his world as a refuge to most-wanted criminals willing to pay a hefty bribe. The patience and composure of all four Jedi was at this moment severely tested."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having, between and during subsequent Jedi missions, traced rumors and found additional clues in tracking Zan Arbor, the Master-Padawan team knew the mad scientist's funds were near depletion\u2014both her large fortune that the Senate had confiscated and dispersed among the many planets she had wronged and anything that remained from what the Vanqors had paid her. But because the Jedi knew Zan Arbor liked to live, not only well, but extravagantly, this weakness for fine things became her undoing when Anakin discovered her purchase of a limited-production Luxe Flightwing cruiser, beautiful and rare. Many had remembered it\u2014fuelers, repair personnel, customs officials, pilots\u2014and Zan Arbor's acquisition of the luxury star cruiser, while typical of her arrogance and greed, proved unwise, for the information trail it left behind led to Romin, where she now hid behind Teda's protective walls and believed herself safe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To accompany Kenobi and Skywalker in their arrest of the elusive scientist were fellow Jedi Tachi and Olin. Kenobi had requested their help because they, too, had been involved with the search for Zan Arbor in the past, and Tachi had pledged her services to Obi-Wan in the criminal's final capture. But now the Senate had denied them entrance to Romin to achieve this long-sought goal. For while the Senate was committed to capturing Zan Arbor, and Teda was, without question, in violation of many Republic laws (including imprisonment and execution without trial, torture to extract information, control of all global communications, raiding of the planetary treasury), the Senate yet recognized him\u2014incredulously, to the Jedi and to Caladian\u2014as a \"duly elected ruler\" (despite Teda having rigged the elections) and was adamant to recognize Romin's sovereignty and respect its law. That law stipulated barring entrance to all bounty hunters, which the Senate apparently considered the Jedi, in this case, to be\u2014again, to the utter consternation of Kenobi and his gathered team. For none, according to Romin law, were permitted to arrest or transport a galactic criminal offworld. It was this promised relocation and asylum for criminals that insured Teda his continued personal prosperity; he was therefore committed to forcibly expelling or making to 'disappear' any and all bounty hunters found on the planet by his security police. All of this Caladian reported to them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anakin, who felt no compunction about bending the rules to go to Romin without Senate approval, clashed with his longtime rival Ferus, who ever abided by those rules. Oddly, Olin's Master, Tachi, was more of Skywalker's temperament\u2014always geared for action, unafraid to boldly speak her mind and fit the rules to the need at hand, much like Anakin. The bright indignation in her blazing blue eyes as she questioned the Senate's rationale did not make the Svivreni aide, with his black plume of flowing hair, feel at ease. But while Caladian empathized with the Jedi frustration, he could not see a way through to reach their goal\u2014unlike Kenobi, for whom a way was made clear. For Obi-Wan was ever mindful of his own Master's wisdom: There is always another way, Qui-Gon had often told him. Because the Senate was effectively shielding a notorious criminal (which was why Zan Arbor felt safe and that she could afford to be reckless), Obi-Wan felt fully justified in impersonating a notorious gang of thieves\u2014the Slams\u2014in order to gain entrance to Romin. The Slams, who'd recently escaped the Greylands Security Complex on Tentator, had been tracked down and re-committed to prison only hours before, according to Caladian. It had been Caladian himself, in fact, who, while bemoaning the galaxy's rising lawlessness and the state of its prisons, had sparked Kenobi's idea of criminal impersonation to get onworld."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Final shifts: poised for deception"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Vanqor, at mission's end, Anakin had at last been able to name his nameless dread: that he feared his destiny, a fear felt in every waking moment it seemed; that often he wished he was not \"the Chosen One\"\u2014it was a break-out confession that, in its audible enunciation, had oddly liberated him and drawn him closer to his Master. That freedom of release had remained for Anakin a phenomenon and a wonder, for he still didn't understand it. But the unburdening of his heart to Obi-Wan had truly made them Master and Padawan now\u2014enabled them to achieve a classic step in the Master-Padawan relationship: The apprentice invites the Master, and it begins. It had taken time, but the trust was there\u2014Anakin felt he could entrust his Master with the inner workings of his heart and mind, his deepest fears, his worst nightmares. That invitation of intimate sharing had shifted and deepened their relationship. It was indeed a new beginning for them, just as it had been for Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon in the middle of their journey together. The two now read one another beautifully, took their steps in classic sync\u2014all of it, for Anakin, mysterious and wonderful."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His Master's inspired new plan which, whereas Siri remained dubious, Anakin was excited about, would allow them to extract Zan Arbor from Romin without violating any planetary laws or Senate regulations: simply by entering legally as criminals. They would assume the identities of the Slam gang, with Kenobi as con man Slam, Tachi as ID theft expert Valadon, Anakin as security expert Waldo, and Ferus as weapons and defense expert Ukiah. They needed somehow, as criminals, to lure Zan Arbor off-planet\u2014something that would simply be, in Siri's sarcastic view, quoting legendary pilot Garen Muln, a \"piece of sweetcake.\" They needed Caladian's help to secure for them not only false ID docs and background information, but also the Slam gang's confiscated ship, which, if it had indeed traveled about the Core, was surely a spaceworthy vessel. Obi-Wan also needed Tyro to make sure that the authorities agreed to keep the Slam gang's capture a secret until the Jedi mission was completed. The entire scheme had to be cleared by the presiding officer of the Jedi High Council, Master Mace Windu. But Kenobi confided in Windu's own conviction of the critical imperative of Zan Arbor's capture for the safety of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anakin, in listening to Obi-Wan and Siri discuss the specifics of the plan, again felt liberated. Suddenly gone was the frustration of, having located Zan Arbor, not being able to apprehend her. Now they were free to do so. But Anakin still felt a chill in contemplating the actual moment of taking her into custody, for he remembered her intense focus on him and his special abilities as she held him ensnared within a fabricated peace in the Zone of Self-Containment on Vanqor. For the first time in his life he'd achieved a seeming true serenity while in \"the Zone,\" but the experience had left him feeling hollow, plagued yet with the guilt and fear that he'd ever sought to escape from. But some good, also, had risen from the experience: for it left Anakin feeling vulnerable and afraid\u2014enough to lean on his Master and discover that Obi-Wan indeed cared deeply for him. Anakin thus carried away a marvelous gift from that uncertain time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ferus, on the other hand, looked dubious, troubled. When Siri queried what was on his mind, Ferus said he felt that their intended foray was not appropriate for the Jedi to make. They were not tricksters. Venturing forth as impostors was a far cry from the ambassadors of peace and justice that the Jedi claimed to be. Squelching the urge to roll his eyes, Anakin couldn't help admire the patience and understanding of both Jedi Masters in wanting to help Ferus the rulekeeper to understand that the galaxy was complex, in that the Jedi must often take risks and embrace unconventional methods to accomplish critical ends for the greater good. Siri mentioned her undercover assignment to infiltrate the crimelord Krayn's vast pirating and slavery operation, in which she had to appear, to friend and foe alike, to actually have abandoned the Jedi Order and turned to the dark side. Every moment of that deception, wherein she was required both to lie and to live a lie, went against her very core and took its toll. But was she glad she did it? Yes. For the Jedi were able to bring down a vicious pirate and liberate hundreds of slaves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Obi-Wan, too, recalled his past entanglement with the mad scientist they were now pursuing. A great enemy of the Jedi, Zan Arbor imprisoned Qui-Gon and drained his life, almost killing him, in order to study the Force, when Kenobi was a young Padawan. She was responsible for the deaths of multitudes of beings and was seeking again now to subdue entire populations with her new drug, the Zone of Self-Containment. Because the lives of perhaps millions were at stake, she had to be stopped\u2014even if that meant forsaking their Jedi dignity for a few days. Anakin knew that Ferus' dignity was what was most tender in Ferus' soul. His face flushed at Kenobi's clear but gentle rebuke, conceding to the greater wisdom of his Masters. Yet all could sense a residual unease within him. Turning again to the pressing need at hand, if all went well, they could, after briefing Windu, embark for Romin that night. Anakin noted that somehow the tables had shifted between him and his rival: for once, Ferus appeared to be the outsider, not him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Journey to Romin"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tyro Caladian, a true friend and an invaluable contact for the Jedi in the Senate, had been able to accomplish all that Obi-Wan Kenobi had asked of him. Meeting with him and his apprentice in one of the Jedi Temple's small meeting rooms, Tyro gave them the news. Though still in negotiations with the Central Posting Service to secure an indefinite Stop Comm order to suppress the announcement of the Slam gang's arrest to law enforcement agencies and the HoloNet news service, Caladian was successful in requisitioning the criminals' ship. Tyro had secured a waiver from the Senate Security Committee to meet with the Overseer of Prison Worlds, who then issued a release order to the Senate's Confiscation Authority to allow the Jedi to commandeer the Slams' ship\u2014a Ubrikkian star yacht\u2014which, after their Caladian-supplied documents had been accepted, they navigated out of the Greylands Confiscation Station hangar. Within hours, the four Jedi were streaking across the stars toward Romin, one standard day away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mace Windu had given them his blessing, understanding the urgent need, though, like Olin, he was not happy about the rule-bending. All of the Slams' data records, ID text docs, and wardrobes were onboard the light cruiser. It seemed to amuse Tyro to be able to tell Obi-Wan that he understood Slam to be somewhat of a \"dandy.\" Finally, in the manner of the Svivreni, with raised palm to palm and fingers spread, Caladian had bid Kenobi a fond farewell, a gesture made only with those closest to them: \"The journey begins, so go.\" Considering it bad luck, Tyro's people never said good-bye."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they commenced the flight to Romin, Siri found a detailed analysis of the Senate Relief Fund's accounting practices rolled into a small hidden compartment under the cockpit dash, and also a device to override iris scans, which suggested the Slams were planning to rob the Senate depository\u2014a big job even for them, Kenobi observed. Tachi reminded them of the criminal gossip network and their need to be apprised of the latest criminal tech scams, as they needed to be the Slams. But it was upon discovering the gang's questionable wardrobes that the stark reality of their situation hit them head-on. Kenobi's attire was certainly tailored for a \"dandy\"\u2014a purple veda-cloth cloak with an embroidered collar of thick, bright-green braiding, paired with red polished-leather boots. Tachi insisted he don the outfit, to both her and the Padawans' great amusement: unable to restrain themselves any longer, they pealed with laughter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Obi-Wan, meanwhile, lost no time in tossing to Siri Valadon's tiny, rather revealing soft-blue septsilk garment, which, of course, Tachi promptly refused to put on. Kenobi then quoted back to her verbatim her words to him about the desire to ensnare Zan Arbor and what such a prize demanded. Appeasing her audience only nominally, she draped the flowing feminine article over her rough Jedi tunic and leggings\u2014an uproarious spectacle. More conventional garments, dark tunics and trousers, were tossed to Anakin and Ferus. Skywalker, due to his recent run-in with Zan Arbor, was additionally given a headgear disguise (used to knit synth-flesh together after an injury) that Kenobi had acquired at the Temple med clinic: they would tell others, if asked, that Waldo was wounded in the prison escape. The mask fit over his forehead and covered half of Anakin's face, leaving only his mouth and chin uncovered, with tinted lenses for eyesight. Skywalker was grateful for a shield from what he remembered as being Zan Arbor's penetrating gaze, her desire to crack his Jedi essence and ensnare him again in the Zone of Self-Containment. He never again wanted to find himself under its counterfeit influences and hoped the deranged 'doctor' would not recognize him. It was almost certain Zan Arbor would not recognize Kenobi, who had met her only briefly more than 18 years before."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Obi-Wan's comlink signaled Tyro's last communication to them before arriving on Romin, set in holomode for all to see and hear: the mini-Svivreni announced that he had been able, unfortunately, to insure secrecy of the Slams' capture for three standard days only. It would have to be enough time to track down and extricate Zan Arbor from the planet."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Arrival on the tyrant-world"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon arriving on the world run on bribes paid to Roy Teda, Anakin Skywalker guided the Slams' cruiser down on the sparsely populated Teda Landing Platform, situated high in the clouds above Romin's capital city of Eliior. Obi-Wan Kenobi watched in amusement as Siri Tachi was the first to athletically stride down the ramp: she wore now a lilac shimmersilk robe tied with a rose-colored sash embroidered in delicate gold thread. Over the sash she had insisted on wearing her battered utility belt (all the Jedi had concealed their lightsabers, except Siri, whose outfit was simply too revealing to conceal anything, so Obi-Wan carried hers). The contrasts were such that Kenobi seriously doubted whether Tachi could pull off Valadon's \"trademark flirtatiousness,\" and so it was good the mission would be short."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anakin was the first to notice Zan Arbor's elegant new ship in a nearby hangar. An ornately dressed security officer met them at ramp's end. Upon inspecting the ID docs of the new arrivals, he asked their purpose in coming to Romin, to which Kenobi disclosed their desire to relocate and requested a tour of the city as he passed over a bundle of credits. With a practiced finesse the officer slipped them into his pocket and retired to a console to enter their ID data and to place a communication. Discovering them to be escaped criminals, of course, the undercover Jedi were promptly granted entrance to Romin. The officer's name was Becka, and he came back to report that, due to their status as important guests, \"Great Leader Teda\" himself wished to extend a personal welcome to the Slams at his grand palace, to which Becka would escort them after a brief city tour."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After taking a large turbolift down to the planet's surface, they boarded a six-seat airspeeder and glided out onto a wide boulevard with little traffic. Expounding the virtues of their noble city and leader, Becka painted for them a utopia of bliss for all planetary citizens\u2014both for those within the capital and outside its walls. The battered security wall that Kenobi suddenly noticed rising hundreds of meters from the ground buzzed with guard- and surveillance droids. Asking Becka what it was, the security officer gave another rose-colored response: it was the Cloudflower Wall for those citizens who \"preferred\" to live outside the city. In truth, Kenobi knew already from Tyro's briefing that Eliior was populated by the world's wealthy; its oppressed workers, who were required to have passes to enter the city, lived outside the city walls in concentric rings of misery\u2014hovels that grew progressively worse, the greater their distance from the capital. Touring the commerce district, the exclusive shops filled with luxurious goods obviously lacked customers: few could be seen within or without. Next came the palatial residences, glimpsed only behind fortified walls. Made of stone and durasteel, the grand structures were framed by lush gardens and sparkling fountains. Their occupants never went anywhere except under heavy guard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The boulevard ended at Teda's grand palace complex, lushly landscaped, which the Slams were ushered into at a security checkpoint. Becka dropped the new arrivals off at the durasteel doors of the main entrance and bid them a friendly farewell. Teda himself, clad in multicolored robes, promptly exited to extend a flowery, redundant greeting. Kenobi, shifting even more so into his 'Slam' mode, put on flamboyant airs as he introduced his companions. Cozying immediately up to the attractive 'Valadon,' stroking her arm with his finger and calling her \"prettier than a cloudflower,\" Teda's uninvited intimacy drew from Siri a smile that \"seemed fixed with a strong adhesive\" to her face. Seemingly delighted with everything Tachi had to say, Teda offered her and her companions a small nearby villa, currently up for sale and unoccupied, in which to stay for their first days on Romin\u2014unless, of course, they wished to buy it, which they also were perfectly welcome to do. Kenobi guessed that Romin's leader wanted to keep tabs on them; it was better, after all, that Teda thought he had the Slams under his thumb."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Teda, excusing himself due to what he claimed was a busy schedule, introduced the Slams to his 'charity deputy' Hansel, who in reality was Teda's bribe collector. In making his 'invitation' to contribute to a slew of Romin charities (including one for children and one for horticulture) in order to \"fully extend the great steps of progression,\" the Jedi, of course, rightly guessed Hansel's true purpose. Quieting with a nudge Siri's sarcasm and insolence, which he knew would get them nowhere, Obi-Wan discreetly pulled from his robes a small bag stuffed with credits and handed it to Hansel, stating that he hoped it would help fill the needs of Romin's children. Hansel thanked them for their great generosity and offered them transport to their villa, but 'Slam' asked if they might instead stroll to their lodgings due to their long journey and need for exercise, to which the 'charity deputy' agreed, giving them directions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Strolling then to the villa, Ferus Olin immediately expressed his disgust that the children of Romin would never see the fortune in credits they'd just paid to a crook. \"Not to mention the plants,\" Anakin said wryly. Ferus reacted defensively, now that Anakin thought it a joke, but Skywalker tried to placate by pointing out that they all knew beforehand that it was the only way to remain on Romin, to which Olin curtly replied that while he didn't question their collective decision, he didn't have to like it, either. Obi-Wan thought about intervening when he heard their bickering, but then decided not to, thinking it best that Anakin and Ferus work out their mutual dislike on their own. Moreover, Kenobi sympathized with Anakin about Olin's nerve-wearing self-righteousness. Paying the bribe had been necessary, and it was useless to regret it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With a day already gone because of travel, the Jedi had only two standard days left to complete their mission. They decided that they needed to immediately begin to reconnoiter Zan Arbor's house. But first, and before settling into their own villa for the night, they would do a quick survey of its security. As they approached Zan Arbor's residence, they slowed down a bit to see without looking\u2014a Jedi technique by which, while appearing to be low-profile and casual, they expertly \"ticked off\" every security measure they perceived a target-facility to have. Which, in Zan Arbor's case, was \"the usual and then some\"\u2014security towers, armed windows and doors, infrared night sensors, rooftop surveillance droids, plus random invisible energy fences on the grounds. By any measure, Zan Arbor's villa would be tough to break into. And so, Kenobi suggested that they instead take the easy way, by simply walking in the front door."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Tempting the temptress"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi villa was modest in comparison to the rest of the neighborhood, but still luxurious by any standard of mission quarters the Jedi had ever had before. Still, this \"paradise\" remained an empty one, for only the wealthy could afford it, with the world's workers living in misery outside its walls. How could anyone enjoy the luxury, knowing that? Siri wondered. Anakin and Ferus were tasked next with basic reconnaissance of the city while Obi-Wan and Siri paid a visit to Zan Arbor to gather information. The Padawans were to talk with people, observe security, traffic patterns, and escape routes, but also to remain alert in a more general way with no specific objective in mind, to gather whatever useful information they could that might pay off later."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Precisely as had been his instinct, Kenobi simply announced at Zan Arbor's front entrance that Slam and Valadon wished to see her, and she immediately granted them audience (egomaniacal evil scientists and master thieves apparently needed no introduction). A tall, hulking Phlog bodyguard escorted them to a reception room overlooking the villa's gardens. Wearing a silver gown with azure belt, Zan Arbor sat elegantly to receive them\u2014it was obvious she consulted the best medical data in the galaxy to maintain her well-preserved appearance. For while Kenobi had changed much in the 18 years since he'd seen her (Obi-Wan was taller, older, more 'galaxy wise,' perhaps more rueful and sad), she looked almost unchanged."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zan Arbor let the pair know that their reputation had preceded them, for she had been so informed by Teda and eager to make their acquaintance. She poured them tea as they sat before her in two ornate chairs. Elegant furnishings surrounded them in the beautifully appointed room. Zan Arbor didn't seem to approve, in some odd way, for Valadon's attire, which included her bare legs and gold boots. When asked why they'd come, Kenobi stated that while it went without saying that they wished to meet \"the finest scientific mind in the galaxy,\" they also confessed to having come to tempt her with an offer. Zan Arbor assured them that she was now retired, but to continue anyway with what they had to say. When Obi-Wan suggested that she join the Slams in an extremely lucrative venture involving a planetary treasury, promising her no risk and absolute anonymity in return for her help to briefly incapacitate the guards through air delivery of her new drug so that they might raid said treasury, Zan Arbor declined. All her needs were already filled, she said. Kenobi countered by suggesting that needs were not necessarily wants, and that she perhaps yet held onto some secret ambition. But what the Slams were offering, in her mind, fell short\u2014it was not enough to tempt her, she said. Still, she wished them luck and accepted their friendship as new neighbors. Referring to their little visit together as having been \"lovely,\" Zan Arbor announced abruptly that her Phlog bodyguard Hue would show them out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "But once Zan Arbor had gone from the room, Siri, at Obi-Wan's prompting, put on her charms in earnest to distract the Phlog and lead him further into the villa and coax him to give her a tour (taking her Jedi companion quite by surprise, as he'd never seen her charms taken to quite the same level before). Meanwhile, Kenobi reached out with the Force to investigate what he'd noticed earlier: Zan Arbor's exquisite cabinetry concealed something, due to the way the joinery at the hinges and the openings looked to him. He wished his Padawan, with his amazing connection to the Force, was with him: Anakin's ability, refined by his training with Soara Antana, in working with inanimate objects and being able to judge the space between molecules as well as the objects the molecules made up, never ceased to amaze Obi-Wan. Kenobi\u2014knowing that Zan Arbor was driven by greed and ego and had no intention of retiring, as she'd led them to believe\u2014knew by his clear instinct that she was planning something. She had made a lucid reference to those plans by her words, \"There is what I can imagine, and what actually lies ahead\"\u2014meaning that Slam's small-time plans were puny compared to hers, and for that reason she'd dismissed them as not being worth her time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Suddenly, feeling through the invisible seam and catch, Kenobi came upon the hidden compartment he hoped was there\u2014a concealed office, actually, with datapad, holofiles, comlinks. Quickly accessing the datapad, for he knew he had only moments, he found, to his relief, that not all of the files were coded. Remembering his and his Padawan's recent 'latest tech' techniques training with the Temple's resident tech expert, Jedi Master Toma Hi'llani, he accessed Zan Arbor's most recently consulted holofile. He read snatches: safe houses arranged ... officials to bribe have been contacted ... a start date must be decided on with care ... everything depends ... He inserted the file into his own datapad and copied it, with only seconds to spare, as unmistakable sounds emanated from the hallway announcing that the Phlog was determinedly returning to the reception area with Siri in tow. At last taking their leave of Hue, the two Jedi escaped into the sunlight. Warning him that their last Slams-impersonation escapade better have been worth it, Siri was encouraged when Obi-Wan confirmed that it was: Zan Arbor definitely was up to something, and he would try to crack her work disk-copy coded files back at the villa."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Thieves for the Resistance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In their reconnaissance assignment, Skywalker and Olin, having finished with the rich part of the capital, focused now on its scruffier business section. They noticed almost immediately the stark contrast between the poverty of the workers and the grand palaces in Teda's section of the city. And they weren't even outside the city yet. Anakin, in particular, was disturbed, his heart swelling with disgust for the injustices he was seeing\u2014identical in so many ways to the overwhelming injustice he'd witnessed as a slaveboy on Tatooine. Outside the city walls, surely the conditions were even worse. Anakin had to concentrate to keep his breathing even, for he tasted the injustice in his mouth like the sand that filled the air of his own native planet: \"The hatred he felt was bred in his bones.\" When Anakin mentioned the intimate understanding he shared with the wretched people they beheld, Ferus nodded, saying, \"Yes, you do. That is your great strength, Anakin.\" The comment took Skywalker by surprise, as he'd always thought of it as his weakness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Just as the two were about to approach Cloudflower Wall to observe security checkpoints and escape routes, in case they were suddenly cut off from their ship, Anakin felt a surge in the Force, a warning, as a shadow seemed to pass over him: they were being followed, and they jointly agreed to lead the tracker on, then double back to see who it was. Picking up their pace, they weaved in and out of shadows, eventually darting into a dark alley where they used cable launchers to scale a warehouse wall and observe who was tailing them. Moments later, they jumped down to the street below, directly in front of a cautiously moving Romin\u2014it was Hansel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Obviously startled, Hansel explained that he hadn't expected to have to follow members of the Slam gang here. They'd been sight-seeing, the two advised him. With clearly better sights to be seen, theirs was a curious choice, Hansel said. They'd gotten lost, they explained, then quickly asked what they might do for Hansel. The charity deputy's task was to deliver, on behalf of \"Great Leader Teda,\" an invitation to Slam and Valadon (and, of course, the two of them, also) to attend a reception the following night for \"many like yourselves.\" Teda especially wished for Valadon to be there. The two 'gang members' accepted Hansel's invitation with pleasure, and the dictator's \"first aide\" took his leave to inform Teda of their reply. Anakin and Ferus felt that Hansel now suspected something, but just didn't know what. It didn't matter anyway, for they'd be gone by the time he figured it out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they hadn't received from their Masters a clear objective exactly, Ferus and Anakin decided to head back to their villa. But as they turned and began walking, the Force surged again\u2014too late. Caught up in their belief that it was Hansel who'd tailed them, they'd let their guard down. Their attackers assailed them from behind on airspeeders, using cables to knock the two off their feet, then throwing black hoods over their heads and tying them tight. Knowing they had to maintain their cover as Slam gang members, neither withdrew his lightsaber, but instead allowed himself to get captured: they might find out more information that way, after all\u2014especially who kidnapped them, and why. Their obscure objective had suddenly become clear to them as both were shoved into a vehicle and taken away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon, the black hoods were wrenched off their heads and they both took in deep breaths of air\u2014dank and murky, however, far from fresh. A deep voice broke the silence, encouraging them to take in the \"wholesome country air of Teda Estates.\" A bright light shone in their eyes, though the rest of the delapidated room was in shadows. When the deep-voiced being saw them tense in anticipation of a blow or a fight, he told them to relax, for neither he nor those with him wanted to hurt them, but, rather, to hire them. Apologizing that he couldn't issue nice personal invitations the way their Great Leader could, a tall, slender Romin emerged from the shadows, where several others of his kind waited. He told his captives that his proposition demanded privacy\u2014hence the manner he was compelled to use to arrange their meeting."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Introducing himself as Joylin, he was the leader of the Citizens' Resistance, whose stealthy operatives and compatriots\u2014many of whom lived within the boundaries of the capital\u2014remained behind him in the darkness to obscure their identities, for he was not willing to compromise their safety. The resistance group had been informed of the Slam gang's arrival and were eager to employ its expert thieves in their imminent revolt against Teda's regime, which they hoped would be \"bloodless.\" Events had coalesced, at last, to coincide with the ideal chance for a successful revolution\u2014a big reception that Teda was hosting at his grand palace for the wealthy criminals he had agreed to harbor on his planet. Joylin was desperate, therefore, to employ the Slam gang's \"special skills.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Joylin's rationale for choosing the gang members for his purposes was that they were new to Romin, without ties, friends, loyalties, or any need to betray anyone in order to help his revolutionaries.

Joylin was good at concealment, which was likely a way of life for him, but Anakin could feel his hunger, could sense Joylin's urgency, and the fear and anxiety beneath that urgency, knowing that the Slams could be the resistance leader's last chance. He therefore pressed Joylin for more information: while not asking him to reveal his secrets or compromise the safety of his agents, the Slams did need him to trust them if they were going to trust him and take a risk for him.

He admired Anakin's ability to make friends, to make connections with beings, which he lacked (for though all the students liked and admired Ferus, none offered him their intimate friendship, as Tru Veld and Darra Thel-Tanis had to Anakin). Ferus was always welcome at every eating table, but he was never invited to any particular one; everyone was Olin's friend, but no one was his particular friend.

His heart went out to him. Ferus would, Obi-Wan told the young man, find friendship later in life.

With power so great, Anakin thought his judgment to be equal to it. Whenever Anakin perceived something to be right, he therefore had to do it. Skywalker argued without truly hearing the counter-argument. He believed he could change not only situations, but beings as well.

Before she could stop him, Teda had foolishly offered that the man she spoke of was \"the most powerful business power in the galaxy.\" But time was of the essence and they needed to get off-planet immediately."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi stalled by mentioning to Teda Joylin's ultimatum wherein he threatened to execute the tyrant's loyalists, beginning with Hansel, should he not surrender. Teda briefly feigned regret for Hansel, but then sought confirmation that the ship's fuel levels were indeed full, for they were bound for the Core, for Coruscant. Snapping at Teda to be silent, Zan Arbor asked 'Slam' who his text-doc expert was, to which he was compelled to answer, 'Waldo.' Turning towards Anakin, who, notwithstanding his mask, felt entirely exposed, Zan Arbor recognized that she knew the young man from somewhere. Siri, to draw her attention away, interrupted by stating they'd gotten permission to leave from Joylin, who'd just closed down the spaceport. But suddenly there was comotion outside, and the real Slam gang burst into the courtyard, crying out to the Jedi, \"Impostors!\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Smiling, Zan Arbor returned her gaze to Anakin and declared her recognition of him as a Jedi, from their last encounter on Vanqor, complimenting him on his disguise, but reminding him, as a longtime student of the Force, that it wasn't a Jedi's face that beings remembered, but the Jedi's manner, power, movement. She had since asked about him and now knew him to be Anakin Skywalker, the Chosen One, whose destiny happened to be his burden also. Never had she expected such a prize. But Zan Arbor promised him something also\u2014a return to the Zone of Self-Containment, in which Anakin might see all of his burdens disappear. Anakin remembered the supreme feeling of contentment without a tether to sadness or guilt, but also the absolute serenity, once promised to him but never achieved as a Jedi. It was perhaps a serenity that he would never achieve. But the young Jedi, tearing off his mask, would not be tempted, and, despite her lush, appreciative, inviting smile, he spurned her overtures. Once, Anakin could now see, before evil had twisted her, she had been seductive. But that day was past."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Zan Arbor's interrogation, Obi-Wan had shot Anakin a look that told him not to engage in a fight, but to wait, as the stakes were too high and they needed more information. Teda suggested the four Jedi be taken to a prison and executed. Uncomfortable at the suggestion, the real Slam said they'd be satisfied simply with the impostors' cessation of impersonating them, plus a return of their clothes, added the real Valadon. But Zan Arbor realized what they now had\u2014leverage. With a great prize to bring to their partner, they could now negotiate a different, far more advantageous split. Looking back at Anakin, she told the young Jedi that he reminded her of someone she knew long ago. \"Qui-Gon Jinn,\" came the answer, but it was from Obi-Wan. Whirling about, Zan Arbor asked if she knew the impostor underneath Slam's attire. \"Obi-Wan Kenobi,\" he replied. Laughing in utter delight, she echoed his name enthusiastically: he'd only been a boy when they last met, and, appraising him, she told Kenobi he'd grown up well. Catching up on old history, she said she'd caught wind that Qui-Gon died on Naboo, that Yaddle had recently 'joined the Force.' Shaking her head, she asked: \"It makes you think, doesn't it? What is happening to the Jedi? Their strength diminishing, their best leaders struck down. And yet they don't see that they are declining. Such a pity to watch. So intriguing to study.\" Siri, who never sparred with villains, was not amused. Her eyes flashed, but she remained silent, with Anakin marking and admiring her utter confidence that she'd prevail against this villain in the end: he would cherish the current image of her ire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Turning to the real criminal gang, Zan Arbor offered refreshment and the same gig their impostors had already accepted on their behalf. Slam responded, realizing what it meant, with how happy he was that Zan Arbor's messengers had found him. Looking pointedly at the authentic gang members, Zan Arbor then gave warning to the Jedi of complete compliance to her direction, or lives would be endangered beyond their own. She commanded the Jedi to relinquish their lightsabers and called in all of Teda's army, including General Yubicon and many who rode on swoops, to escort the trespassers to a planetary prison. Their lightsabers were to be placed in the prison's vault for Zan Arbor's later study while the Jedi were to be placed under 'severe guard' in holding cells. The general, who stuffed the Jedi weapons into his back satchel, was not to let the Jedi out of his sight, nor listen to them. She and her new allies would pick them up when their preparations were finished at the safe-house site. Anakin could see that both general and tyrant were firmly under Zan Arbor's thumb, that she was truly the one in charge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi were roughly herded onto a rutted road running through the thickly wooded forest that blotted out the sun. The Jedi played along, waiting for the moment they knew would be theirs. When both Kenobi and his Padawan had called upon the Force, to tune out noise and focus in on Yubicon in conversation with his aide, they discovered that Zan Arbor's imminent grand scheme with Omega involved having the Senate to do their bidding. Arriving soon at the prison\u2014a dark green duracrete building, long and low\u2014the Jedi passed through the energy gates and into the compound. With energy cages suspended from the ceiling, it stank of dirt and rot, of desperation and pain. Windowless, its walls and floors were stained with dark matter. Kenobi looked at his Padawan, communicating telepathically, Not yet, but soon. Proceeding through a second door, beyond an energy fence, they came into an enormous cell stuffed with beings from many worlds, barefoot and in rags. Their faces were full of hatred for the guards, and even for the new prisoners that stood to be 'broken in'. Anakin was relieved when his Master said, Now."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The four Jedi leaped into action as one against the more than twenty army officers and prison droids in sight. More droids doubtless awaited in the inner rooms beyond. While the three male Jedi dealt with the guards, Siri whirled and kicked General Yubicon in the chest, knocking him backward and out, when his head hit the duracrete floor. Retrieving their lightsabers from his satchel, Siri tossed them to the Jedi. Some guards fled when they saw their commanding general incapacitated. The prisoners roared their approval in the background as the Jedi advanced through the rest of the officers and droids. They also gave Anakin advance warning when they yelled, \"Stun nets!\" With launchers in hand, more guards entered to release electrically charged nets. The prisoner warning gave Anakin the split-second he needed to call on the Force (using the techniques learned from Master Antana) to flip the paralyzing nets back onto the guards before they blanketed the room. The prisoners again sent up an approving roar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Suddenly, however, laser artillery from outside the prison caused its walls to glow red: the army had arrived to put a final end to the uprising. With a thundering crash, the entire entry wall came crashing down, exposing the prison to the woods beyond. An entire battalion was poised before the prison occupants, ready to attack. Upon being ordered to surrender, Obi-Wan leapt to deactivate the energy gates, releasing the prisoners, who, grabbing up blaster rifles and stun batons from the fallen guards, rushed out to do battle with the army. They yelled for the Jedi to give them a chance to fight, but Kenobi advised these unlikely allies that the Jedi hadn't freed them just to see them slaughtered by grenade mortars and missile tubes. Their faces grim, Obi-Wan could see they wouldn't be stopped. With his Padawan enthusing that they could win, he bid Anakin to take Ferus, find the weapons room, and bring back what they found; within minutes they'd come upon blaster rifles, more stun-net launchers, stun batons, and even a flamethrower, which Anakin himself swept up as the prisoners crowded in to snatch their own weapons. The young Jedi, with stun nets also in hand, returned\u2014whereupon Ferus, asking for Jedi cover, jumped onto one of the army swoops and, with astonishing speed, launched the nets out over the front lines, felling the soldiers and confusing those in the ranks behind them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attacking army's captain to whom the disoriented soldiers now looked was diverted, however, by brush fires ignited by the electrical charges. The resultant smoke swept over the army, choking them, as they strove to extinguish the flames. \"Now!\" Obi-Wan directed the prisoners, who surged forward with a mighty shout. While the Jedi thus succeeded in disorienting Teda's army, they hadn't yet vanquished them. But leading the charge, they deflected the mortar and blaster fire that pounded around them and Force-pushed troops away. Though Anakin thrilled with a feeling of certain victory, Obi-Wan could see there were too few Jedi and too many weapons coming against them. But suddenly, a sleek Republic cruiser appeared in the sky, swiftly dropping to a perfect landing; few Jedi could land a ship like that, Anakin knew, for he was one of them\u2014another was Obi-Wan's old comrade, Garen Muln. Sure enough, Master Mace Windu, Bant Eerin, and Muln came charging down the lowered ramp, their lightsabers blazing as they moved through the troops. The Force was powerful now in the collective Jedi's union of concentration and warrior strength. The tide of battle turned, and they soundly defeated the enemy, strategically targeting weaponry, separating divisions, and knocking out leaders who tried to regroup. Sighs of relief were heard when, after the Romin army commander, faced personally by the Jedi, laid down his weapon and surrendered, his forces followed suit."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Surrender to democracy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Garen couldn't resist telling Obi-Wan that rescuing him was becoming a habit, while his dear Mon Calamari friend Bant gave him a shy smile, saying she was just along for the ride.

This was done, that Obi-Wan might feel Bant's gentle presence in his life; seeing her, of course, was even better. Mace Windu, getting right to business, interrupted the reunions to get a status report from the Jedi, which included Joylin's imminent executions. Upon hearing this, Mace advised that their first task should be to impress upon Teda the necessity of his surrender."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was after Mace himself had circumvented Zan Arbor and Teda's escape by driving his lightsaber into the engine of their over-stuffed airspeeder before they could take off (doubtless to escape with the Slams on their ship) that he declared to them that his Senate-sanctioned presence on the planet was to negotiate the terms of Teda's surrender. When both criminals told Mace that they would do as they wished, Windu countered firmly that they would do as they were told: they'd be escorted to the headquarters of the new Romin government. When Teda balked, asking if negotiating with thieves and murderers was what the Senate was sanctioning these days, Windu thundered back that the Senate supported the people's revolt based on a tyrant's many crimes against his own citizens, and that Teda should consider himself lucky that the Jedi were there to ensure he didn't get torn limb from limb."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ultimately, both Hansel's execution and Joylin's own brand of dictatorial severity were stopped only by the intervention of Mace Windu, who, with the other Jedi, escorted the criminals back to Eliior. When they encountered Joylin, he was sitting with his closest advisors and allies, eating a large meal in the grand palatial dining area, now part of the new governmental headquarters. Pushing away his food, Joylin greeted Teda with hateful disdain, accusing him of typical cowardice by not returning by choice, only by coercion. For his part, Teda protested that Joylin was feasting upon the tyrant's food, an inaccuracy Joylin was quick to rectify by proclaiming it to be the food of the citizens of Romin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Windu, by Senate authority, advised Joylin that no executions could take place, that trials must be held and evidence gathered to prosecute properly. For even the Citizens' Resistance couldn't begin a new government using the tactics of the one it had overthrown.

As Senate support was crucial to building their new world, Ferus Olin spoke up, and because the Citizens' Resistance had already accomplished so much, their vision deserved the best chance to flourish. Joylin\u2014suddenly jarred from his state of staid fury, as if stirred from a troubled dream\u2014looked up at Olin, to agree, at last, with such sound reasoning, especially now that Teda was in custody. The planned executions were stopped.

Olin modestly admitted there was simply a bit of pride mixed in with Joylin's politics. Wanting her Padawan to more fully appreciate his contribution to the mission, Siri lightly added that Ferus showed a greater grasp of the situation than the other Jedi did, for he predicted a chaotic takeover, said that Joylin would surprise the Jedi\u2014he was absolutely right. Kenobi noted, alternately, that his Padawan looked unhappy.

Skywalker suddenly discovered that, beyond objects, he could manipulate beings also, use their fears and secrets. This was a facet of the Force he had not known before. Anakin abruptly told Joylin what the power-seizing leader already knew\u2014that he had, in truth, let Teda go freely. The Jedi, completely surprised, turned to Skywalker. The guards were not taking Teda to Prison, Anakin revealed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In fact, Joylin had orchestrated a ruse of his own. The revolutionary leader had depended on Teda's cowardice not to surrender, so that Joylin himself might proceed unfettered to execute all of the dictator's loyal followers who threatened the new ruler's power base\u2014as a precaution, to utterly prevent the possibility that they might grow strong again. He never needed Teda dead because, as a mere figurehead, Teda never posed a real threat. Joylin only needed Teda gone. And so, by accepting, just as the revolt began, a bribe from Zan Arbor to permit the escape of Teda and herself offworld, Joylin had effectively accomplished that riddance. Anakin revealed all of this to Joylin: and the revolutionary's guilt on every count was, by his silence, obvious to the stunned Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Teda clearly, now, was being taken to join with Zan Arbor at the landing platform, to escape with the Slams on their star yacht.

Ascending the turbolift, they hid behind an equipment-laden gravsled, from which position they could see the Slams readying for departure. Mace congratulated Anakin on his excellent work in bringing this new information to light, and was about to lead them all in a charge toward the criminals, when Kenobi bade them wait. He advised that they should let the criminals go. This was the chance they'd sought to let Zan Arbor lead them to Granta Omega. It would be their only way to find him. They'd have him in their grasp if they could get a tracking device aboard the vessel. When Mace Windu objected to the risk of letting get away this formidable danger to the galaxy, Obi-Wan assured him, and all of them, that Omega was the bigger threat, intimating moreover that their new direction, to go after Omega, was the will of the Force. To which Siri, her eyes blazing blue, agreed: the rightness of their course was clear. She and her Padawan were ready to join them on this new mission, she told Mace.

All on board the Slam's yacht had to be distracted, in order for Anakin to seize his moment. He would use the Force, gathering it in, forming it to his pleasure, to what he needed. When the engines fired and he felt their heat, Anakin moved. The ship rose, hovering a meter above the ground, while the crew input coordinates and information, giving Anakin the few seconds he needed for time to slow, to spool out before him. He Force-jumped straight into the exhaust, which obscured him from the viewscreens. Despite its blazing hot temperatures\u2014too hot for a living being to stand\u2014yet he stood it, and it failed to burn him. There, at the edge of the platform, Anakin timed the move with the ship's rise, flinging the tracking device at the yacht's underside, where it connected.

Looking up at the ship's vapor trail, Kenobi confirmed to Windu that they were now ready to track the Jedi arch-villain, explaining that\u2014as Omega had always seemed to be one step ahead of them in the past and had always planned their meetings\u2014for once, Obi-Wan now would decide how they'd next meet.
