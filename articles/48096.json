Headquartered in the Odik system, the Fifth Deep Core Army was one the GAR's six Reserve Sector Armies, and it was initially assigned to garrison the Deep Core. However, much of the Sector Army was transferred to other, more active regions to support other Galactic Republic forces early in the war, and the 5th maintained only a skeleton force within the Deep Core. Sometime prior to the founding of the Galactic Empire, the Republic's successor state, on 19 BBY (16:5:23), the Republic issued the Sector Governance Decree, which gave twenty Moffs command over one of the Sector Armies; the Fifth was given to Moff Gann. Gann was later elevated to Grand Moff, and he remained in power until at least 17 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Fifth Deep Core Army was first mentioned in The Essential Guide to Warfare, a 2012 reference guide, which gave overviews of the twenty Sector Armies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
