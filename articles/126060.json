It housed the ancient Throne of the Sith, which the Dark Lord of the Sith offered to both Kylo Ren and Rey, two promising successors. Opposite to the throne was an amphitheater that could hold hundreds of Sith cultists. Between these two structures laid a wide space upon which Darth Sidious' Sovereign Protectors stood guard. Suffering from deteriorating flesh, Sidious relied on the Ommin harness for mobility inside the throne room, where the Sith was confronted by Rey and the redeemed Ben Solo during the Battle of Exegol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith Citadel throne room appears in the 2019 film Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, the third installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
