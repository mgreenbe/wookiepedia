Unscrewing a flare stick would activate the chemicals stored within. The reaction of those chemicals resulted in the emanation of a bright glow from the flare stick. A flare stick could be deactivated and saved for later use by screwing the two ends back together."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
