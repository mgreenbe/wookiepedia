At some point, she tried to talk to Norra about life. Norra, however, ignored her mother and did the complete opposite. Shortly after capturing Imperial Vice Admiral Perwin Gedde, Norra was about to have a similar talk with her son Temmin before realizing that she had hated it when her mother gave her the same kind of talks and noted that like she had done, Temmin would do the complete opposite of what she told him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
