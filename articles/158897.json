From it's name it can be assumed that its purpose was to register immigrants from other planets that did not have a permanent residence. Around 1 BBY, the Vagabond Registration Office was responsible for taking the details of Illyan Webble, a vagrant that had traveled to the planet from Kalkovak. The office recorded when Webble eventually stole a skiff and piloted it out into the middle of one of Mon Calamari's oceans. When the bounty hunters Zuckuss and 4-LOM arrived on Mon Calamari, they visited the office to pinpoint the location of Webble."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
