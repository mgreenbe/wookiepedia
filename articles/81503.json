Lhunu opposed some of the policies of the Infinite Empire and worked to atone for the Esh-kha's crimes. One of his goals was getting aid in freeing Hallow Voice and his followers, though he believed that they were too dangerous to be allowed for their freedom. While the galaxy-wide struggled to succeed, the Rakata transported Hallow Voice, along with thousands of the Esh-kha, to Belsavis.
