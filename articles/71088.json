She grew up on Marn's Orphan farm. Marn ensured that Jinby and the other children had food and water, sent them to the Phirmist temple and sent them to work in the hemmel fields. There, Jinby would till the hemmel fields, using a hemmel reaper. From when they were young, Jinby told her friend Mattis Banz stories about the heroes of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, like Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa and Gial Ackbar, at nighttime and while working in the hemmel fields. Jinby's stories inspired Mattis to become a hero by protecting younger orphans from bullies, and later by joining the Resistance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like Mattis, Jinby defended other orphans from bullies. In one incident, she stood up to a Saurian boy named Fikk, who held a Sol Charless, a smaller Snivvian boy, upside down and threatened to drop him into the farming instrument known as the Splitter. Although Fikk was mean and much stronger, Jinby warned him to let Sol go and tried to pull him over. When Mattis intervened by driving into Fikk with a Hemmel reaper and chasing him off, Jinby used her quick reflexes to catch Sol."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jinby was a trusted friend to Mattis. When they were ten years old, Mattis told Jinby his suspicions that his parents were heroes of the Rebellion and that they would return for him someday, after he became a hero of the New Republic. She didn't agree that things would happen how Mattis pictured, but later conceded to be nice. Jinby was the only person to whom Mattis ever confided this story. Mattis had a crush on Jinby, but he resisted the feelings and they remained only friends."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jinby had a studious personality and valued logic, reason and math. She believed stories were a way to learn about the world and considered them lessons on how to be a good person. Jinby was kind and made efforts to take care of the other orphans. One way she did this was by holding Mattis Banz's hand at night and telling him stories so he would not feel alone and afraid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jinby first appeared in flashbacks in Ben Acker and Ben Blacker's 2017 children's book Join the Resistance.
