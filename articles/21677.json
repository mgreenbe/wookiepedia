During the Clone Wars, he produced at least two propaganda pieces for the Republic's unity communications campaign, the first of which was a poster titled \"Jedi Unite for Peace\" that never saw distribution due to the suggestion by Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine that the Jedi Order not be used in propaganda due to the Jedi's discomfort at taking on the role of military leaders in the war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His second piece was entitled \"Unite,\" and as part of a collaboration between COMPOR and the Republic War Office, replaced the Jedi with the clone troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic in order to bolster moral. Following the Republic's reformation into the Galactic Empire at the end of the war, Doubton became an instructor in the Commission for the Preservation of the New Order's Sub-Adult Group and eventually retired to his family estate back on Eriadu."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Byno Doubton was first mentioned in the reference book Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released on October 25, 2016."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
