Although a hermaphrodite like all Hutts, Bochaba had a masculine personality. He gained notoriety when he took possession of an HK-series assassin droid with the designation HK-47. Bochaba installed several programs to improve the performance of the droid and used its assassination protocols to kill three hundred twenty-two sentient beings, the Hutt's competitors, in a single year. These successful eliminations made Bochaba very wealthy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the Exchange crime syndicate opposed Bochaba and had the Hutt killed in a grizzly fashion in retaliation.
