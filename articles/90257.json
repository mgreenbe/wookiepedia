After the destruction of Alderaan by the Galactic Empire, three members of the family remained in their apartment while Stormtroopers arrested other residents of their neighbourhood, with the eldest child of the family, Anandra Milon keeping her little brother Santigo Milon away from the apartment windows while their mother cried, at first on an orange couch and then in her bedroom. The father of the family was not home at this time as he was away on a trade mission. The two children later escaped the apartment in the bucket of a cleaning droid when Stormtroopers arrived to arrest the occupants. Their mother remained behind and opened the door to the troopers. The apartment was located next door to another apartment, which was owned by a droid mechanic, who was friends with the Milon family."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Milon family apartment was first mentioned in \"One Thousand Levels Down\", a short story written by Alexander Freed and published in Star Wars Insider 151 in 2014."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
