However, Maarek Stele, who was then an above average TIE pilot picked up the shuttle on his scanners while engaging X-wings. He managed to get close and inspected it to find Rebel Officers. Once that was done, he was contacted by the Priest informing him that Assault Gunboats are being dispatched. The Gunboats engaged the Scutz launching Concussion missiles which drained the shields and disabled it with their Ion cannons. Once the shuttle was disabled and immobile Delta-class DX-9 stormtrooper transports Epsilon 1 proceeded to board and capture it. The Shuttle then departed from the area entering Hyperspace to an unknown location."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Scutz features in the 1994 PC game Star Wars: TIE Fighter and its Prima Strategy Guides.
