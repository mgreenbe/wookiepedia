McCool's true name was a series of whistles which was incomprehensible to most non-Kitonaks. He was from the planet Kirdo III, and played a flute made from a hollow chidinkalu plant from his home planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life and Sy Snootles"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was unclear how Droopy left Kirdo III, but he reached Orvax IV with a slaver company. A melancholic Kitonak, he longed for the companionship of others of his species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was on Orvax IV that Droopy, under the name Snit, was bought by Evar Orbus. Orbus was the lead voice of a music group, Evar Orbus and His Galactic Jizz-Wailers, also featuring Max Rebo and Sy Snootles. However, Orbus would rather say that he \"hired\" Snit instead of buying him. Snit's belly was big enough to hide his legs, and partner Rebo was envious of what he considered a great feeding."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Snootles was fond of Snit. Due to the Kitonak's natural patience, Snit could listen to the singer's complaints and thoughts for hours without saying a word, and then he would gently soothe her pains and fears. Snootles believed that it was Snit who kept the group together."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Orbus got a contract with Chalmun to play music in his cantina, on Tatooine. He led the group to Tatooine, but they were met by Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes, and a fight broke out between the two bands. Orbus confronted the attackers and died in the attempt, while the rest of the group ran away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Then, Snit declared that he was unsatisfied with his name and wanted a stage name. Snootles wanted to help him, until Snit chose a new name in Kitonese that even her vocal apparatus could not reproduce. She convinced him to accept the stage name she made up, \"Droopy McCool.\" His stage name was fitting, referring to his \"cool\" personality."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Max Rebo Band and Jabba's palace"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The group was re-named the Max Rebo Band, now only under Rebo's wing. This new incarnation was discovered by Jabba Desilijic Tiure's talent scout and former majordomo, who got them an audition with Jabba himself. Jabba was impressed with the Rebo Band and offered Rebo a life contract in exchange of all the food they could eat. Rebo accepted before Snootles could stop him. \"Droopy\" did not have a chance to say anything either, but he considered that it was a bad deal; he ate once a month and they had a load of chooba slugs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During their first night at Jabba's Palace, a Gamorrean guard noticed that McCool was a Kitonak and mentioned that he had seen other Kitonaks on the Dune Sea. He left before Droopy said anything, but this idle chat gave him something to think about."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"McCool\" was famous because he never fit in with the crowd, and because he had a quasi-mystic behavior. However, as the other courtiers on Jabba's Palace were usually busy, almost nobody paid him any attention as long as he continued with his work. He only seemed to speak with Sy Snootles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Droopy McCool was in Jabba's Palace, almost performing, when Boushh appeared with Chewbacca on 4 ABY. However, his behavior at this moment was not perceived by any of the witnesses."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Droopy went with the Rebo Band on Jabba's sail barge to the Great Pit of Carkoon, and soon a large fight developed between Jabba's thugs and his victims. It was on this battle that Jabba died, ending thus the Rebo Band contract. The sail barge was suddenly unstable and the band was afraid. They did not help Jabba's minions against his enemies, although Rebo and Snootles argued about pros and cons of leaving the barge (Rebo was afraid of losing such a good contract as they had had). McCool and Snootles jumped without a second thought, and Rebo was pushed from the barge because of an accident."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They were recovering in the sand, where Snootles explained that she had a contract with Lady Valarian in mind. However, Droopy was uninterested. He was said to be hearing \"his brothers\", other Kitonaks on the Dune Sea. Rebo heard nothing and was skeptical about that, but could not convince Snit. The Kitonak left for the desert to not be seen again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years later, some old moisture farmers said that they had heard chindinkalu flutes during the night, in the darkest corners of the desert, and others believed that it may have been Droopy and his pals playing music while waiting for the Cosmic Egg."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Droopy McCool was portrayed by Deep Roy, uncredited, in Return of the Jedi. New footage of McCool was filmed for Special Edition of Return of the Jedi, however it is unclear if it was Deep Roy again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character was referred to as \"Der Droopy\" in some early material, including a Return of the Jedi coloring book, and unused molds for Pepperidge Farm's Star Wars Cookies from 1983."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Ambiguously-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
