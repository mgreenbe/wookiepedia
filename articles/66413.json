This system emitted energy signatures capable of briefly disrupting defensive energy fields. Field disruptors were usually worn on a belt or backpack. When activated, a disruptive energy field was generated around the user, allowing the user to penetrate basic energy shields. The field disruptor also found use as a secondary weapon as the energy field would also deliver a painful discharge to anyone who touched the user."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
