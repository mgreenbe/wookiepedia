A7-E3PO tried to act as a voice of reason within the Foundation and the protocol droid opposed the radical philosophies of the CZ-series droid T-215, which encouraged droids to rebel against their masters. A7-E3PO traveled the galaxy, spreading the beliefs of the Droid Rights Foundation as it went, and it often visited courts, corporate headquarters and the Galactic Senate, lobbying on the Foundation's behalf. A7-E3PO was reprogrammed by Jolor Oron, the leader of the Foundation, to exhibit utmost loyalty towards the organization, and it was aware that Oron secretly planned to bring about the destruction of all droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
