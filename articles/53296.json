Captain Bung made several runs to the world, shipping the popular snack food known as Bantha Breakfast Biscuits aboard his starship, the Chubby Gundark, after realizing that there were many worlds that had no access to the snack. Importing them from the planet Sullust, Bung made several hundred thousand credits over a two week period.
