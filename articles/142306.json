As an Imperial defector, Thane, recently promoted to commander, was placed in charge of a boarding party that was tasked with capturing the Imperial Star Destroyer Inflictor for the New Republic, whose nascent starfleet faced a critical shortage of ships. Using their knowledge of Imperial ship design and procedures, the New Republic forces boarded the Inflictor. Thane's knowledge of Star Destroyers came to good use when the strike team successfully disabled the ship's engines and self-destruct system. Unknown to Thane, his lover Ciena Ree was the captain of the Inflictor during that assault. After receiving confirmation that the Inflictor was on a crashing course, New Republic pilot Iden Versio overheard on her comms that they were sending a recovery team to extract Kyrell and the boarding party."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the fighting, Thane recognized the voice of Ciena Ree being played throughout the vessel on the intercoms, calling for the evacuation of all Imperial personnel within the designated time limits to prevent the Inflictor from being captured by the Republic forces. Telling the rest of his crew to abandon the ship, he headed to the bridge, which Ciena had sealed off. Remembering the quote Ciena used to show her deceased sister beautiful or surprising moments in her life, \"Look through my eyes,\" he cracked the password and entered the bridge. Although Ciena's oath required her to see the ship destroyed, he tried to take her with him, and the two fought.

Although Ciena had remained loyal to the Empire, she could see its faults and wished that her oath no longer stood. She thought that the New Republic would make an example out of her, torturing and executing her, but Thane assured her that even if she didn't give up any intelligence, the Republic did not treat its prisoners of war that way and were very lenient. He remained confident in the goodness and fairness of the Republic, vowing to wait for her as long as it took so they could be together.

His older brother Dalven regularly bullied and belittled him. While he got on slightly better with his mother Ganaire, he did not receive much love and affection from his family.
