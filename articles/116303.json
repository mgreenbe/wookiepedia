Roan although a Civilized himself supported The Workers in the revolution, and became close friend to the Worker's hero Ewane, whom was elected as Supreme Governor at the end of the revolution. After Ewane was killed, Roan was elected as ruler of the planet, and took in Ewane's twin daughters Eritha and Alani. Many at the time thought that it was Roan who had Ewane killed, but the murder was done by a guard of Ewane named Balog. The twins were captured during Roan's leadership and Roan was killed while he tried to save them. As it turned out, the kidnap was staged by the twins so they and their associate Balog could kill Roan - a step in their plan to take over the reigns of power in New Apsolon. Roan was succeeded as Supreme Governor by his brother Manex."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
