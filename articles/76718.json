In 12 ABY they were captured along with Luke Skywalker, his companions, their rival clan, the Gakfedds and indoctrinated onboard the Imperial battlemoon, Eye of Palpatine. Their indoctrination was almost successful; the Klaggs learned to speak Basic and were turned into relatively good Stormtroopers. They constantly considered the Gakfedd's to be Rebels, and fought each other consistently. When they were evacuated from the battlemoon, they refused reorientation and negotiated with Drost Elegin to be taken on as bodyguards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Members"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
