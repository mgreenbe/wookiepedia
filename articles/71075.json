Realizing that TIE fighter pilots were nothing more than cannon fodder, he decided to steal an advanced TIE fighter from the hangar bay and sell it on the black market. Unfortunately, he was discovered attempting the theft even before he had entered the bay. Desperate, he blasted his way to the nearest spaceship and made off with it. That ship was an impounded tramp freighter named the Beggar's Solace. A skilled TIE fighter pilot, Jin-Jin managed to evade the TIE fighters that pursued him as he was escaping Carida into space. Bad luck struck again, and the ship's hyperdrive motivator set off prematurely and sent him off on a wild ride through hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A trail of unfortunate events"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jin-Jin was forced into selling many parts of the Solace to recoup his losses.
