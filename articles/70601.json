He served as pilot of the Alderaanian CR70 corvette Tantive III and the CR90 corvette Tantive IV, vessels belonging to the family. Both corvettes were commanded by Captain Raymus Antilles and were used by Bail Organa, Viceroy of Alderaan and Senator for the world in the Galactic Senate of the Galactic Republic. In 19 BBY, the Tantive III was on the Republic's capital world of Coruscant during the events of Order 66, in which the forces of the Republic turned on their allies in the Jedi Order. Keen to help some of the surviving Jedi, Organa had the Tantive III leave Coruscant in order to rescue Grand Master Yoda and Master Obi-Wan Kenobi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon returning to Coruscant, Organa and the two Jedi were in the vessel's cockpit with Colton and his co-pilot when a message from the office of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine reached the ship. Colton informed Organa of the message and, on the viceroy's orders, patched through Vice Chair Mas Amedda, who informed Organa of a special session being held in the Senate. Once the message ended, Organa and the Jedi discussed the possibility of the session being a trap but decided that it was likely authentic. As such, it presented a good opportunity for the Jedi to infiltrate the fallen Jedi Temple and alter a beacon being used to lure Jedi to their deaths. Colton then piloted the Tantive III to the Galactic Senate Building so that Organa could attend the session. After the session and the Jedi's successful mission, the Tantive III left Coruscant again and carried Organa and Yoda to the Polis Massa asteroid field."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Colton was a light-skinned human male with blond hair and blue eyes.

The character's name is not spoken in the film, but his surname is given in the credits along with his rank. \"Jeremoch,\" a portmanteau of Bulloch's name, was first mentioned as Colton's first name in the new Star Wars canon in \"Job Done\", an article in the \"Building the Galaxy\" department of the 2018 magazine Star Wars: Build Your Own R2-D2 99. Bulloch had previously portrayed bounty hunter Boba Fett in the 1980 film Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back and the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Colton's scene in the film was added during pickups filmed on F Stage at Shepperton Studios on Tuesday, August 31, 2004, although director George Lucas had decided to have Bulloch cameo in the film long before that. Wishing for Bulloch to be more than just a \"mysterious conundrum,\" Lucas claimed that he and others had been looking for somewhere to put the actor and decided Colton's role was the best place for him. Bulloch received the offer for the role from producer Rick McCallum while on holiday in Italy, at first thinking the phone call was a joke as few people had his telephone number. He was astonished when offered the small role, and found it odd returning to Star Wars as a different character, and has joked that it would fun if Boba Fett was revealed to actually be Colton underneath his mask."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Origins"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Star Wars Legends continuity, a Captain Colton was first mentioned in the 1976 novelization of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, which was written by Alan Dean Foster. In the novel, C-3PO claims that he and R2-D2's last master was a Captain Colton. The 1984 reference book A Guide to the Star Wars Universe by Raymond L. Velasco clarified that the Colton mentioned in the novelization was simply a misnaming of Raymus Antilles, although the 1995 reference book The Essential Guide to Characters by Andy Mangels then mentioned Colton and Antilles as separate characters. Jeremoch was then established as the first name of the definitively separate Colton introduced in Revenge of the Sith by \"Refresher Reading,\" an article written by Pablo Hidalgo and published in Star Wars Insider 90 on September 25, 2006."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
