All Ugors and all visitors to the Paradise system were expected to adhere to the tenets of Divine Law. This compliance was enforced by armed Ugor battle-wagons. Ugor Holy Officers were the arbiters of the law. One of Ugorian Divine Law's precepts held that when an Ugor touched an unclaimed object, the slime of its pseudopod both made the object holy and marked it as the Ugor's property."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
