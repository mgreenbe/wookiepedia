Measuring roughly thirty light-years across, the Void had no planetary systems and very little debris. The Marcol Void separated the Imperial controlled region of the sector, centered around Kal'Shebbol, from the independent Kathol Outback. Ships with a Class One hyperdrive took fourteen days to cross the Void, and pirates would often blind-jump into the region since there was virtually no chance of hitting anything."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 8 ABY, Moff Kentor Sarne crossed the Marcol Void on his way to Kathol with his fleet.
