In both of these reference guides, Tish was listed as a level 16 captain of the Royal Naboo Security Forces, and as a denizen of Naboo. The Total Experience guide listed Captain Tish as carbineer and pikeman, while the Complete Guide simply listed Tish's primary weapon as a carbine, without making any mention of pikeman skills. Despite being listed in these reference guides, Tish is not definitively known to have appeared on the video game's live servers as a proper non-player character. The reference guides do not elaborate on Tish's species or gender, nor any quests Tish may have been associated with. Nevertheless, an emulated depiction pulled from this character's Interchange File Format reveals what he would have looked like if he were added to the game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
