When Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs managed the kitchen at Maz Kanata's castle on the planet Takodana, he employed numerous droids until an incident where a pair became homicidal. Many of the droids contained recipe databases, and Tuggs acquired a recipe from one of the old droids for cookies that originated in the Cavaell system. Sometime following the Battle of Takodana in 34 ABY, Tuggs included the recipe in his cookbook, The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cavaellin Spice Creams were introduced to the new Star Wars canon in the 2019 recipe book Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge: The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook, written by Marc Sumerak and Chelsea Monroe-Cassel. The out-of-universe ingredients for the cookies are butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, egg, molasses, baking soda, ground cinnamon, ground ginger, five-spice powder, and all-purpose flour. The filling is made with cream cheese, desert pear syrup or orange extract, powdered sugar, and heavy cream."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cavaellin spiced creams originated in the Star Wars Legends continuity, where they were first mentioned in Galladinium's Fantastic Technology, a 1995 roleplaying supplement to Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game.
