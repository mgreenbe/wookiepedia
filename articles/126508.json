It had been enroute to deliver a range of exotic animals, many of which were illegal to privately own, to Regent Solculvis of the Mol'leaj system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Members of the Sector Rangers captured the ship and catalogued the creatures they discovered on board, which included a Tralusian styanax, a sycanid, an Arkanian polar drake, worrts and a dwarf rathtar. As Solculvis's regency was independent of the New Republic and had a poor relationship with them, ships found enroute to him, such as the Sketter's Quarrel, were subject to the transit laws of their origin port. Information from the rangers' file on the case was later published in Scum and Villainy: Case Files on the Galaxy's Most Notorious, a book authored by Police Commissioner Exantor Divo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sketter's Quarrel was first mentioned in the 2018 reference book Star Wars: Scum and Villainy: Case Files on the Galaxy's Most Notorious, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
