Infil'a specialized in combat during his time as an active member of the Jedi Order. At some point in his career as a Jedi he chose to take the Barash Vow which forbade him from interacting with the Jedi Order as a form of penance. Because he was not an active member of the Jedi Order during Order 66, Infil'a escaped execution. Some time later, he faced the Sith Lord Darth Vader wielding a green lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Infil'a put up a fierce fight against Vader, almost killing him by throwing the Sith Lord off of a cliff. Despite severe damage to his suit, Vader survived the fall, and repaired himself with parts from Infil'a's droid, Arex. During their final confrontation, security personnel of the city fired at the two, making Vader force push them off a cliff, but Infil'a saved them. Vader exploited Infil'a's compassion for innocents again by flooding the city nearby, and, while Infil'a was trying to stop the flood, Vader pulled Infil'a's lightsaber from his belt, and, after a brief exchange of words, with Infil'a pleading with Vader to take his life, but spare the innocent citizens, Vader snapped the Jedi's neck with the Force, killing him. He then sent Infil'a's body to the depths of the newly-created lake, to join the city's innocent citizens in an eternal sleep."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life and Barash Vow"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kirak Infil'a had the rank of Master in the Jedi Order. While he was active with them, he came to believe that his only purpose was to fight. Sometime later, he took the Barash Vow, where he cut himself from the Order's activities. He took it to live alone inside the Force until his true path as a Jedi became clear. To do this, he relocated to the Jedi monastery on the river moon of Al'doleem. There he continued to train with the monastery's Jedi training droid Arex."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 BBY, the Jedi Order was almost completely wiped out. During the disaster, Infil'a felt the deaths of most the Jedi existing. The Order's end was orchestrated by the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and many of their deaths were at the hands of his Sith apprentice, Darth Vader. Shortly after, Sidious sent Vader to obtain a Jedi's kyber crystal and bleed it. Vader sought out Jedi who had taken the Barash Vow as they were easier to find at that time. When his droid searched the archives of an abandoned Jedi spacestation, he learned of Infil'a and sought out to hunt him down for his lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Confrontation with Darth Vader"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Vader approached the moon, Infil'a was having a training session with Arex. He fought the droid whilst constructing four Padawan's traps at once, much to Arex's objection. Infil'a then sensed Vader's approach and told Arex to prepare the mountains defenses. As Vader approached on his starship, Infil'a used the Padawan's traps to bring it down. Vader managed to save the ship and then walked to Infil'a's mountain, where Infil'a raised a wall to block his path. He faced the Sith from the top of the mountain and asked if it was him that killed the Jedi. Vader responded by Force choking him, but he quickly broke free and Force pushed Vader away. In a further exchange of words, Vader confirmed that he killed the Jedi and that he was coming for Infil'a too. Infil'a then declared his barash Vow complete and told Vader that he would wait for him at the top of the mountain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As he exited his confrontation with Vader, he had Arex open the sluice gate. The gate released a lake-full of water down on Vader, submerging the Sith. Though visibly damaged by the sudden flood, Vader parted the water with the Force and climbed to the opposite shore. As he then continued his advance, Infil'a had a flock of Raptorans attack him. Vader began besting the birds and Infil'a studied him, inquiring what he was. Vader managed to use the Force to kill numerous Raptorans, but one of his cybernetic legs was badly damaged in the fight. Infil'a then had the birds withdraw and told Arex to turn the rest of the traps off, giving Vader a clear path to them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Vader approached the two at the top of the hill, he threw rocks at Infil'a, throwing him back. Arex confronted Vader with his energy sword but Vader used the Force to pull the droid to him and rip his arm off, obtaining the weapon for himself. Vader then threw what was left of Arex over the cliff and faced Infil'a. Infil'a deduced that Vader was there for something and as the two clashed, he concluded that Vader was there for his lightsaber. The two fought ferociously and Infil'a insulted Vader's skill. He told him that he could not have killed that many Jedi alone and realized that Vader must have had a master. Almost immediately afterwards, Vader's previously damaged leg broke apart, rendering him unable to continue the fight. Infil'a then informed Vader that he would rid the galaxy of the two Sith Lords and restore light to the Force. Infil'a then blasted Vader off the cliff, sending him plummeting towards the ground below."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Final duel"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Assuming Vader was dead, Infil'a traveled to Am'balaar City, where his Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor was kept preserved in a garage. He approached the owner, Mareena and she uncovered the ship from under its covering. Mareena complied, but had to service the interceptor first due to its time tucked away. Infil'a explained his encounter with Mareena and began helping her with his ship. However, unbeknownst to Infil'a, Vader had survived his fall. He had landed on a rock near where Arex's remains, but the fall had badly damaged him. Once he had regained consciousness, he used the droid's parts to repair his broken mechanical leg, and his other damaged cybernetics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Vader finished his repairs, he traveled to Am'balaar City. There, Infil'a was still fixing up his ship and sensed his presence. He rushed outside to find Vader at the top of the city's dam. Mareena and her husband, Jogg, were confused and Infil'a told Mareena to keep working on his ship. He then jumped to the top of the dam and fought a second time with Vader. As Infil'a pushed Vader back with the force, the two were fired at by the Am'balaar City police. Vader Force choked them before throwing them off the side of the dam and Infil'a used the Force to rescue them. He then told Vader that he was a monster and Vader confirmed it before using the Force to breach one of the water tanks below. Infil'a used the Force to keep the water from drowning the citizens, but while he was distracted, Vader used the Force to take his lightsaber and Force choked him. Infil'a pleaded to let the people live, but the Sith used the Force to break more water tanks, further flooding the city. He then executed Infil'a and threw him into the flooded city."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After killing Infil'a, Vader took his lightsaber and bled the crystal on Mustafar.

However, Vader survived and soon came back to challenge him again. During their second fight in Am'balaar City, Infil'a became more fearful of Vader, especially when he targeted the Am'balaar City police officers and other citizens.
