The DPRA stated that any being capable of piloting a starship was free to seek out planets that had once been inhabitable, but had been damaged by Yuuzhan Vong terraforming. Having originally been deemed unusable, these planets later showed signs that life would slowly return to normal if they were left alone for as short a time as five years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the passage of the new law, the Reconstruction Authority was then charged with the task of overseeing these claims made by new explorers, and ensuring that proper credit was given for the discovery of new worlds. There were many that feared the Authority was being corrupted through funding by RePlanetHab, whom vied for preferential treatment when it came to claiming rights."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
