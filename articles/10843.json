It was constructed by the Galactic Empire and Trandoshan slave groups. The platform was built for anything but appearances, and it was crude, but functional, and was equipped with sufficient defenses to keep Rebels from interfering with the Imperial slave trade. As of 4 ABY, it was configured in a square, with the main reactor in the middle. Four airbases provided transports on and off the station. Military buildings protected the reactor. At one corner, there was an Imperial fortress; the corner diagonal to it held a slave pen protected by four laser turrets. A complement of stormtroopers and TIE fighters was also aboard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Avatar was frequently the last stop for a family before they were separated for shipment to their new masters. The slaver Pekt was instrumental in designing the station. During the Galactic Civil War the only way to obtain clearance codes to land on the platform was from the Blackscale Clan. However both the Zssik Clan of Trandoshan slavers and Imperial scientists on the planet Kashyyyk managed to acquire the codes to send operatives aboard the station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1 ABY, Wookiee freedom fighters attacked the Avatar Platform to stop the Trandoshan slaving operations. During these fights, a group of spacers working for the Zssik Clan entered the station to disrupt the Blackscale's slaving operations. After battling the Blackscale forces aboard the station, the spacers activated the station's self-destruct sequence and returned to Kashyyyk. The station was rocked by large explosions that caused much damage and killed most beings on the platform, but overall the station remained intact and quite functional. It didn't take long before both the Blackscale Clan and Wookiee freedom fighters sent reinforcements to the station to continue the fight for the control over the Avatar Platform."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Liberation of Kashyyyk in 4 ABY, Moff Hindane Darcc and Pekt were pursued by Han Solo and Chewbacca. When their palace was destroyed, Darcc and Pekt retreated to Avatar but were followed by their pursuers. Solo had already sent a message to the New Republic, and as soon as they arrived on Avatar, they were joined by Lando Calrissian on the Millennium Falcon and Rogue Squadron with Luke Skywalker. After a brief battle, the Rebels destroyed the airbases to prevent Darcc and Pekt from escaping, rescued Attichitcuk, who was enslaved with other Wookiees, and finally brought justice to Darcc and Pekt. Finally, the Rebels destroyed the main reactor, destabilizing the Avatar and causing it to crash onto Kashyyyk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Avatar Orbital Platform was first mentioned in the strategy guide for the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds.

However after the station's destruction in Rage of the Wookiees\u2014which takes place several years before the events of the Chewbacca campaign in Galactic Battlegrounds\u2014the non-player character Marium Valmont explains that the station wasn't fully destroyed and remained \"quite functional.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Galactic Battlegrounds, Avatar is an open, flat series of wide-walled platforms.
