Comprised of Klatooinian raiders and the AT-ST Raider, the tribe launched attacks on a remote village, killing villagers and robbing them. After the village hired The Mandalorian and Carasynthia Dune for protection. After a scouting mission, Djarin noted that he thought there were at least fifteen raiders. Later, a skirmish took place that resulted in the destruction of the AT-ST Raider and the deaths of several Klatooinian raiders, and ended with the tribe being repelled from the village."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
