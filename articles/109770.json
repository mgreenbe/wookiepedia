They stood between 1 and 1.5 meters at their shoulders, and had fur which ranged from snow-white to gray-streaked. They were known to attack their prey by pouncing on them and then biting. When they were starving, they were known to fight to the death to get a meal. The native Askhew were known to have tamed some quohr and used them to draw their sleds. Generally, a team of four to eight quohr would pull a single sled which was loaded down with a maximum of 200 kilograms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
