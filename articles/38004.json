They were regarded as potentially being the most beautiful beings in the known universe. When Anakin Skywalker first met his future wife Padm\u00e9 Amidala, he compared her appearance to that of an Angel. By 21 BBY during the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems had conquered Millius Prime, forcing the peaceful Diathim from their homes. Skywalker and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi would later meet an Angel during their mission to Iego, during which they liberated Iego and its moons by destroying the LaserWeb Defense Station left by the Separatists."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
