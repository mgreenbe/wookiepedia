However, Hera escaped and rejoined Lando and her rebel crew aboard the Ghost. An enraged Azmorigan pursued Calrissian and his rebel associates to Lothal and attempted to exact revenge on Calrissian.

Seeking to settle scores with both Hondo and Ezra, Azmorigan decided to use a loading dolly to fire them into space.

He owned a C-ROC Gozanti-class light cruiser called Merchant One and traveled as a treacherous marauder to find the richest pickings. He was served by several masked minions and was a known associate of the Devaronian crime lord Cikatro Vizago. In 4 BBY,[source?] Azmorigan did business with the galactic entrepreneur Lando Calrissian, trading him a puffer pig in return for the Twi'lek pilot Hera Syndulla.

During the battle, Azmorigan's henchmen were overwhelmed by the the crew of the Ghost with several being killed. At the height of the fighting, Azmorigan took the Lasat rebel Garazeb Orrelios hostage and offered to spare him if the rebels surrendered Calrissian. However, the astromech droid Chopper fired on him with the Ghost's turret cannon; knocking him to the ground. Now at the mercy of the rebels, Azmorigan accepted an ultimatum from Syndulla to leave Calrissian's compound.

The two gangsters arranged to rendezvous on the icy planet of Nixus. However, on the way, Vizago was incapacitated and imprisoned in his own ship the Broken Horn by the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka. Later, Ohnaka was joined by the rebels Ezra Bridger and Chopper, who had encountered Azmorigan during an earlier adventure with Calrissian. Upon arriving at Nixus, Azmorigan took Ohnaka and Ezra captive since he distrusted them showing up without Vizago; possibly intending to double cross Vizago originally if the opportunity presented itself. Azmorigan knew that the Rang Clan had placed a bounty on Ohnaka's head and recognized Ezra as part of the rebel group that had aided Calrissian."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Azmorigan ordered his men to load Ezra and Ohnaka into a loading dolly, where they would deposited into space.

Taking advantage of the confusion, Ezra broke free and used his lightsaber to shoot stun shots at the henchmen.

The Spectres, at the urging of Ezra, agreed to support Hondo's plan after learning about the presence of proton bombs on the container transport; something that the rebellion needed desperately. The rebels agreed to take the bombs while Hondo and Azmorigan agreed to divide the spoils from the treasures among themselves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to his overweight physique, Azmorigan struggled to climb down the stairs which led to the Ghost's cargo bay.

The rebels managed to leap onto the hull of the cargo ship and board it through a manhole. Inside, Azmorigan, Hondo, and the rebels encountered a furious Melch, who attacked Hondo for abandoning him.
