The species' elongated skulls added to their height. Muuns hairless heads featured small eyes over a long, shallow nose, often giving them nasally speech. Their small ears were also flat, and were found underneath their skullcap. Their thin arms were of normal length, featuring five-digit hands. The last two fingers of their hands were much shorter than the others. Underneath their slim waist were a pair of very long, thin legs. They were a very intelligent species, known to have incredible mathematical capabilities.
