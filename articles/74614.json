He was transported to a Trandoshan moon, Wasskah where he was to be hunted down for sport. He was dumped out of the HCT-2001 Dragonboat-class Reugeot 905 freighter at night and managed to survive the blaster fire from the Trandoshans. However, the next day, he met his fate when he, along with another prisoner Lika were walking along the island. Suddenly, one of the Trandoshan hunters named Ratter fired at them, killing Katt Mol. Lika tried to flee but was soon also killed by Ratter's partner, Sochek."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Katt Mol's outfit is inspired by the costume worn by Zutton (nicknamed Snaggletooth), another Snivvian, during the cantina sequence of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
