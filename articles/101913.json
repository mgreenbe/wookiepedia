As all underwater buildings conceived by the Gungan society, the cathedrals were hydrostatic bubbles grown from refined bubble wort. The bubble itself rested upon a tetrapod utanode assembly to which four smaller spheres were attached. The cathedrals were topped by a crown of three spiral swirls, and they also contained musical devices that emitted a distinctive metallic sound. Like the High Tower Boardroom, its inner layout featured a supplication platform, a crescent-shaped dais and a series of illuminator beacons. At least one such structure was built in New Otoh Gunga during the colonization effort of Ohma-D'un in 32 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Audio"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
