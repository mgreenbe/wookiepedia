He gave R2-D2 special rocket boosters but would change the navigation controls. QT-KT got a high-powered magnet that would attract anything magnetic but would be very harmful around mines, and U9-C4 was given a laser cutter which would cut through most objects but was very powerful and would knock the droid backward if not in locked position. Gubacher removed M5-BZ's memory to make room for Colonel Meebur Gascon to fit inside the droid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gubacher seemed to enjoy his work and was very happy when he did operations. He seemed to respect the droids' feelings, for when Meebur Gascon stated that the droids did not deserve sympathy because they were synthetic, Gubacher said that it was a good thing M5-BZ would not remember this comment when his memory got removed. Gubacher also seemed to be excited before removing M5-BZ's memory personally."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
