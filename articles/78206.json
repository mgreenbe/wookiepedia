This move was made even though the Kroctari were fairly well-armed for a planetary government, and were deep in New Republic territory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It is not known if the Kroctari decided to continue to be associated with the Imperial Remnant after the unmasking of the Thrawn imposter Flim at the Battle of Yaga Minor and the subsequent signing of the Pellaeon\u2013Gavrisom Treaty between the Imperial Remnant and the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
