It was used by the Techno Union to mutate male Nelvaanian warriors. These mutated warriors had a blaster grafted to their arm and some form of control device on their chest. These experiments were based around a siphon generator that drained thermal energy from the surrounding area, resulting in the endless winter experienced all over the planet. The base was destroyed by Anakin Skywalker, the Nelvaanian's prophesied Holt Kazed, who liberated the Nelvaanian warriors in the Battle of Nelvaan in 19 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
