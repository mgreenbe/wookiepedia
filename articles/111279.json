Mundi put all of his available funds into this shipment and two shipwrights, Tarth Jaxx and Io Tsomcren, were waiting for the shipment with impatience. Ral Mundi was afraid to not be able to pay back the shipwrights for the missing shipment, nor even be able to complete other projects. Ral Mundi's Starship Emporium was on the verge of ruin so Mundi requested the help of the Corellian Security Force. CorSec Lieutenant Mack Jasper sent a spacer  who worked with Ral Mundi and his assistant Abagga Creel to find information concerning the missing shipment. The spacer later discovered that the shipment was stolen by the Ragtags, with the help of Tomi Jinsin who was himself a Ragtag thug. The spacer retrieved the shipment in the Coronet Capitol, along with a crate of illegal spice. The retrieval of the missing shipment saved the company from bankrupt and Mundi was indeed very grateful. Further investigation of the CorSec about the shipment robbery and the smuggled spice would led to the discovery of a plot of the Rogue CorSec to overthrow the Diktat Daclif Gallamby himself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ral Mundi's Starship Emporium was a location in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
