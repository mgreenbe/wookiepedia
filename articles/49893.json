While all Jedi were taught to connect with the Force, and while most lightsaber styles relied on this connection to at least some degree, the Force forms enhanced a Jedi's power to feel and control the Force, allowing one to reach beyond what most could in the midst of combat, at the expense of physical ability. They were popular among Jedi Consulars and others who relied more on the Force than on lightsabers, even in battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around the time of the First Jedi Purge, there were four major Force forms:"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike lightsaber forms, the different Force forms only appear in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, and most of them only appear if the player follows the class of the Jedi Consular, Jedi Master, or Sith Lord. Even within the game itself, the Force forms seem to be an afterthought; they do not appear in the game manual alongside the lightsaber forms, and dialogue in the game will have a dark-sided Jedi Exile learn the Jedi Masters' \"lightsaber\" techniques, even if they are using Force forms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
