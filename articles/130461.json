He collaborated directly with MandalMotors on its design, and he purchased all production rights upon completion to ensure the ship would remain unique. Xizor's personal version of the ship featured a super-advanced targeting computer that greatly increased the performance of whatever weapons the ship happened to be using. Following Xizor's death, MandalMotors reacquired the production rights and released a StarViper variant less powerful than Virago to the open market. In addition, Mandal Hypernautics began producing the fighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "StarVipers formed the main starfighter force of the Zann Consortium, and they were modified to carry and deploy swarms of old Pistoeka sabotage droids that the Consortium obtained via the black market, proving superior to interceptors such as the RZ-1 A-wing interceptor and TIE/IN interceptor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These fighters were also employed in small numbers by the Mandalorian forces present on Mandalore during the Galactic Civil War.

The game version of Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire depicts the Outrider fighting off dozens of these fighters. Both of these instances are contradicted by the fact that the StarViper was limited to a single ship, the Virago, at the time.
