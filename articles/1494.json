During the Great Galactic War between the Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire, Lieutenant Elin Garza was given command of one of the 45th's platoons upon her promotion to lieutenant, and her platoon was shot down on Bomodon in 3673 BBY. Under her leadership, the platoon would fight a ten-month guerrilla campaign to ultimately liberate the planet from Imperial occupation, and the 45th Infantry would continue to serve the Republic Military until at least 3643 BBY, when it was stationed on Ord Mantell."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
