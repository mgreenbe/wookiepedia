The refit allowed the Hardcell-class to undertake a more direct combat role as it had improved attack range and created the ability to be outfitted with a variety of weaponry. During the Clone Wars, at least one such vessel participated in the Battle of Christophsis as part of CIS Admiral Trench's naval blockade. The ships had three laser cannons at the top of the craft and six engines grouped in three pairs of two. Following the military refitting of Hardcells, they continued to see plenty of combat during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
