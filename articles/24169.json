At some point the children's mother died, leaving Nurik to raise his children by himself. Nurik moved his family to the planet Dantooine in search of peace and safety, arriving shortly after Ahlan Matale had done the same with his family. The two men fell into a series of disputes with each other and developed a hostile relationship which they attempted to enforce on their children. However, their efforts were not entirely successful as Casus' sister Rahasia met with Ahlan's son Shen when they were alone and fell in love. Casus later met with Shen and the two began to form a friendship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Casus was an amateur archaeologist and worked on digs while on Dantooine around the time of the Jedi Civil War.

Before Casus reached the ruins, however, he was attacked by a pack of kath hounds\u2014vicious predatory animals\u2014and mauled to death. Unaware of Casus' fate, his father believed that his disappearance was the fault of the Matale family, and kidnapped Shen Matale in retaliation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Padawan Revan soon came across the archaeologist's body while investigating the disappearance of Shen Matale.
