It was designed to act as either a high-tech contact vessel or as a powerful assault vessel, successful in both roles. The Empire employed this craft to seek out new worlds and if necessary, deliver a devastating strike to them. Though it normally held three gunners, powerful computer-controlled weapons enabled the craft to inflict maximum destruction with minimal effort with a single pilot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Pacifier was equipped with some of the most powerful sensor arrays built in its era.
