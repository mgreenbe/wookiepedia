Sometime prior to 0 BBY, Rebel Alliance operatives were able to insert the Covallon spy D\u00e6lar vuv Tertarrnek into his household disguised as a loyal pet. Jarnek became very fond of his new pet and kept the rebel spy by his side unaware that his \"pet\" was secretly feeding vital information to the Rebels."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Months after the Battle of Endor, Jarnek went to the planet Spirador, where he owned a palace, and ensured his own personal security with a Star Destroyer planetary blockade and stormtroopers and armed security droids through the building, also keeping a blaster on a nearby table in his private rooms. However, Princess Leia Organa discovered her activities and sent Luke Skywalker on a mission to arrest Jarnek. Skywalker's lightsaber got rid of the droids. A broken droid interrupted Jarnek's leisure and scared the Moff but, before Jarnek could get his blaster, Skywalker entered his room. As Jarnek was not familiar with the introducer, Skywalker introduced himself when entering, then arrested Jarnek."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jarnek was a Human male who achieved success through a combination of hard work and ruthlessness.
