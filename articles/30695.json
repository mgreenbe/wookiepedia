Served on a trans-shipped medium-density foodboard, the slider was based around one Mongo Beefhead patty, served grilled, with the other ingredients settled around it. These items were a slice of Gonzo yellow cheese, some Revwien lettuce, topato slices, grilled Ojomian onions, and B'omarr-style pickles. Like all sliders served at his diner, the Coruscant slider came with Jettster's distinctive \"special sauce\" as a garnish. The meal cost 6.5, and for an additional charge of .5 a customer could have another meat patty with it. It could also be bought alongside another basic slider as a Talus and Tralus slider meal. A customer could request both Sernpidalian mayo-ketchup and Bimm mustard to go with the meal at no charge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Coruscant slider is mentioned in a Hyperspace-exclusive release, \"Dining at Dex's\" by Gregory Walker, which represents the in-universe menu of Dex's Diner."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
