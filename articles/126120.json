Bestowed upon Sith hopefuls who had shown some degree of facility with the Force or who had otherwise impressed a student, these medallions signified their preliminary acceptance into the Academy. In order to gain final approval, however, a hopeful had to first contact Yuthura Ban, the Twi'lek apprentice of Uthar Wynn, the Academy's Master, and convince her of their worthiness to attend. Once accepted, the device served as a pass to enter the Academy itself after having left."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
