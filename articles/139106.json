Tagoo and Jimba led the attack on the droids and overpowered them. With the droids captured, the Patitites called their leader, the Big Hay-Zu, to question him on what they should do with the droids. However, when the Big Hay-Zu was crushed to death by R2 by accident, Tagoo and the other Patitites cheered. Along with Jimba, Tagoo requested that C-3PO stay to be their new leader. He refused however, and instead helped them set up a democracy. The two droids left, leaving the Patitites to quarrel over future leadership."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tagoo was voiced by Matthew Wood in the episode \"Nomad Droids.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
