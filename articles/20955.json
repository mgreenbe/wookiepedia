It was a contemplative order seeking enlightenment from studying and worshipping art. Centuries prior to 22 BBY, the Brotherhood's Pontifex would regularly legalise marriages, a law that was still in order during the last decades of the Galactic Republic. The Pontifex Maxiron Agolerga legalised the marriage between Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Anakin Skywalker in 22 BBY, after the practice hasn't been performed in 300 years."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
