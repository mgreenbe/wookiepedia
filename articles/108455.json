Around 21 BBY, an effort to develop pseudonet encryption was underway at a secret base operated by the Metatheran Cartel trade alliance on the moon Tilnes and was regarded as the most important project underway at the facility. The Caarite technician Celis Bol was assigned to work on the pseudonet encryption project. After Bol was disciplined for spitting in the bean juice of the Cartel base's overseer Ko Bas, the technician was permitted to remain on the pseudonet encryption project and not re-assigned as a punishment, much to the Caarite's relief."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "18 days after the incident with the bean juice, a group of freelance agents ventured to the Cartel base and recovered Bol's log from the installation's computer, in which they noted a reference to pseudonet encryption. The agents were unfamiliar with pseudonet encryption and considered it to sound intriguing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pseudonet encryption was mentioned in in Caaried Away, a roleplaying released in March 2003 and written by Morrie Mullins. The adventure formed part of the Metatheran Caution trilogy of the Living Force campaign, a supplement to Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Roleplaying Game. In the adventure, the player characters roleplay as the freelance agents that travel to the Metatheran Cartel base on Tilnes and it is possible for them to discover a reference to pseudonet encryption within the facility's computer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
