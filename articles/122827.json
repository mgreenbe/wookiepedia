Originally a cramped garrison base, it grew to become a large complex of interconnected domes and hangars, with additional modules either prefabricated or assembled onsite, as well as an adjacent landing field and deflector shield generator. Because of its importance, it was usually protected by a flotilla consisting of numerous capital ships as well as smaller vessels, including the frigate Salliche, the tug Fremond, and the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Core Envoy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A prefabricated garrison base, the original modules for Sentinel Base were deployed by a Victory-class Star Destroyer in 21 BBY, during the galactic conflict known as the Clone Wars.
