She put the students through an exhaustive course that was designed to test them to their physical limits. Regular activities included soccer, dodgeball and stretching."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Students sometimes had trouble understanding her, as she spoke only in Shyriiwook. Roan also made comics trying to understand what Kitmum would often say. She also chaperoned on a field trip to the planet Kashyyyk and translated for the students, but that just meant she growled, too. Roan said, \"At least we had her as a guide to show us around,\" because Kashyyyk was Kitmum's homeworld. During the school's Satine Hawkins dance, she invited Mr. Garfield to dance, and he reluctantly accepted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
