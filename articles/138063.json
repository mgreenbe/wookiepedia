The corvette's crew, led by the Jedi Master Qu Rahn, was subsequently captured by the Dark Jedi Boc Aseca and brought before Sysco on the Star Destroyer's bridge. After an orderly informed the prisoners of the ship's military protocol, Sysco told Jerec that the prisoners were ready to be interrogated. Jerec approached them and demanded information on the whereabouts of the mythical Valley of the Jedi. However, the prisoners refused to answer any questions and all, save for Rahn, were subsequently executed by one of Jerec's Dark Jedi followers. Jerec used the Force to rip the information he sought from Rahn and then left the Jedi where he stood."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a last stand, Rahn telekinetically grabbed the lightsaber of the Dark Jedi Yun. After Rahn severed one of Aseca's tendons, Sysco drew his sidearm and attempted to shoot Rahn but was stopped by Jerec, who insisted that his followers needed the practice. Sysco holstered his weapon, only for Rahn to sever Jerec's minion Maw at the waist. Rahn's rampage was finally ended by Jerec himself, who beheaded the Jedi Master. As the crew looked on, Jerec ordered Sysco to clean up the bodies, set a course for the moon Sulon, and arrange a special dinner. Sysco agreed but first walked straight to his quarters\u2014carefully stepping over Maw's severed legs in the process\u2014to open a bottle of Bonadan booze, which he kept in the bottom drawer of his desk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Qu Rahn attacked Jerec's Dark Jedi, Sysco frowned at the Jedi's decision and attempted to attack on the behalf of the injured Boc Aseca.
