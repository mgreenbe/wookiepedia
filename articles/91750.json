While on Kafrene, Andor sought out a reliable intelligence source, Tivik. Tivik was waiting in a dead end and appeared especially anxious and nervous to Andor compared to previous encounters. Tivik informed Andor that an Imperial cargo pilot named Bodhi Rook had defected only a day before. Rook had been convinced by Galen Erso to seek out Saw Gerrera and his Partisans on Jedha, in order to pass on information to the Rebel Alliance regarding an imminent weapons test being scheduled by the Empire. This weapon, Tivik explained, was powered by Kyber crystals, and was strong enough to destroy planets."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Escape"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two stormtroopers approached Tivik and Andor in the dead end, asking for identification.
