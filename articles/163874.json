Utilizing supercooled gases and specialized engine nacelles designed to scatter escaping gas, the WhisperThrust was specifically designed as to leave as little sensor wake as possible, allowing for a virtually undetectable cruising speed through space. High speeds and sudden bursts from the engines were capable of being detected however, necessitating low to medium speeds for movement."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
