Originally designed for police units tasked with controlling riots, the PEP laser made use of a deuterium fluoride laser to incapacitate targets without causing serious, long-lasting injury. Effective against most medium-sized humanoids, the PEP laser emitted a loud shockwave of sound and light when discharged, capable of knocking an individual off of their feet and inflicting pain significant enough that further resistance would be almost physically impossible. Those familiar with the weapon noted that a shot from a PEP laser was similar to being struck with a flash-bang grenade and hit with several plastoid rounds in the chest at the same time. Victims of a PEP laser strike were subject to severe bruising at and around the point of impact. Despite their unique makeup, PEP laser rounds could be deflected by a lightsaber as easily as normal blaster bolts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Noting the usefulness the PEP laser would provide in capturing live prisoners of interest, the Galactic Republic chose to outfit the elite clone commandos of the Grand Army of the Republic's special forces with PEP laser attachments for their DC-17m blaster rifles during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The pulsed energy projectile laser was first introduced to the Star Wars universe in the Republic Commando novel Triple Zero, written by author Karen Traviss and published February 28, 2006.
