They were most commonly used for carrying ores like lommite. They traveled in convoys and were slave rigged to shepherd vessels to save the cost of hiring crew members and adding life support. During the Greater Seswenna raids many of the unprotected convoys were raided by Q'anah's Marauders until Outland Regions Security Force Commander Ranulph Tarkin came up with an idea to add a virus to the Container ship's navigation computer which would get onto the pirate ships and send them to new jump coordinates where the Outlands Security Fleet was waiting. With the threat gone, the container ships could continue without the threat of being attacked."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
