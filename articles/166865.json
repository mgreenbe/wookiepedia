They occupied the same ecological niche as the yobshrimp, another species of crustacean with whom they competed. The crabs could be distinguished by their blue shells and yellow eyes. They also possessed eight limbs similar to the legs of a Droideka battle droid, the front two of which were claws. Residing on the submerged swamp floors, the yobcrabs fed on fish such as daggerts, but were in turn eaten by Blarths. During the reign of the New Republic the zoologist Lyrre T'enna observed yobcrabs in their natural environment. The notes and sketches she made of the crustaceans were then included in her annotated field guide."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yobcrabs first appeared in 2001 in The Wildlife of Star Wars: A Field Guide, a reference book written by Terryl Whitlatch and Bob Carrau, with Whitlatch also providing illustrations.
