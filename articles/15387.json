At 2,500 meters in length, they were armed with 100 turreted medium turbolaser cannons, 100 anti-starfighter turbolasers, and three turreted concussion missile launcher banks. It also possessed a hangar bay capable of launching up to six squadrons of starfighters, and a squadron-and-a-half of bombers. It possessed more cargo space then the Bavos-I, making it much more self sufficient than its predecessor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
