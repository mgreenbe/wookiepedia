In the year 32 BBY, the inexperienced Toong podracing pilot Ben Quadinaros rented a hastily put together BT310 for use in the Boonta Eve Classic, an annual podrace hosted on the planet Tatooine by the Hutts to commemorate the Boonta Eve holiday. However, the quadra-Podracer suffered from an engine malfunction that caused it to stall on the starting grid. When its engines did ignite, the BT310's power couplings shorted out, causing them to break loose and blast off in all directions of Mos Espa Grand Arena, destroying the podracer. Despite this, Quadinaros continued piloting a BT30 and was depicted using one in The Sport's Greatest Rivalry, a poster pitting him against his arch-rival, Sebulba."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quadinaros piloted a BT310 during the 29th Annual Bricklayers' Classic on Tatooine; as he was about to win the race, its engines broke loose as a podracer piloted by Zander Freemaker collided with the quadra-Podracer, causing the Toong to lose."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The BT310 quadra-Podracer was created for the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.
