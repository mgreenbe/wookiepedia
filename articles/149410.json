After the informant Lilith Laughlin revealed to the CorSec that Trins Evnar was a member of the Council, Captain Vitala Baize hired a spacer to eliminate him. Her objective was to infiltrate the Chirq Council using Evnar's identity. The spacer thus fought Trins Evnar in his house and killed him. After his death, the spacer also eliminated every Chirq Council members who used to know Evnar in order to permit the infiltration mission, namely Seyda Shae, Genovin Jasha, Jade McDonagh and Kazic Pendre. The spacer later assumed Trins Evnar's identity towards the underboss Jzoro Quanera and managed to infiltrate the organization.
