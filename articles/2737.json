Qui-Gon Jinn sensed a disturbance in the Force, and Yoda asked why, just before Darth Maul and Darth Vader appeared. Vader was confused about his whereabouts, and Yoda told him to go because he was in the wrong movie. Obi-Wan Kenobi asked Qui-Gon if things could \"get any crazier,\" and Jar Jar Binks appeared, irritating Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon. Vader allied with Maul, but asked who they were fighting. Jar Jar tripped Yoda, who called Jar Jar a \"clumsy Gungan.\" Jar Jar singlehandedly subdued both Maul and Vader, the latter of whom apparently had no recollection of anyone else present. Yoda warned Jar Jar that he would zap him if the Gungan stepped on him again."}]}
