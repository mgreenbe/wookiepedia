The device was a large cylinder that spun on its gyroscopic axis and projected different images across the room that it was situated in. The holozoetroscope was highly valued, and so was often seen only in the most high class establishments on Coruscant. However, the Arcade Omicron cantina on Bescane had somehow acquired one of these as the centerpiece to its main halllway. During Operation Death-Hunter, the holozoetroscope present in this cantina was busy projecting an image of the Battle of Yavin, showing the Death Star I being destroyed while X-wing starfighters and TIE/LN starfighters fought around the giant space station. At the same time, the device was also projecting images of famous sculptures and noted works of arts across the establishment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
