By the time of the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire, Leisure Garden featured a number of holostatues that commemorated the heroes of the Jedi Civil War, the companions of the Jedi Knight Revan. During the Battle of Corellia, the Empire deployed a number of artillery pieces in Leisure Garden, and also sabotaged the holostatues. Republic forces eventually destroyed the artillery and restored the holostatues."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
