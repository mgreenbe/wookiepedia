It is unclear if or where the Rebel Alliance obtained the gravity well projectors destined for the Sagina and possible further Modified Strike Cruisers. Since the only encounter with the Sagina was during the attack on the shipyard where it left dock and fled, it is possible that the Sagina did not yet have functional gravity well projectors installed. The game database states \"Unique craft\" for the Modified Strike Cruiser entry, suggesting that the Peregrine was the only fully operational ship of this type ever built."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
