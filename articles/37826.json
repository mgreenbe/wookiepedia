Though few even knew of the planet Kamino, Jettster did from his days as a prospector on Subterrel and was able to identify the dart as originating from Kamino. Furthermore, he knew of the native inhabitants, the Kaminoans, who were cloners of some repute and kept to themselves but were welcoming to those who brought credits.

Unfortunately, not all of Jettster's clientele was trustworthy, as he was. Thieves sometimes stole nearby, so Jettster enlisted the help of his Jedi friend, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Kenobi and Jettster set up a sting in the diner itself to stop the robberies. When the thief, Tri Tellon, pickpocketed a trinket from Kenobi, Jettster and Kenobi tracked Tri to her hideout that she shared with another rogue, Magreda. Jettster now owed a favor to Kenobi, one that would be paid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was right before the Clone Wars began that Jettster was approached by Kenobi, who wanted to know if Jettster could identify a poison dart.
