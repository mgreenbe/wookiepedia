She learned strategy from the Lynna Zel Gris, whom Rinetta trusted and cared for deeply. Once, when the princess showed her instructor the royal treasury, Gris saw the Solstice Globe among the royal family's treasures. After Gris told her of the Globe's unique properties that could save her homeworld Livno III, Rinetta was convinced it must be returned and formulated a plan to help Gris steal it. Gris was caught while fleeing the planet, alongside Lando Calrissian, who was arrested for unrelated smuggling crimes. When Calrissian and L3-37 were ordered by Rinetta's mother to deliver the Solstice Globe to the Galactic Empire, Rinetta stowed away on Calrissian's ship, the Millennium Falcon, and attempted to convince the smuggler to bring the precious artifact to the planet Livno III instead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
