It is believed to have been provided by actor/singer Sheb Wooley."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Wilhelm's revival came from Star Wars sound designer Ben Burtt, who tracked down the original recording (which he found as a studio reel labeled \"Man being eaten by alligator\"). He named it after Wilhelm, a minor character who emitted the scream in the 1953 movie The Charge at Feather River. Its use in Star Wars was the beginning of something of an in-joke amongst some sound designers of the film industry, especially at Skywalker Sound."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In his endnotes for The Essential Guide to Warfare, Jason Fry hinted that the Wilhelm scream was uttered in the holodrama The Charge at Feather Nebula."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On February 22, 2018, sound editor Matthew Wood revealed that Lucasfilm has decided to not use the Wilhelm scream anymore following the release of Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens and instead replace it with a new stock sound effect."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Films"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "TV series"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Other media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-Star Wars media"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "See also"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wilhalm Skrim"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
