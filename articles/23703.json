He emigrated to the neighboring planet of Garos IV as a student, attending the University of Garos to conduct graduate work. Barzon remained on Garos IV, becoming a well-respected teaching professor and research scientist. In 19 BBY, Barzon began researching the ore hibridium. Only found on the western coastline of Garos IV's main continent, hibridium possessed natural cloaking properties. When the Galactic Empire established a presence on Garos IV around 5 BBY, Barzon joined the Committee of Seven for Garosian Unification, an anti-Imperial resistance movement. The professor feared that if the Empire obtained his research on hibridium, they would be able to fashion weapons capable of dominating the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
