It was commanded by Exarch Jom Vanten and protected by multiple Skytroopers and Knights of Zakuul. The Star Fortresses was looming over the three-way war between the Sith Empire, the Galactic Republic and the White Maw pirates over the salvage of Hoth. In 3631 BBY the Arcona historian Hemdil Tre teamed up with the Commander of the Anti-Zakuul Alliance to take down the Star Fortress. Together they assembled a strike team that assaulted and destroyed the Hoth shield bunker protecting the Star Fortress before regrouping on the Alliance base on Odessen. From there, Theron Shan and Miot Dengd assisted the Commander in infiltrating the Star Fortress. After fighting their way through multiple levels of the station, the Commander was able to reach the Sun Generator room and engage the Exarch directly. During the fierce fighting, safety features of the Sun Generator were disabled and Exarch Jom Vanten was killed. The Commander barely managed to escape on the shuttle before the Sun Generator overloaded, vaporizing the entire Star Fortress and all of its remaining personnel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hoth Star Fortress appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire as one of six Star Fortresses that can be assaulted and destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
