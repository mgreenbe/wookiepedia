While able to be tooled for the production of several vehicle types, the Empire most often produced the Self-Propelled Medium Artillery and 2-M Saber-class repulsor tank at these facilities. The Empire also attempted to use these facilities for constructing AT-AT walkers as well, but it was found the H-121 was too small and could not provide adequate attention for the advanced design."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
