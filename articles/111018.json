The Knight prevented the assassin from wiping out the colony, meanwhile, Watcher One\u2014who had returned to the Imperial Intelligence Outpost in the depths of a ruined complex known as Transport Station 5\u2014injected Godera with a truth serum and questioned him on his knowledge of superweapon design."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The raid"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After securing the colony, the Knight and a companion followed the coordinates for Godera's bioscan that the doctor's droid RE-M0 had given them, and they fought through the hostile rakghoul creatures that inhabited Transport Station 5 as they headed into the ruins. Unaware of the Knight's deal with Watcher One, the dozen Imperial operatives stationed at the facility attacked the Jedi upon sight. The Knight and the Jedi's companion dispatched the dozen Imperial snipers and scouts before heading into the outpost's main chamber, where Watcher One was reporting success to Angral via a holotransmission. Angral ordered Watcher One to bring Godera to the Empire's capital, Dromund Kaas, but when the Knight arrived, the Sith was enraged to learn that Watcher One had compromised with the Jedi. The furious Sith ordered Watcher One to capture the Jedi before ending the transmission, and the operative apologized to the Jedi for betraying their agreement before drawing his blaster. In the resultant battle, Watcher One was supported by two Imperial operatives, but they were eventually defeated by the Knight and the Jedi's companion; while his subordinates were killed, Watcher One was only injured."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stumbling backward, Watcher One questioned his opponent as to what would happen next.
