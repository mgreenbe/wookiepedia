The song was a political tune and mocked Darth Vader, a shadowy figure within the Galactic Empire. Just days after its release, approximately ten years before the Battle of Yavin, the Empire sent the entire group to the spice mines of Kessel, as \"Lord Vader has no sense of humor\" and declared the song contraband. As the life expectancy of those sent there was only one to two years, they were almost certainly dead by the time Kelen told Luke Skywalker of the song, which he had heard before on contraband channels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
