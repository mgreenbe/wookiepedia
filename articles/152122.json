Two of these beings were young students at Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum along with Anakin Solo and Tahiri Veila in 22 ABY. These students were able to lift their two-kilo weight with the Force, and buzzed happily, despite being weaker in the Force than Anakin, as the latter was initially unable to levitate the weight and wondered why they could and he could not."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
