The planet was host to members of the pacifistic New Mandalorian political faction, and even spawned a noble lineage from whence came the Duchess Satine Kryze and Prince Tal Merrik just prior to the Clone Wars.

Circling around the star system's sun, also known as Mandalore, Kalevala was a world blanketed in toxic desert. Following the rise of the New Mandalorian faction circa 738 BBY, Kalevala became home to a number of New Mandalorians, with recognized titles such as duchess and prince. On Kalevala, expensive wine and rich fabrics were produced. Quench-gourds grew on Kalevala, and at least one unique hairstyle evolved on the Outer Rim world.

The rise in Mandalore's militancy so soon after the devastating war with the Sith alarmed both the Republic and its Jedi protectors. Unwilling to suffer through a second Mandalorian War, the Jedi led a Republic strike force in a brief and targeted conflict with the Mandalorians in 738 BBY that brought devastation to the worlds of the Mandalore sector. Out of this disaster arose a pacifist sect calling themselves the New Mandalorians; the reformist political faction renounced violence and the warrior codes of the Mandalorians' past, instead preaching peace, neutrality, and tolerance. The New Mandalorians formed a new society separate from the Mandalorian warrior clans, in the white-sand deserts of Mandalore. At some point in the galaxy's history, the New Mandalorians also established a presence on the nearby world of Kalevala."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the late years of the Galactic Republic, Kalevala became the birthplace of Satine Kryze and Tal Merrik. Kryze later relocated to Mandalore, and though she had been born into the Mandalorian warrior clans, she chose to dedicate herself to peace and eventually became a duchess and the leader of the New Mandalorian people. Merrik was a prince, who came to represent Kalevala and the surrounding Mandalore system as a senator in the Republic senate. Kalevala's premier starship manufacturer, Kalevala Spaceworks, constructed Kryze's personal transport, the luxurious Coronet starliner. In 22 BBY, the first year of the galaxy-spanning Clone Wars between the Republic and the Separatist Confederacy of Independent Systems, Merrik was killed when it was revealed that he was in league with the Death Watch, a radically violent Mandalorian splinter faction returning to the galactic stage after years in hiding.
