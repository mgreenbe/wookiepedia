After previously killing a Jedi and their Padawan, Grievous came across the temple and attempted to claim the temple's secrets for himself. Following his experiences in the temple, where he was mocked by voices for what he had become and being small, Grievous ordered a Providence-class Dreadnought to destroy the temple.
