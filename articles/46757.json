He went through the Royal Naboo Security Forces' defenses and fended off attacks from Gian speeders to destroy a signal jammer. Once in front of the Theed Royal Palace, he used OX9 labor droids protected by droid starfighters to construct a Neimoidian Throne as a symbol of the Federation's victory.

Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala, her head of security Quarsh Panaka, several handmaidens, and Theed's governor Sio Bibble were all captured.
