The suits were pressurized, yet flexible and airtight due to the natural memory of the used materials. The user's natural senses are enhanced by integrated helmet optics and audio feeds. An aquasuit would provide six hours of atmosphere to an air breather. The suit also gives the wearer fresh water, nutrition supplements, and other biological necessities. Jedi at the Battle of Mon Cala like Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano, wore aquasuits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
