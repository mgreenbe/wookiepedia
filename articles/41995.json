He joined the Rebel Alliance and served as a deep cover mole for General Airen Cracken. As the Covallon rarely ventured into the galaxy, the Alliance was able to pass D\u00e6lar off as a non-sentient animal and had him given to Moff Harlov Jarnek as a pet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moff Jarnek took D\u00e6lar vuv Tertarrnek to his Palace on Spirador, where he ruled the Tandon sector. Janrek grew very fond of his loyal \"pet\" who seemed to instinctively know what Janrek wanted. D\u00e6lar achieved this responsiveness through his natural empathetic ability, common to all Covallon. The Moff brought D\u00e6lar everywhere with him, including to numerous high-security meetings. This allowed vuv Tertarrnek to gain information about fleet and troop movements, as well as learning top-priority access codes. D\u00e6lar related this information back to the Alliance via a tight-beam comlink hidden in his pen. This was relayed through a stealth probot stationed in the Spirador system. With this data, Alliance convoys were able to avoid Imperial entanglements in the sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While vuv Tertarrnek was extremely successful in extracting information from the Moff, there was one drawback from his position: as the Moff kept him so close by, his opportunities to relay information were infrequent.
