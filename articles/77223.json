The apostle was present in the Glory Room on the Sunulok for Lah when Executor Nom Anor returned from the planet Coruscant after addressing the New Republic's Senate. When Anor relayed the revelation that the young Jedi Jacen and Jaina Solo were twin siblings, Yabu pressed him to confirm it. Anor went on to ask how Yun-Txiin and Yun-Q'aah would view the death of only one twin. Initially, the Undying Flame apostle avoided the question, saying only that the Lover Gods did not demand sacrifice. When pressed by Lah, however, Yabu admitted that such an event would cause the Great Dance to become unstable."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kol Yabu first appeared in the 2001 novel The New Jedi Order: Star by Star, written by Troy Denning."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
