Placed on Outer Rim worlds such as Saleucami and Pantora, the posts were white buildings decorated with the Imperial crest. Manned by Imperial troopers, the stations were used for security at public spaceports, and Imperial citizens could register for identifying chain codes at the booths. The stations contained holoprojectors, which in the early Imperial Era were used to play a hologram recording of Vice Admiral Rampart explaining the benefits of signing up for chain codes, such as being able to exchange invalid Galactic Republic currency for new Imperial credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
