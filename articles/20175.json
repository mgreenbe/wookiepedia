On one occasion, Brawk's vessel stopped an Alliance ship carrying a venerable alien philosopher who had been trapped in cryofreeze aboard the lost science vessel Prana Lexander for nearly five hundred years. After boarding the Alliance vessel, Brawk noted this unregistered passenger and warned the Rebels that the penalty for such an infraction was seven years of hard labor. He quickly hinted to the Rebels that he was amenable to bribery. The Rebels gave him 2500 credits and he reported no violations to his superiors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
