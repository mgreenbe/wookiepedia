Master Kaim was stationed at the Coruscant Jedi Temple at this time, a skilled diplomat and an appointed instructor at the Temple's academy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Clone Wars erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Master Kaim remained on Coruscant to continue teaching at the academy. However, when Senator Meena Tills of Dac was taken hostage at the Galactic City Spaceport, Master Kaim was dispatched to negotiate the release of Senator Tills and other passengers of the transport the terrorists had taken. Working with Senate Head of Public Affairs Mar Rugeyan and Coruscant Security Force Captain Jaller Obrim, Kaim prepared to enter the area of the spaceport the hostage takers had occupied. Prepped by members of Omega Squad, Master Kaim agreed to plant a strip-cam somewhere in the room so the troopers could oversee the hostage crisis, leaving his lightsaber with them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Inside the chamber, Master Kaim confronted the Korunnai terrorists and attempted to persuade them into releasing Joz and Cira Larutur, an elderly couple from Garqi. The terrorists, noticing the active strip-cam soon after Kaim planted it, became enraged and shot Master Kaim point-blank in the face. In an act of terrorism, the Korunnai men strapped explosives to Kaim's desecrated body and tossed it back to the Republic forces stationed outside the terminal chamber. Before the bomb exploded, RC-8015 of Omega Squad threw himself over Kaim's body and the bomb, preventing any casualties. While Kaim's body was destroyed, the Commando was protected by his armor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
