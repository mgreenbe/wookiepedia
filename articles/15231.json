Approximately six months after the First Battle of Geonosis, Jedi Master Yoda arrived on the same planet and entered a small town carrying a large crate on his back. The citizens\u2014who did not take too kindly to strangers\u2014taunted the Jedi Master because of his unusual appearance, but Yoda did not respond. He put his crate on the ground and entered the nearby cantina, where he ordered himself a drink. The lone cantina patron recognized that Yoda was a Jedi, and explained to him the current state of events on the planet. Soon, one of the locals ran into the bar, warning of an approaching Separatist army. Upon hearing this, Yoda exited the cantina."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon, the Confederacy army\u2014consisting of a large number of B1-Series battle droids, B2 super battle droids, DSD1 dwarf spider droids and tracked tanks\u2014appeared at the outskirts of the town. The army's cyborg commander, riding on a gun platform, informed the citizens that the Confederate forces were going to \"confiscate\" their land and asked them not to attempt to rebel against the suppression. The commander then spotted Yoda standing near the crate and laughed at the idea of one Jedi fighting against an army. In response, Yoda pushed the red button on the side of his crate. The crate opened up, revealing a chaingun, and Yoda jumped to the controls of the weapon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At that moment, the Separatist commander ordered his troops to kill Yoda. Following this command, the droid army opened fire. Yoda opened fire as well, quickly decimating the entire army except for the commander. Yoda then stopped shooting, ignited his lightsaber, and jumped at the remaining Separatist, slicing his gun platform in half. Frightened, the commander ran away."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yoda chose not to pursue the cyborg, and deactivated his lightsaber. He then silently packed his chaingun back into the crate and left.
