Lurmen had two arms and legs with five digits on each hand and foot; each Lurmen also had a tail. Their bodies were entirely covered in brown or gray fur, over which they wore clothes. Some members of the species, such as Wag Too, had the ability to roll into a ball to travel at greater speeds. The Lurmen colonists on Maridun consumed raw jogan fruit for nutrition.

Complying to Tano, Kaa sent his son, Wag Too, to heal Skywalker. Kaa, however, demanded that a Jedi stay behind to ensure that Wag Too would not be taken. Agreeing, Secura remained with the Lurmen. When Tano and Wag Too returned to the camp, they found it was under attack by two mastiff phalones. Wag Too, not wanting to harm the animals, tied the creatures up and stopped Tano from killing them.
