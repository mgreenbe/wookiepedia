Centuries after the supposed destruction of the original Empire, a surviving faction of the Sith returned from the Unknown Regions and waged a massive war against the Republic. After decades of fighting, the Republic was overwhelmed and inundated both economically and militarily, while the Empire continued to gain ground. At what seemed to be the height of their campaign, the Sith surprised the galaxy and extended an offer of peace to the Republic. Although cautious of the Empire's intentions, the Galactic Senate of the Republic accepted the much-needed reprieve. Unbeknownst to the Republic, the Sith had no intention of allowing the war to come to a peaceful conclusion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Republic and Imperial delegations convened on Alderaan for treaty negotiations, the Imperial-employed Mandalorian Shae Vizla traveled to the Republic capital world of Coruscant and deactivated the planet's defense grid. This allowed for the Sith Lord Darth Malgus to enter the Jedi Temple alongside a group of fifty Sith Warriors and lay siege to the ancient edifice. The Warriors had a violent altercation with the Temple's Jedi defenders, led by Master Ven Zallow, but were victorious in their mission. With the Jedi defeated, a fleet of Sith warships under the command of the Lord Darth Angral descended upon the planet, bombarding the cityscape and deploying Imperial soldiers and warriors to the surface. Although the surviving members of the Jedi Order and the Republic Special Forces Division attempted to defend their capital, the Sith forces overwhelmed them. By the time the fighting had ended, the Jedi Temple had been reduced to rubble, six members of the Jedi High Council had been killed, and Lord Angral had assassinated the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic. All communications into and out of Coruscant were locked down, leaving the rest of the galaxy to guess at the carnage that was unfolding on the surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For two days, the Empire blockaded Coruscant and occupied the world, ruling it under martial law. The Coruscanti people were prohibited from leaving the world, and travel across planet was heavily restricted. Darth Angral became the provisional governor of Coruscant, while his subordinate, Darth Malgus, oversaw the orbital security. During this time, the Sith looted the world, executed Republic senators, and kidnapped a number of locals. On the second day of the occupation, renegade Jedi Knight Aryn Leneer targeted Malgus for his hand in the destruction of the Jedi Temple. Her hunt led to a number of breaches in the security of the Sith quarantine force, but the Imperial hold over Coruscant remained. It was estimated by both Sith and Jedi that the death toll lay somewhere between the tens of thousands and one hundred thousand."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Republic's capital securely in their grip, the Empire was able to take command of the negotiations on Alderaan. After the two-day long occupation and the destruction of much of Galactic City, the Republic delegation was forced to sign the controversial Treaty of Coruscant. Although it brought an end to the Great Galactic War and returned the capital to its original occupants, the treaty's highly biased mandates set the stage for the Cold War and forced the Republic into a debilitating position of weakness within the galaxy. As such, reconstruction of Coruscant was delayed and then drawn out for several years, with residents in the poorer areas of the planet being forced to make a living in the ruin left behind by the Sith. The planet's lower levels fell under gang control, and were largely ignored by the Republic government, which was headquartered on the very same world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A galaxy in flames"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the supposed defeat of the ancient Sith Empire during the Great Hyperspace War, the Galactic Republic believed the Sith to be extinct. However, unbeknownst to the galaxy at large, a faction of the original Sith had survived the destruction of the Empire and fled to the Unknown Regions, where they spent a millennium building a massive war machine to exact their revenge upon the Republic and its Jedi Order. Led by a Dark Lord of the Sith known only as the Sith Emperor, the Empire became a shadowy force of power prior to its return to galactic prominence in 3681 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That year, the Empire unleashed a massive onslaught against the Republic, igniting the Great Galactic War that eventually engulfed the entire galaxy. Although the fighting was initially contained to the Outer Rim Territories, far from the Republic's heart, the Emperor intended for his dominion to quickly defeat its enemy and become the preeminent galactic political body. Ultimately, the quick victory he expected would not be delivered, and the war dragged on for nearly three decades, exhausting both the Sith and the Republic. Once the Imperials had a secure hold on the outer regions, they pushed towards the Galactic Core, aided by the Mandalorian warrior clans. Led by Mandalore the Lesser, the warriors blockaded the Hydian Way in the last decade of the war, crippling the Republic economy and pushing some members of the Galactic Senate to call for surrender to the Empire. After the intervention of a rogue smuggling ring, the Mandalorian gambit failed and the war entered a stalemate, although the Empire had still been largely more successful in military endeavors than the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the failure of the blockade, Jedi victories at Alderaan and Rhen Var, and the repulsion of Imperial forces from the galaxy's Core Worlds, many on the Republic's capital world of Coruscant adopted the idyllic hope that the Jedi and the Republic Military would be able to keep Coruscant safe. Conversely, these defeats led the Emperor's Dark Council to seek a quick end to the war, and so they extended an offer of peace to the Republic Senate in 3653 BBY. The offer came as a complete surprise to the Republic, as it had appeared that the Empire was on the verge of victory in many combat theaters. While the Jedi High Council urged caution, the Senate accepted the offer, as the combined efforts of the Sith and Mandalorians had brought the Republic to its knees and ruined its economy. The Sith understood this fact and planned to exploit the Republic in the coming negotiations. It was decided that the Imperial delegation would require a trump card while deliberating with Republic and Jedi representatives, so plans were made for a massive assault on the Republic's capital, Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Preparing the endgame"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Plans for the invasion began as early as c. 3660 BBY, in the aftermath of the Rim Campaign. The Sith planned to take advantage of the thin spread of the Republic forces, which were primarily stationed in outlying systems along the Imperial border by order of Supreme Commander Rans. The Dark Council decided that the strike force was to be led by the prominent Sith Lord known as Darth Angral, while a smaller, secondary force led by the Sith Lord Darth Malgus was to be dispatched directly to the Jedi Temple. Although Malgus wished to lead the assault on the Temple alone, Angral insisted that their fellow Lord Adraas, a political ally of his and a rival of Malgus, serve as a second-in-command in the attack. Before any of the Sith could proceed however, the defense grid protecting Coruscant had to be disabled. The task fell to the Mandalorian Shae Vizla, who travelled to the ecumenopolis in advance of the Sith. Darth Malgus also traveled to the world prior to the battle, accompanied by his slave and lover, Eleena Daru. Malgus, who had expertise in organizing surprise attacks, orchestrated a plan for entering the Jedi Temple that involved a hijacked NR2 gully jumper depositing fifty Sith Warriors directly into the building. This plan required that Malgus serve as a distraction for the Jedi while the vessel entered the airspace of the Temple district. As they waited for Vizla to complete her objective and for his warriors to get into place, Malgus toured Coruscant with Daru, admiring and criticizing the world one final time before its destruction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, the peace summit was being held on the Core World Alderaan, a planet that had previously come under attack by the Empire. The Republic delegation, led by Senator Paran Am-Ris and Jedi Master Dar'Nala, met with the Imperial delegation led by the Sith Lord Darth Baras to discuss a possible cessation of hostilities. Baras maintained the facade of a peace-seeking diplomat early in the negotiation process, which was made all the more believable by the Sith's withdrawal from their offensive in the Minos Cluster. As the peace conference began, however, Darth Malgus received word on Coruscant that Vizla had compromised the defense grid without alerting Republic authorities and that the dropship was in position to begin its descent. With that, the Sith unleashed their assault on the world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The invasion"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Assault on the Jedi Temple"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Malgus and Eleena Daru traveled to the Jedi Temple on foot, approaching the ancient edifice via the Processional Way. As they neared the Temple's main entrance, the two were surrounded by Republic soldiers who had been assigned to guard the building while most Jedi were away either fighting the Sith or participating in the peace talks. Malgus quickly dispatched all of the security personnel in his path and continued into the Temple itself. Meanwhile, Shae Vizla infiltrated the Temple Ziggurat through an exposed hatch in order to join the Sith in their fight within. The Mandalorian continued to battle Republic security forces in the Temple's upper levels, while throngs of curious Jedi confronted Malgus and Daru below. Padawans gathered on upper mezzanines to see the Sith as he was confronted by a cadre of six Jedi Knights led by one Master, Ven Zallow. As Zallow and the Knights approached Malgus to bar him from penetrating any further into the Temple, the Sith Warriors within the Republic drop ship piloted the vessel directly into the large doorway shielding the main entrance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The drop ship smashed through the large gate that served as the Temple's main entrance and continued on to reduce much of the entrance hall to rubble. The careening ship and the huge mass of rubble it created crushed a number of Jedi before coming to a halt directly behind Malgus and Daru. The drop ship's hatch blew open to reveal the fifty Sith Warriors led by Lord Adraas, as well as several Imperial soldiers. After disembarking from the craft, the Sith forces were attacked by dozens of Jedi in defense of the Temple. The Jedi and Sith fought viciously, battling one another with the Force and their lightsabers while Daru darted through the battlefield, assisting her lover. When the Twi'lek slave was nearly killed by a Zabrak Padawan, Malgus intervened and killed the Jedi. Meanwhile, Adraas cut a swath through the fray, using telekinetic powers to throw the few surviving Republic soldiers across the hall. As Malgus loosed bolts of Force lightning against a number of his opponents, Vizla revealed herself and engaged Republic soldiers with rockets and a flamethrower."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Immersed in the dark side of the Force, Malgus continued on to slay many of the Temple's defenders while his Twi'lek lover provided support for him and the other Sith. Malgus's primary goal during the melee was to hunt down and kill Zallow, whom he felt was the only combatant worthy of his attention. Zallow was meanwhile making headway against the Sith Warriors, killing a number of them and rebuffing Adraas's attacks. When Malgus finally located the Jedi Master, Daru attempted to assist him by firing at Zallow. This tactic backfired, however, and Zallow deflected Daru's blaster bolts back into her body before throwing her against a column with the Force. Zallow's attack on Daru enraged Malgus, who unleashed a Force scream that toppled some of the surrounding architecture. The Sith Lord and the Jedi Master closed the distance between one another, killing any who crossed their paths. Upon meeting, Zallow and Malgus entered into a fierce duel, fighting one another back toward the Processional Way. Although their duel was interrupted by fellow Jedi and Sith who wanted to intervene, the two defeated all of their other opponents and focused on one another. Zallow was able to defend against Malgus for a time and avoid many of his attacks, but the Jedi Master eventually fell to the Sith Lord, who thrust his lightsaber through Zallow's abdomen. With their leading Master dead, the Jedi were quickly defeated. Among the Jedi who fell were a pair of married Jedi Knights, the Togruta Rolend and Yanila Zavros. The skirmish won, Sith secured the Temple and destroyed the defence grid mainframe that lay within the structure before Adraas signaled to Darth Angral that the strike had been a success."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Angral's naval forces entered Coruscant space and were hailed by Orbital Security Station Six, a Coruscant Security space station monitoring all incoming traffic to Coruscant. Femi, a Twi'lek aboard the station, did not recognize the vessels, and addressed the incoming Sith warships in request of a clearance code. Darth Angral responded by ordering his admiral to open fire on the station, thereby killing Femi and everyone else on board. The fleet, led by Angral's flagship, Darkness, pushed forward into Coruscant's atmosphere and began ravaging the cityscape. As Mark VI Supremacy-class starfighters, B28 Extinction-class bombers, Sith battlecruisers, and Imperial war droids razed the Temple district, Malgus and his fellow warriors sat at the ruined entrance of the Jedi Temple and watched Galactic City burn."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Coruscant falls"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first wave of ground forces were delivered to Coruscant's surface via landing shuttle. The squads of Imperial soldiers aboard were intended to be little more than cannon fodder to distract the Republic's defenses while their superiors moved onwards towards their primary targets, but one young officer\u2014the Human Hesker\u2014refused to be so easily disposed. Instead, he rallied and led his fellow soldiers in a vicious assault that broke the Republic's first lines of defense. Hesker's leadership turned the early stages of the battle into a rout, allowing for the rest of Coruscant to fall quickly. Meanwhile, Angral's fleet of battle cruisers continued its descent toward Coruscant, focused on the Senate District. Angral ordered that he and a strike team be deployed outside the Senate Building, while the remainder of the Sith forces continue their attack on the city. As the warships began bombarding the Senate District, Angral and his troops landed outside the Senate, where they were confronted by Jedi Master Orgus Din and Lieutenant Harron Tavus of the Republic Military. While Tavus and several Coruscant Security personnel battled the Sith troopers, Angral attacked Din. The pair entered into a fierce lightsaber duel, with Angral soon gaining the upper hand. The Sith was ultimately able to disarm Master Din and force him to the ground, holding him at lightsaber point. Although Angral wished to make Din his first Jedi kill of the day, a badly damaged Imperial warship fell from the sky and collided with a nearby building, resulting in an explosion that sent both Din and the Sith Lord flying. This gave Din an opening to leap across a broken bridge and head toward the Jedi Temple, which was under heavy bombardment. Angral ordered his men to allow the Jedi to escape, as their objective was in the Senate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Senate Building, the Republic's chief executive, Supreme Chancellor Berooken, attempted to contact Senator Am-Ris on Alderaan. As Republic senators and his own office staff fled the building, the Mon Calamari Chancellor remained behind, warning the Cerean Senator of the Sith's treachery and urging him to pull out of the peace talks. Before he could finish his message, however, Angral smashed into the Senate and killed the Chancellor. Berooken's assassination, which was not part of the original invasion plan, was witnessed by the participants of the Alderaan Peace Conference, spurring a short conflict between the Republic and Imperial delegations. As the battle continued on Coruscant, a number of senators were killed by the invasion force, and the late Chancellor's majestic and powerful executive cruiser was obliterated. Jedi Master Usma, one of the Order's most celebrated duelists, was among the casualties in the fighting on the ground, having been killed by Darth Angral's apprentice, Lord Praven. Praven also killed a Republic soldier whose son, Fir Megsan, would later set a bounty on the Sith's head in an attempt to gain revenge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith armada continued heavy orbital bombardment of the planet, while Imperial troops raided the city's towers. Under the command of Sith Lord Javis Koldor, fleets of Harrower-class cruisers inflicted particularly severe losses on Coruscant. Koldor's flagship, the Scream of Ragnos killed untold numbers of civilians and defenders, thereby gaining a reputation as a symbol of Imperial might. The Senate District sustained heavy damage, and the Senate Dome was captured by Sith forces. The Temple Precinct suffered heavily as well, with starfighters strafing the area and Sith war droids marching on the Temple itself. The few civilian airspeeders that remained airborne were actively pursued by Imperial fighters and shot down, while Republic Military craft were destroyed before they could even join the battle. The cityscape was engulfed in hundreds of fires, and Imperial bombers eventually struck a power station that sent a massive flare of plasma half a kilometer into the sky. During the fighting, six members of the Jedi High Council were killed. In addition, Darth Malgus and his warriors used the explosives they had brought with them aboard the hijacked drop ship to bring down the Jedi Temple. Master Din and Lieutenant Tavus attempted to reach the structure before it fell, but arrived just as it began to crumble. The centuries-old edifice collapsed completely, either killing or trapping any surviving Jedi within. Imperial troopers joined Malgus' group in fighting off survivors at the Temple, with a soldier named Westro priding himself on shooting a Jedi in the back. Several Jedi elsewhere on Coruscant attempted to stage a counterstrike against a vessel of the Imperial Nav, but were repelled by the ship's commander, Rycus Kilran. Despite heavy wounds sustained during the attempt, Kilran continued to participate in the battle and inflicted heavy damage upon the city. The Republic's General Var Suthra led defense forces against the Empire as well, but to no avail\u2014the day instead belonged to Imperial champions like Darth Lachris. One highly successful Republic defender was Jedi Master Kellian Jarro; in the streets of the city, Master Jarro single-handedly killed more than one hundred Mandalorian veterans who had accompanied the Sith in their attack.

Many natives fled downward in search of safety, but these deeper regions of the city became a target as well, and were similarly hit by heavy orbital bombardment. Despite being under the protection of surviving Jedi and Republic Military forces, the refugees were devastated by the bombardment, which resulted in many civilian deaths. While wounded Imperial forces were taken for recuperation on medical ships in orbit, the Sith continued to bombard the planet, killing tens of thousands, if not more. Above the planet, the privateer Free Spacers Fleet, led by Republic freelancer Admiral Zale Barrows, clashed with the Imperial Navy. The Sith attackers were successful in securing their orbital position, and the engagement marked the last action of the privateer fleet. The Sith completed their capture of Coruscant by destroying or removing all orbital satellites, thereby initiating a communications blackout between the capital and the rest of the galaxy. Although the original plan behind the attack included the razing and complete destruction of Galactic City, the final bombardment never came\u2014instead, the Emperor ordered that Lord Baras continue negotiations on Alderaan, and use the situation on Coruscant as leverage. As the Republic delegation was unable to open communications with the Senate, Dar'Nala and Am-Ris were therefore unaware of the severity of the events. The Jedi and Republic diplomats were forced to accept Lord Baras's appraisal of the situation, which asserted that any reluctance to comply with the Empire's demands would cause further repercussions on Coruscant\u2014specifically, further loss of civilian life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The occupation"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Martial law"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the hours following the initial invasion and capture of Coruscant, Imperial military forces transitioned from combat protocols to occupation procedures. While bombers returned to their cruisers, starfighters adopted patrol formations and began periodic sweeps of the cityscape. As theater commander, Darth Angral took control of the world and declared martial law, thereby prohibiting any vessels from leaving the surface and refusing access to all inbound traffic. The Sith Lord formed a blockade around Coruscant, comprised of at least two battlecruisers, while a third cruiser orbited one of the world's moons. Any non-Imperial ship that approached Coruscant during this time was swiftly met by Sith interceptors and impounded aboard one of the cruisers. Captain Jard, commander of Darth Malgus's cruiser, the Valor, was one of the ranking officers of the blockade fleet and oversaw operations on the ship while Malgus was on-planet. Meanwhile, patrols of Imperial war droids were sent into the lower reaches of Galactic City to root out civilians who had fled there during the invasion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Angral commandeered the office of the deceased Chancellor and turned it into his own command headquarters, with Officer Roon Neele serving as his attach\u00e9. From those offices, the Sith Lord disbanded the Galactic Senate and ordered that many of the surviving senators be executed. Despite the harshness with which he dealt with the enemy government, Angral allowed search and rescue teams to begin efforts to recover those who had been wounded and lost in the initial assault. Simultaneously, he ordered that Imperial forces take control of a local hospital, so that wounded Imperial troopers and Sith Warriors could be triaged before being transported to medical ships, like the Steadfast. In defiance of Darth Malgus's orders to have his lover Daru immediately transported to the Steadfast, Lord Adraas instead redirected her to the hospital, where she was left behind by the other Imperials who eventually moved up to the medical ship. Meanwhile, Angral attempted to raise Malgus on his comlink; when the subordinate Sith failed to respond, Angral instead sought out Adraas and asked him to speak in Malgus's stead. While Adraas reported on the raid of the Jedi Temple, Malgus waited at the ruins of the ancient building, unaware that an occupation had been initiated\u2014the Sith Lord still believed that the Empire was planning on bombarding the planet from orbit and destroying the ecumenopolis.

Upon departing from the Senate Building, Malgus traveled to the hospital where Daru was being treated so that he might collect and transport her to a more appropriate medical facility aboard the Valor. The hospital, which had been relieved from Imperial control, had become inundated with the wounded from across the city. When Malgus arrived outside the facility, a large crowd of grieving and injured Coruscanti civilians recognized him as a Sith Lord and cajoled him for his participation in the attack. After a member of the crowd threw a chunk of duracrete at him, Malgus was forced to disperse the mob with a telekinetic Force wave. The effort killed a number of the hecklers and provided the Sith Lord with a clear entry into the hospital, wherein he found Daru and relieved her from the care of the Republic medical doctors. Angral later placed Malgus in command of the naval blockade around the planet, charging him with the responsibility of securing the hyperspace lanes in and out of the area."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Security breaches"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Malgus was in control of the Imperial fleet, he oversaw the arrival of supply superfreighter convoys and their frigate escorts.

As per security procedures, the vessel was surrounded by Mk. VII advanced interceptors and electromagnetically tugged to the Valor, where its pilot, former Imperial sniper\u2013turned\u2013bounty hunter Vrath Xizor, was arrested and questioned. Xizor cooperated with the Imperials, and was eventually granted an audience with Malgus\u2014he furnished the Sith Lord with information that a spice smuggler by the name of Zeerid Korr was bound for Coruscant, and would attempt to run the blockade and ferry the renegade Jedi Knight Aryn Leneer to the surface.

After successfully avoiding detection for a short period by attaching themselves to the hull of one of the superfreighters, the Fatman was discovered by Imperial shuttles searching for anomalies in the convoy. Understanding that an inconspicuous entry into Coruscant's atmosphere was no longer a viable option, Korr piloted the Fatman close enough to one of the freighters to prevent Sith forces from firing on his vessel. Under the orders of Darth Malgus, the freighter convoy and its frigate escorts dispersed, leaving the XS light freighter open to fire from the Valor. The Sith Lord was intrigued by Leneer, however, and so chose to impound the ship instead of destroying it. As the Fatman raced toward Coruscant's atmosphere, it was trapped in the Valor's tractor beam but was able to escape its pull. Malgus's weapons officer, Lieutenant Makk, immediately opened fire on the fleeing vessel and managed to destroy the Fatman shortly after it entered the atmosphere."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leneer and Korr escaped the doomed ship by jumping from the cockpit just before it was completely destroyed.

Daru was placed in command of Imperial Captain Kerse and his squad, and together they traveled to the Sith-controlled Liston Spaceport in a set of three Imperial shuttles. Concurrently, Leneer and Korr traveled to the destroyed Jedi Temple in the hopes of finding evidence regarding the individual who had killed Zallow. Although Leneer was certain that a Sith had committed the murder, she was unaware that it was Malgus who had killed her Master.

The only regions of the planet that were sufficiently rebuilt were those that were required for governance and trade; vast regions of the ecumenopolis were left untouched after the invasion, much of the infrastructure was left in ruins, and the booming refugee population resulted in an increasingly desperate class of criminals and paupers. Food riots, separatist uprisings, and rampant looting swept the planet's lower levels, as the destitute populace was forced to eek out a living in the ruins left by the Sith. The areas that saw such strife were left to rebuild on their own, but quickly fell to the control of gangs during the Cold War. The Black Sun criminal organization became particularly prominent in certain districts, including in Gnawer's Roost. In the Old Galactic Market sector, alien war refugees and Coruscant natives whose homes had been destroyed by Imperial bombs overran and occupied the commercial hub. The squatters took the market as their own, and when they were commanded to leave by Republic authorities, they rioted, turning the entire sector into a warzone. The refugees eventually came under both the protection and exploitation of the Migrant Merchants' Guild\u2014a criminal syndicate that, alongside the Black Sun, led an armed insurrection that greatly hindered the rebuilding of Coruscant. The rise of gang activity quickly led to the creation of a radical group of vigilantes known as the Justicars' Brigade. These bloodthirsty marauders established a law of their own and fought against criminal activity, but primarily in the interest of maintaining their own territory, as opposed to protecting average citizenry."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Justicars were known for extremely violent responses to street crime, there were other interests that set out to help the downtrodden in the post-sacking Coruscant Underworld. One such individual was Larin Moxla, a former Republic trooper who busied herself by wandering the areas of the planet that had been hard-hit by the Sith, attempting to root out crime and aid the defenseless where she could. Senator Oranda oversaw the repair of ruined water, power, and waste infrastructure that had been neglected for nearly a decade after the Sith attack. With the aid of protocol droids from the Gree Enclave, Oranda moved forward with reconstruction projects that most other officials had given up on. However, most of the responsibility for reconstruction fell on the shoulders of Vanara Kayl, the Coruscanti politician who replaced Supreme Chancellor Janarus as senator and governor of the capital. In the early years of the undertaking, donations from across the Republic aided in Kayl's efforts, but the corruption and political inefficiencies of government resulted in a lengthy, drawn-out reconstruction. In light of the challenges, a frustrated Senator Kayl delivered a passionate speech on the state of Coruscant that implied that interference with the ongoing reconstruction process verged on treason; the diatribe impressed the Chancellor, who granted the senator full authority over the project. Kayl eventually expanded the scope of her focus to include cleaning up gangs and protecting Coruscant from anarchist terror cells, but the Coruscant Security Force found it difficult to complete the tasks on its own. After having lost much of its personnel during the sacking, the police force was asked to perform riot control duties and stage military interventions in civilian centers\u2014orders that were expected in the immediate aftermath of the occupation, but continued to be given over the course of the following decade.
