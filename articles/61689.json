Ho'Din had long, suction cup-tipped fingers used for climbing trees and, on their heads, red-violet snake-like \"hair\" (fleshy tubes covered in scales) which acted as thermal sensors. They claimed to have evolved from plants\u2014in fact, \"Ho'Din\" translated as \"walking flower\" in Basic. They were noted for possessing two hearts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their claims to botanical origins was probably a consequence of the nature-worshiping religion most Ho'Din followed, known as Dinante Fli'R. Most non-Ho'Din scientists found such claims unlikely, classifying them as reptilian instead. Whatever their origins, the Ho'Din were among the galaxy's greatest botanists and ecologists. Master Gardener was a title of respect among them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 5000 BBY, a female Ho'Din going by the name of Lohjoy served the Sith Empire as a starship engineer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 300 BBY, the tree-dwelling Ho'Din gave up their low-technology lifestyle and moved to the forest floor. There, they began mining, farming, and manufacturing. However, their understanding of ecology was rudimentary, and they did not foresee the consequences of deforestation. The decaying organisms which formerly accelerated the decay of plant life on the forest floor became parasites which caused disease and malnourishment in their Ho'Din hosts. The Ho'Din were forced back to the trees, where they refocused their resources on ecological and botanical research. Ho'Din referred to this period as the \"Great Rape of the Land.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ho'Din eventually developed herbal therapies which rid themselves of parasites. Their pharmacological techniques, combined with the eventual restoration of Moltok's ecosystem, allowed them to survive and prosper as a civilization. Other forms of technology were strictly regulated on Moltok, though off-world Ho'Din accepted them as a necessary evil when used on other, already \"damaged\", planets. Exports of Ho'Din plants and medicines made Moltok a very wealthy planet. Much of this wealth was spent in rejuvenating planets with damaged ecosystems, or creating \"garden worlds\" where all could commune with nature. Reverence for nature dominated Ho'Din society, with the Dinante Fli'R priests ruling Moltok."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Ho'Din in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Most Ho'Din who lived away from Moltok were botanists.
