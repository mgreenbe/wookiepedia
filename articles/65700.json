The military was composed of the Imperial Navy and  Imperial Army, and also the Stormtrooper Corps; making up the Remnant's war machine were traditional Imperial vehicles such as Star Destroyers, TIE series starfighters, and Imperial walkers. The Council of Moffs in theory held most of the power but the Supreme Commander of the Imperial Fleet in practice lead the Remnant from its inception in 12 ABY, the Remnant was later ruled by a Head of State, which eventually became a democratically electable position in a wave of sweeping reforms.

With a well-defined stretch of territory and several Star Dreadnoughts in his fleet, Pellaeon was elected Supreme Commander by the Moffs of the Rim factions. Pellaeon continued the former Galactic Empire's fight against the New Republic in the ongoing Galactic Civil War, and expanded the Remnant's borders through the successful Orinda campaign in that year. However, New Republic advances continually won territory over the next seven years, reducing Imperial space to just eight sectors in the Outer Rim and forcing a relocation of the Imperial capital from Orinda to Bastion. Realizing that the war was lost, Pellaeon sued for peace in 19 ABY; although his efforts were nearly undermined by a power grab from a Sinister Triumvirate of Imperials, he exposed them as traitors and signed the Bastion Accords with New Republic Chief of State Ponc Gavrisom."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A tense relationship between the Empire and the New Republic existed in peace time, and when the latter government requested Imperial assistance in repelling an invasion by the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong in 25 ABY, the Moffs elected to instead sit the Yuuzhan Vong War out and fortify their own territory against the invaders. After conquering much of the galaxy and capturing the New Republic capital of Coruscant, the Yuuzhan Vong attacked Bastion in 28 ABY and forced an Imperial retreat. Pellaeon was finally able to convince the reluctant Moff Council to take the fight to the enemy, and under his direction, the Imperial Remnant joined the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, the New Republic's successor state. 29 ABY saw the Yuuzhan Vong defeated by the Galactic Alliance's combined fleets at Coruscant, and Pellaeon later retired, but 41 ABY saw him resume his role as Supreme Commander when Galactic Alliance Chief of State Darth Caedus requested the Remnant's aid in prosecuting the Second Galactic Civil War against a Confederation of breakaway planets.

When Adye Prittick, the ranking admiral, proved indecisive, Admiral Blitzer Harrsk took part of the fleet and retreated into the Deep Core until a clear chain of command could be established. As the Emperor had never provided a succession plan in the event of his death, other naval officers followed Harrsk's example and fortified their holdings, declaring themselves independent warlords. Grand Vizier Sate Pestage claimed the Imperial throne and, wary of Alliance strikes against key targets, fortified strategic systems and fortress worlds, which put the Empire on the defensive despite their numerical and economic advantages over the Rebels.

Following the death of self-proclaimed Emperor Xandel Carivus in 11 ABY, utter collapse of Imperial authority ensued, and the Galactic Empire ceased to exist.

Unwilling to give up their power, the feuding warlords dismissed her ideas and continued their Imperial Civil War against each other. While she was at the fortress of \"Supreme Warlord\" Blitzer Harrsk in 12 ABY, the forces of \"High Admiral\" Treuten Teradoc attacked, fleeing after destroying the flagship of Harrsk's fleet. Harrsk ordered her at blasterpoint to lead a counterassault, and in orbit above Teradoc's own fortress, Daala, fed up with the warlords' squabbling, fired an ion cannon from the bridge of the Star Destroyer Firestorm at Harrsk's own Whirlwind and ordered the fleet to stand down."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pellaeon, now a Vice Admiral in Teradoc's fleet, found himself agreeing with Daala's assertions over an open comm channel that the warlords needed to stop fighting amongst themselves and focus their efforts against the New Republic.

The ship fled into hyperspace along with the 13X and one more of Pellaeon's Destroyers to a negotiating point in the dead of space, where Daala and Pellaeon agreed that a leader needed to be chosen from among the warlords, and proposed a detente council. Using both of their reputations as pull, Pellaeon convinced thirteen Deep Core warlords\u2014including Harrsk, Teradoc, Sander Delvardus, and Malfkla Yzu\u2014to convene at a space station called Tsoss Beacon, where they met inside of a storeroom. Daala insisted that they unite their forces and choose a nominal leader, but when three hours' worth of arguing amounted to nothing, she donned a breath mask.

Before leaving, he discovered squadrons of robotic TIEs, caches of arms, mines, and the Star Dreadnoughts Megador and Dominion within abandoned Deep Core armories. As the Outer and Mid Rims offered more resources, better-traveled hyperlanes, and favorable opportunities to harass New Republic shipping, Pellaeon pledged his fleets to protect the Imperial Rim factions on the condition that they joined his Empire. The Moffs of the Rim factions, including the Pentastar Alignment, agreed that the Megador, Dominion, and the Reaper\u2014a dreadnaught belonging to the Pentastar Alignment\u2014were enough to defend against the New Republic, and named Pellaeon the Supreme Commander of the new Imperial Remnant.

As such, Pellaeon decided to show his enemies that the New Order was not yet dead by defending what he saw as the Empire's borders. While the fleet was preparing to mount an offensive against the New Republic, Imperial agents took over the New Republic embassy on the planet Dathomir in order to investigate the ancient Star Temple and determine if the Infinity Wave superweapon could be used in the war.
