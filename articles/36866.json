She acted as an agent at Lando Calrissian's asteroid refinery on the world of Sarnus in the Chiloon Rift, where the Qrephs tried to swindle Calrissian of his refinery. When it was evident that Calrissian refused to do so, Yus was assigned to sabotage the factory and lead to its destruction. The sabotage was successful, but after Yus saw that it led to the deaths of nearly thirty thousand workers, along with that of her secret lover, rather than the few hundred she thought would be caught in the destruction, she felt guilty, even though that didn't affect her allegiance to the Qrephs much."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After helping the Qrephs' hired Mandalorians capture Han Solo, the brothers left her to die aboard their mobile headquarters, the Ormni, by having her wither away from lack of feeding enzymes needed to sustain her.
