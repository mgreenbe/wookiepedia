The princess joked that she had been able to do because she had eaten plenty of ruica while growing up, causing her partner to laugh. Organa's adoptive father Bail Organa then arrived in an airspeeder and scolded his daughter for missing class before taking her away and leaving the woman atop the mountain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While fighting, the sparring partner wore a white outfit with metal gauntlets.
