He was Fynn Torve's contact for smuggling food and basic supplies to the Gado Hill Clans. Han Solo suspected him to be an extremist religious figure, based on his title and a black, crystal-embedded necklace he wore. The Reverend played along with this characterization, making others believe he sought the elimination of all gambling. He caused a scene at the LoBue and accused Han Solo of cheating at sabacc, causing a scene that eventually enabled Solo, Lando Calrissian, and Torve to escape the scrutiny of the Abregado security forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
