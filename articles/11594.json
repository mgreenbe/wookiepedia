Designed for infiltration and action behind enemy lines, they were also used to perform security, bodyguard and enforcer duties for certain high-ranking Separatists. Ruthless, lethal and adaptive, these droids were the bane of Republic clone troopers and were able to put even a Jedi on the back foot. However, their hefty price tag prevented them from being mass-produced."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Part of an advanced droid series, BX-series commando droids were advanced, sturdier versions of B1-series battle droids. They were programmed with improved combat tactics and battlefield awareness and equipped with glowing white photoreceptors. Commando droid captains and other high-ranking commando droids bore white identifiers on their heads and chests."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to a more compact head than the B1, commando droids could don Phase I clone trooper armor for infiltration missions. Their heavy armor improved durability and allowed them to withstand several direct hits from a DC-15A blaster carbine, though a point-blank headshot with an ELG-3A blaster pistol was capable of destroying one instantly. Additionally, commando droids were extremely agile and acrobatic, and were able to move and react much faster than a standard battle droid. They were even able to continue fighting after sustaining significant damage such as having their legs sliced off with a lightsaber, in contrast to standard B1 battle droids that could be defeated simply by knocking them over. For improved infiltration capabilities, commando droids were able to alter their vocabulators in order to imitate clone troopers. However, their awkward movements in the armor and atypical responses to orders (usually \"roger, roger,\" a common battle-droid response) meant that observant individuals could see through the ruse. Commando droids were also quite strong, as one was able to lift Clone Captain CT-7567 \"Rex\" up by his neck. Commando droids were skilled in melee combat, using vibroswords in close quarters as well as being very agile, able to leap and contort their bodies to avoid blasterfire and surprise enemies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While they had numerous improvements over rank-and-file B1 battle droids, their production costs proved to be much higher, causing the B1 to continue to remain the standard infantry for the Confederacy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Elite troops of the Droid Army"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, when commando droids were still considered new, General Grievous used commando droids to infiltrate and take control of the Republic's Rishi Moon Station. At first, the droids landed in a Droch-class boarding ship and, after ambushing the deck officer, CT-327, they forced their way into the base and killed Clone Sergeant \"O'Niner\" and all of his men save four clones that escaped through a ventilation shaft. They were able to maintain control of the station until Clone Commander CC-2224 \"Cody\" and Clone Captain CT-7567 \"Rex\" arrived to inspect the station. Along with the survivors of the Rishi Station unit, Cody and Rex were able to retake the listening post from the commando droids and destroy them. However, droid reinforcements arrived at the station, so one of the station's clone troopers, Hevy, sacrificed himself destroy the base. The commando droids had hard-wired the base's all-clear signal, so the only way to alert the Republic of a planned Separatist attack on Kamino was to destroy the station, but the detonator did not link up with the tibanna that was to be used to destroy the station. This forced Hevy to activate it himself, so Hevy sacrificed himself for the closest thing a clone trooper could call home. The base was destroyed, and the Republic stopped receiving the all-clear signal, which alerted them that something was wrong. A Republic fleet arrived at the Rishi moon, and Grievous and his fleet, being outgunned, were forced to retreat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At least two commando droids were stationed in Lessu during the Battle of Ryloth. There they attempted to stop the ARF troopers \"Stak\" and CT-6910 \"Razor\" from activating the plasma bridge, but were defeated. The two ARF troopers activated the bridge, and Lessu was ultimately taken by the Republic and the Twi'lek Resistance. Separatist leader Wat Tambor was captured, and the Separatist occupation of Ryloth came to an end."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "General Grievous used commando droids when he boarded Jedi Council member Eeth Koth's flagship, the Steadfast, when he captured Koth. Later, in the Saleucami system, Grievous and his tactical droid, TV-94, then used them against fellow Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Adi Gallia, and Anakin Skywalker as they rescued Koth from Grievous. A pair of commando droids then acted as snipers after Grievous was forced to crash-land on Saleucami's surface. One of the droids then shot Captain Rex as he approached them leading a speeder patrol. The shot pierced the clone captain's armor and would have gone straight through his heart had it been two inches to the left. Both droids were promptly run down and shot by Rex's companions. While Rex was recovering at a farmstead, he discovered that it belonged to a clone deserter named Cut Lawquane, whose adopted children stumbled across a Separatist escape pod that had crashed in one of their fields. Their exploration of the pod led to them accidentally activating its complement of commando droids, who proceeded to attack the homestead as Rex and Cut defended it. Despite being heavily damaged, the droids gave the clones a considerable fight and caused extensive damage to the homestead before they were all destroyed."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The war continues"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bounty hunter Cad Bane used a pair of commando droids when he held several members of the Galactic Senate hostage.

The Confederate commander Darts D'Nar had two with him as his guards when he negotiated with Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi for his surrender. Kenobi fought D'Nar in hand-to-hand combat, and this distracted him while Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano disarmed all of D'Nar's bombs in the city. After being informed of this, Kenobi swiftly destroyed both droids by lifting them into the air and crushing them with the Force. D'Nar escaped from Kenobi by using a bomb he had hidden in his T-series tactical droid, much to the tactical droid's horror, but Skywalker and Tano caught up to D'Nar, and he was captured by Tano."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Confederate\u2013Republic peace conference at Sundari on Mandalore, commando droids served as guards to the Confederate delegation.
