Following the battle, the Jedi and several clones are forced to flee in the Twilight; however, a squadron of vulture droids pursue them and deal heavy damage to the Twilight, including its hyperdrive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After damaging the ship, the Separatist forces board it using a Sheathipede-class transport shuttle. The clones are heavily wounded from the previous battle and are in no shape to fight, and the A5-RX battle tank they saved is also too damaged to operate. The two Jedi desperately begin to fend off the B1-Series battle droids emerging from the boarding shuttle; as they do, however, clone sergeant Gaffa leads the clone engineers in dismantling parts of their battle tank. Using their F-187 fusioncutters, they build a A5-RX spread-missile battle platform from its weapon system which they then use to destroy the Separatist shuttle as B2 super battle droids and droidekas begin to emerge. The clones then use the battle platform to destroy the remaining vulture droids and escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
