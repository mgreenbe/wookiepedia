In the Clone Wars during the opening phases of the Battle of Kamino, General Grievous of the Confederacy of Independent Systems had his warships organized into Echo-3. This was done so the transports could take damage from the Galactic Republic space forces defending Kamino, and could fall into the ocean surface of the planet, and hidden in the debris were Separatist Trident-class assault ships then used to attack Tipoca City, but the Republic would ultimately win the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
