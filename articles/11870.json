Bai claimed that it was the result of her posing in the June 2005 issue of Playboy, but George Lucas insisted that the cuts were made nearly a year prior to her posing for the magazine. Her scenes were later featured in the \"Deleted Scenes\" category on the Revenge of the Sith DVD. On the DVD, Lucas reiterated his claim, saying her scenes were deleted for length."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
