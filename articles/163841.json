A Whiphid using this trance would lower their metabolism to the point where they sometimes seemed to be dead, but in fact, their body would be repairing its injuries. During the Clone Wars, K'Kruhk used this ability several times to survive what would otherwise have been fatal wounds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
