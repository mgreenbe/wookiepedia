They were regularly served flambeed and then smothered in a thick broth. In 22 BBY the Human chef Gab'borah Hise prepared stewed, flaming collypods with Tangerette cream and figs, whilst he worked for the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. Before the dish, which the cook considered delicious, was served to the Hutt, his Twi'lek Majordomo Bib Fortuna tried a sample, but one collypod was still alive and as it was aflame, managed to set the Twi'lek's sleeve on fire. Hise managed to put out the fire and bribed Fortuna a months worth of the cook's salary and a Ziziibbon truffle to persuade the majordomo not to have him thrown in the Sarlacc pit near Jabba's Palace on the planet Tatooine. Later that day he recounted the tale to the Mandalorian Bounty hunter Boba Fett whilst traveling to Jabba's fortress in an air yacht."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Collypods were first mentioned in the 2003 young readers novel Boba Fett: Hunted written by Elizabeth Hand.
