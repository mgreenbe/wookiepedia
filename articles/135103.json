Attendees included Jedi Master Avar Kriss and Admiral Pevel Kronara of the Republic Defense Coalition, whose cruiser Third Horizon was in transit for refueling nearby. After the conclave had ended, Shai Tennem, the overseer of the Starlight Beacon's construction, insisted on giving the attendees a lengthy tour of the station which delayed their departure. Besides Kriss and Kronara, Jedi on the tour included Nib Assek and her Padawan Burryaga Agaburry, Mikkel Sutmani, and Te'Ami. During the tour, the party encountered technicians Joss and Pikka Adren, who were in a hurry attempting to locate and fix a last-minute flaw in the station's power systems. Tennem would have roped the Adrens into coming on the tour, but Burryaga sensed their emotions, and he and Assek ensured they could get back to their work. The delay Tennem caused in the Third Horizon's departure from the Starlight meant that the cruiser and those onboard were in an ideal position to assist when a distress signal was picked up from the Hetzal system, leading the starship to race to the star system's aid with many of those who had attended the conclave as part of the rescue party."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The conclave on the Starlight Beacon first appeared in the short story \"Starlight: Part One - Go Together.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
