The Bradden system contained the planet Dom-Bradden, homeworld of the Affytechans, a sentient vegetable species. The Drexel system contained a single planet, a water world eponymously named Drexel. Drexel was orbited by Three Moons which were incorporated into oaths of the planet's Human inhabitants. These Humans were exiled to the world by Jedi Knights, and created a society built on floating structures. The Human immigrants shared the world with the native Sea-dragons, and some the of the Humans developed a mutually beneficial relationship with the Sea-dragons.

The Tenloss Syndicate was one of the largest non-Hutt criminal organizations in the Rim, having spread from the Bajic sector into not only the Lol, but also the Astal, Dail, and Skine sectors. In the Lol sector, its businesses included the Kendamari Casinos operating out of Kendamar, which provided a chain of gambling facilities throughout the sector, catering for upper-class client\u00e8le. They also sponsored sporting events, such as annual sun jammer races, drawing prospective gamblers from neighboring sectors. Despite Tenloss' independence, a number of the more prosperous casinos were rumored to be controlled by Hutt operatives. The planet Majilop was home to the Lucin Syndicate, a Tenloss-affiliate, and a major producer and distributor of illegal holoporn to the Rim.
