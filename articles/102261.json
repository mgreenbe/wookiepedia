Most reptiles were oviparous. Example of non reptilian species that used that reproductive mode included mollusks like the swamp slugs, reptavians like the peko-peko, avians like the Pylat birds, and amphibians like the Shawda Ubb. Although untypical, some mammals, like the S'kytri, were oviparous."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
