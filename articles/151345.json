Although the Rebels didn't know anything about the man's identity or location, one of them dared to draw a blaster on Valance\u2014in response, the hunter viciously mowed down the entire Rebel cell, and moved along on his search. Not long after, the Sith Lord Darth Vader arrived on Ultaar with a complement of Imperial stormtroopers, seeking the same information.
