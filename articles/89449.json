Meteor Squadron participated in an operation to take over the city districts of the planet Troithe, assisting with missions requiring heavier firepower alongside the Y-wing starfighters of Hail Squadron. Meteor's X-wings were on standby 20 minutes away in case of an emergency when New Republic forces entered the Thannerhouse District."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later on, Meteor Squadron, led by Meteor Leader, took part in an attack on Troithe's capital district, the Troithe Planetary Defense Center (TPDC). As the squadron fought the TPDC's air defenses and TIE strikers, two Meteor pilots were lost to point-defense mounts, and Yrica Quell of the New Republic's Alphabet Squadron attempted to close her X-wing's strike foils for more maneuverability. Meteor Leader, interjected, arguing that it would take away Quell's fighting capability and had his squadron cover her as she traveled towards TPDC's shield generators. Hail Squadron soon joined the fray, and Meteor Squadron moved to counter TIE strikers and other enemy attempts to form an air defense."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Defense of Catadra"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the battle, Syndulla departed with a portion of her forces, leaving the remaining to set a trap for the Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing. The 204th eventually arrived in the Cerberon system, its two vessels, the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Edict and Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier Aerie, targeting Troithe and the planet Catadra respectively. Meteor Leader and his squadron deployed to defend Catadra, with members of Alphabet Squadron following not far behind. En route to the planet, the squadron commander called out the timings until his squadron decelerated for Catadra, assuring his comrades that they would have time to form up for the 204th attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Alphabet Squadron pilot Wyl Lark questioned whether the Aerie had deployed its complement yet, which Meteor Leader denied, downplaying the cruiser-carrier's weaponry as well. After Alphabet pilot Nath Tensent and Meteor Four, the Rodian Neihero, discussed the Edict's capabilities against Troithe, Meteor Leader joked that they were running for admiral, asking that they cut the chatter. Meteor Squadron soon decelerated in approach to Catadra, and formed up against the Aerie's squadron, nine TIE fighter drones led by three organically manned TIEs. In the ensuing battle, the TIE squadron was whittled down to two TIE pilots, one being immobilized, while Meteor Squadron was almost totally destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A male pilot, Meteor Leader believed that Yrica Quell required more fighting capability than maneuverability during the attack on the TPDC.
