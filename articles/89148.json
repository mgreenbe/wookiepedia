It allowed the Force-user to merge their senses with another creature such as an animal or something with a lower intelligence than that. The Force-user was able to perceive the world through the senses of the creature; they would see through its eyes, hear through its ears, smell through its olfactory senses, and physically feel whatever the creature touched. The Force-user did not control the creature, but through simple suggestions and requests, could influence the creature. If the Force-user tried to influence the creature to do something against its nature, or inherently dangerous, the creature would generally ignore it unless the Force-user strongly imposed their will on their target. During the merge, the Force-user's body was immobile, with its senses shut down. Withdrawing from the merge had to be done carefully, but the link could be broken if the host creature was injured or died. The Sullustan T'laerean Larn learned the power from the Wise Man of Kooroo on the planet Gelgelar, and successfully merged with a reeho."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
