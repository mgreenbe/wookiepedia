Bones functioned to move, support, and protect the various organs of the body, such as how the skull protected a being's brain, along with producing red and white blood cells and store minerals. Bone tissue was a type of dense connective tissue. Other organics had an exoskeleton or a cartilaginous skeletal structure. The Gungan species had a skeletal structure made of cartilaginous material rather than bone, which made their bodies more resistant to damage. After death, a vertebrate's body would decay, releasing its energy back into its ecosystem and leaving the bones behind. Over time, however, they would dissolve too and transfer energy and minerals back into the ecosystem."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Examples of bones"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cheekbones were bones that formed part of the Human face.
