An embryologist studied embryos and their development. An embryo developed naturally as part of Human reproduction, but could also be stimulated to grow artificially via cloning. Embryos of clone troopers were grown and monitored on Kamino in strictly controlled environments. When Obi-Wan Kenobi first inspected the Kamino cloning facilities, he felt waves of life-energy emanating from the countless embryos surrounding him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Embryonic development was not limited to Humans.
