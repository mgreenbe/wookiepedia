The spell allowed the caster to control the brightness of a nearby flame, such as torches or campfires. The Ascendant could not create a flame, nor did the spell increase the flame's damage or other effects. The caster could cause the flame to spike in brightness, or extinguish it completely."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
