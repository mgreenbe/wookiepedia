When the Nihil pirates plotted an attack on the Valo Republic Fair, they sent a team to disable the comm tower the day before the attack. The breach of the tower's security perimeter tripped an alarm which was responded to by Jedi Padawan Ram Jomaram and his droid, V-18, and they fought a brief skirmish with the pirates before watching them escape in their starship. Jomaram was arrested by the Valo Security Force after sneaking onto the fairgrounds in an attempt to warn the Valon Jedi Masters, so when the attack began the next day, he and Padawan Lula Talisola made a dangerous trek through the gas-choked Lonisa City to reach Crashpoint Tower and reactivate it so they could call for help, as none of the Jedi and Galactic Republic defenders were able to communicate with each other. When they reached the tower with Zeen Mrala, they found that the Nihil had seeded Drengir, dangerous sentient carnivorous plants, at the tower to ward away intruders. However, Jomaram was able to get the Drengir to leave by informing them that the Nihil had been lying to them and were killing the \"meat\" that they had hoped to harvest. After driving off attacking Nihil forces, Jomaram was able to repair the comm tower, allowing Valo's defenders to mount a counterattack against the pirates."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Crashpoint Tower first appeared in the 2021 novel The High Republic: Race to Crashpoint Tower."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
