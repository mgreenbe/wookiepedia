Makkeer, a member of the gang led by the pirate captain Gwarm, used an ion scrambler to disable the Millennium Falcon on Sakreen after tricking Han Solo into thinking he was being chased by the gang. Shortly afterward, Gwarm's gang were captured by the pirate queen Rane Mahal, who stole their ship, the Hand of Am-Shak. Solo planted the ion scrambler aboard the Hand of Am-Shak, disabling it when Mahal attempted to escape Sakreen and leaving both pirate crews stranded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
