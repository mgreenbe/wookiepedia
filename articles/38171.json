Its body consisted of a thick, bone-white trunk covered on the outside by tiny suckers. It moved like a worm, expanding and contracting, and its suckers allowed it to crawl up sheer surfaces and hang from ceilings. Extending from the form of its eyeless body were two limbs, ending in two clubs of chitin. It used its limbs to grab and constrict its prey, then swallow it whole. Dimlurkers had no teeth. A putrid stench emanated from dimlurkers, giving away their presence from far away. Though primarily predators, they were omnivores and could also subsist on moss and insects."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They lived primarily in the caverns beneath the Kystes' Spine on Talus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
