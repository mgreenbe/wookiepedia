The lightsaber was powered by a pair of kyber crystals retrieved by Kestis from the Crystal Cave on Ilum in 14 BBY. The crystals had originally been one, but had split in half when Kestis found them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The lightsaber, similar to Jaro Tapal's, was a double-bladed weapon. One blade could be ignited or both at the same time, allowing Kestis to use the weapon single-bladed or double-bladed respectively.

In the subsequent skirmish Kestis lost his original lightsaber and Tapal lost his life. In his dying breaths, Tapal bequeathed Kestis his own lightsaber. With the death of Tapal, Kestis went into hiding as a rigger in the Scrapper Guild on Bracca, secretly keeping the lightsaber of his fallen master on his person."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 14 BBY, Kestis was forced out of hiding when his connection to the Force was exposed. Now hunted by the Galactic Empire, Kestis joined the crew of the Stinger Mantis which was comprised of the Latero pilot Greez Dritus and the former Jedi Knight Cere Junda. Under the direction of Junda, Kestis underwent a journey to obtain the holocron of Jedi Master Eno Cordova and rebuild the Jedi Order with the list of Force-sensitive children contained on the aforementioned device. During his travels, Kestis used the lightsaber of his late master in combat against the Empire and other hostile forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, in the midst of his journey, Kestis accidentally crushed Tapal's weapon while experiencing a Force vision of his painful past in the Tomb of Kujet on Dathomir. The lightsaber was damaged beyond repair, prompting Kestis to journey to Ilum to construct a new lightsaber. In the days of the Jedi, Ilum had been a sacred world where Jedi younglings would retrieve a kyber crystal to construct their lightsaber with in a ritual known as the Gathering. Kestis himself had undergone this ritual as a youngling, where he had acquired the kyber crystal he used to build his first lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Journey to Ilum"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Touching down on Ilum, Kestis headed for the Jedi Temple where the Gathering had traditionally began while reminiscing about his previous visit to the icy planet. Although the Empire maintained an occupation of Ilum, Kestis didn't immediately encounter any Imperial forces. After entering the Temple, Kestis journeyed into the Crystal Cave, where younglings would've typically found their kyber crystals in the past. Although he encountered a few Imperial probe droids upon entering, Kestis was undeterred and pressed on in his pursuit of a crystal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Kestis fell into a chasm of icy water. Kestis began to freeze as he frantically tried to escape the deathly cold water. Fortunately, he was able to emerge from the water and find his crystal. Kestis crawled over to the crystal and grasped it in his hand, only for it to inexplicably split in half. Although he began to lose hope, Kestis' determination was rekindled by his droid companion BD-1, who was accompanying him in the crystal cave."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Spurred on by his newfound resolve, Kestis placed the two halves of the crystal on a base of ice and began forging a new lightsaber. For the hilt of the weapon, Kestis incorporated the remains of his master's broken lightsaber and the lightsaber used by Cere Junda when she walked the Jedi path. The lightsaber, like his master's, was a double-bladed weapon. However, in addition, the saber was also capable of splitting into two halves, acting as two single-bladed lightsabers. After forging the saber, Kestis ignited the weapon and split it in two, testing the functionality of the lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Jedi weapon"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Escape from Ilum"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Needing a new route out of the crystal caves, Kestis began slicing through a path of large icicles with the intention of making it back to his ship. Unfortunately, he cut a path into a local Imperial garrison consisting of scout troopers and KX-series security droids. Despite enemy reinforcements, Kestis was eventually able to overcome the gathered Imperial forces with his new lightsaber. As he continued to make his way back to the ship, Kestis used the weapon to slice numerous icicles that stood in his path. As he headed further towards the entrance he was once again met by Imperial resistance, with the addition of standard stormtroopers, Heavy Weapons Stormtroopers and elite Purge Troopers. With his lightsaber, Kestis was able to defeat these assailants as well. After emerging from the temple, two AT-STs assailed Kestis. Kestis proceeded to destroy these walkers and safely reach the Stinger Mantis, where Junda congratulated him on his success."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Duel on Dathomir"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Kestis' lightsaber acquisition, the crew of the Stinger Mantis traveled back to Dathomir with their original goal in mind. Kestis had initially visited the planet to retrieve an Astrium that would unlock the vault on Bogano, where Cordova's holocron was located. Kestis used his lightsaber to cut through the various sentient and non-sentient locals that opposed him, eventually making his way back to the Tomb of Kujet where the Astrium was housed. Inside the tomb, Kestis was confronted by Merrin, a native Nightsister. To convince Merrin that he wasn't a threat, Kestis gave her his lightsaber, expressing to her that a lightsaber was not what made a Jedi. Merrin told Kestis that an armored warrior brandishing a lightsaber had massacred her clan during the Clone Wars, before returning his lightsaber to him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having been allowed to pass by Merrin, Kestis headed deeper into the tomb until he came face-to-face with Taron Malicos, a Jedi Master who had fallen to the dark side following Order 66. Although Malicos attempted to coax Kestis into joining him in his pursuit of power, he turned hostile once Kestis repeatedly refused his offer. The two Jedi engaged in a lightsaber duel. Midway through their fight, Kestis used his lightsaber in its single-bladed function and appeared to be forcing Malicos on his back foot. However, Malicos retaliated through the Force, attempting to crush Kestis with a boulder. Before Malicos could slay Kestis, Merrin intervened, firing blasts of ichor at the fallen master in support of Kestis. The duel continued between Malicos and the team of Kestis and Merrin. Malicos was eventually overwhelmed by the pair and buried alive by Merrin's magick. Kestis and Merrin proceeded to retrieve the Astrium, and Merrin subsequently joined the crew of the Mantis."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Bogano Vault"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having retrieved the Astrium, the Stinger Mantis returned to Bogano to finally open the Zeffo vault and obtain Cordova's holocron. Like he had previously, Kestis received resistance from the hostile fauna that blanketed the land between the Mantis and the vault. Similar to Dathomir, Kestis cut through the local adversaries and reached the Zeffo structure. Kestis and BD-1 entered the vault and were able to uncover the holocron after the former experienced a malicious Force vision that failed to break him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before Kestis could retrieve the holocron, he was interrupted by the Second Sister, a member of the Inquisitorius who had been hunting Kestis since he emerged from exile. After a verbal spat, Kestis and the Second Sister ignited their lightsabers and began dueling for the right to own the holocron. Unlike before, Kestis was able to get the upper hand on the Inquisitor. However, when he grasped her lightsaber he was subjected to a dark Force vision of her past, temporarily immobilizing him. The Second Sister took the opportunity to grasp the holocron and escape the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kestis made his way out of the vault where he was beset upon by newly arrived Imperial troops, including regular stormtroopers, scout troopers and heavy weapon troopers. After slaying the Imperial troopers, Kestis was able to make his way back to the Mantis where he informed his comrades what had happened in the vault."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Mission to Nur"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Kestis was knighted by Junda, the crew of the Mantis launched a mission on the water moon of Nur to take back the holocron. During this mission, upon entering Fortress Inquisitorius, Kestis used his new lightsaber to cut down anyone who tried to stop him, ranging from regular stormtroopers to scout troopers and Purge Troopers. Upon entering the interrogation chamber, Kestis engaged in a final duel with the Second Sister, and, using his lightsaber, ending up winning the duel. As Junda attempted to reconcile with the Second Sister, who was once her Padawan Trilla Suduri, Darth Vader appeared and killed the Inquisitor for failing him. Kestis refused to surrender to Vader and was overpowered by the Dark Lord of the Sith, who began tearing the fortress apart in an effort to kill Kestis. After briefly escaping, Kestis once again faced Vader, barely igniting his lightsaber to defend himself. During this, Kestis tried to use the Force to summon his lightsaber to him, but Vader stopped him, the latter turning it on and stabbing Kestis with it. Kestis escaped with his lightsaber and Junda soon after."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cal Kestis' second lightsaber first appeared in the 2019 video game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. The color of the weapon's kyber crystal can be customized, with the possible colors of blue, green, orange, purple, yellow, indigo, cyan, and magenta. The hilt of the lightsaber can also be customized with various materials, sleeves, emitters and switches.
