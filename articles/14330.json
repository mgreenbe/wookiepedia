In response to the Separatist attack, Chancellor Palpatine authorized the Republic forces to use the electro-proton bomb, a superweapon designed by Doctor Sionver Boll that was capable of disabling armies of droids and vehicles within its electromagnetic blast radius. However, General Windu had initially feared that the weapon could potentially affect the planet's ecosystem, but the pair eventually came to an agreement at the Chancellor's urging."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the massive droid army, under the command of a T-series tactical droid, approached on the plain near the royal palace, the droid gave the command to open fire and thousands upon thousands of battle droids started to fire on the outnumbered Republic forces of.
