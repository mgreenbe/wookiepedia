The entire nest was active in the arms trade; Dutan Lee exported arms using Dutan Mining Supply Exports as a front, while Dutan Kelliv supplied shipping schedules and security procedures from their position working at SoroSuub's munitions factory in Gallisport. Unfortunately for the Dutan nest, several of their deals failed and funds went missing due to Dutana Leara, a salt addict who talked too much when under the influence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
