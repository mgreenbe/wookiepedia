The Galactic Federation of Free Alliances claimed that, as she possessed the power of a Jedi, she should have an observer. Veila, who, in the years since her redemption had become a bounty hunter, fought the accusation, and in the end the Court of Justice, headed by Chief Justice Uved Pledesin, sided with her. The reasoning behind their decision was that someone did not require an observer just because they possessed a large amount of power, because to supervise everyone with such power would not be possible. Many Jedi celebrated this decision, as it showed that Alliance Chief of State Natasi Daala did not yet have total control over the Courts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
