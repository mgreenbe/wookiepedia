Soon afterwards he had to report to Darth Arkous of Republic's own Korriban Incursion and was redeployed to assist in retaking the Sith Academy on Korriban. During the fighting on Korriban, he came upon a group of captured Sith apprentices and consulted on the Imperial strike team on whether to simply release them or force them to fight and die for the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arkous was eventually murdered on Rakata Prime while preparing Revan's Infinite Army and sources claimed that Lana Beniko was involved, resulting in a bounty on her head. Tarsten was quick to believe the claim and scorned her for foiling Revan's plan. Tarsten eventually relocated to Rishi where a large number of Revanites have gathered and began answering to Sith Lord Ivress. Arkous' killer eventually found them out and fooled Tarsten and Ivress into suspecting Republic Captain Milenec of betrayal, which eventually played into uncovering of Revan's plans on Rishi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tarsten first appeared in game update 2.7 of the MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel, released by BioWare in 2014.
