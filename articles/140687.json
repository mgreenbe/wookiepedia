It consists of 90 regular cards (45 Dark Side and 45 Light Side cards) and nine alternate image cards and was introduced in 2001. This set consists of 30 rare, 9 alternate image, 30 uncommon, and 30 common cards. The Tatooine Limited set was the first set to introduce alternate image cards to the game. These cards were identical to their original version but they just had a different image and were rarer thus adding a new element of collectability to the game. Cards that were usually made into alternate image cards were main characters. This set introduced many of the classic characters from Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace that were involved with the events occurring on Tatooine. This set also introduced podracing to the game, in which players could relive the excitement of podracing. A complete list of the Tatooine Limited set can be found on the players committee's page."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because this is an expansion set, it bears an expansion-set symbol, which is located near the top right corner of the card to the right of the lore and below the destiny number.
