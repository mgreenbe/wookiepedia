When Marg rejected the Black Sun syndicate's offer to merge their two syndicates, the Black Sun's leader Ziton Moj ordered the kidnapping of Tezzka and her children to force Marg to reconsider his decision."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ziton brought Tezzka and her children to the Black Sun fortress on Mustafar where they were imprisoned in a \"house\" at the top of the tower which dominated the fortress. At some point during their captivity, Tezzka was forcibly separated from her children by Ziton's burly Falleen guards and brought into Ziton's palace. Later, Laalee and Vram were rescued by the bounty hunters Asajj Ventress and Quinlan Vos, who had been hired by her husband to rescue Tezzka and her children.

After securing the children, Ventress and Vos hatched a plan to rescue Tezzka. Their rescue mission was timely because Ziton had just learned about the children's escape and had issued orders to execute Tezzka as a warning to Krim. Before Ziton could kill Tezzka, Vos managed to rescue her.

According to Vos, who saw a glimpse of the struggle through his psychometric powers, Tezzka fought like a nexu defending her cubs. Despite her efforts, she was no match for the big-built Falleen, who took her to Ziton's palace.
