His nephew, Kako Fantanine, was the administrator of a mining colony owned by the Fantanines. When Kako became too incompetent to run the facility, Fantanine searched for an outsider that could dismiss him and take care of the operation for some time. On Burnin Konn, he tracked down Baron Administrator Lando Calrissian of Cloud City, offering him ownership of the mining colony in exchange for removing his nephew from power. Calrissian took the offer, but later discovered that the Fantanines were exploiting the native species of the planet and sabotaged the operation. Fantanine withdrew the offer and the funds he had sent to Calrissian."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
