When Cole Fardreamer, R2-D2 and C-3PO traveled to Telti, the source of the droids with implanted detonators that Kueller was using against the galaxy, Cole was captured by Brakiss, who was commanding the facility, and was sent to be interrogated by EV-9D9.2. R2 rallied a large number of old astromech droids that were in storage on Telti and had them attack the Red Terror, a group of modified gladiator droids that guarded the moon. Although the Red Terror destroyed many of the astromechs, their numbers were large enough to overwhelm and destroy them. R2 and C-3PO were able to find Brakiss's remote, deactivating Kueller's detonators, while the astromechs chased Brakiss to his shuttle and forced him to flee."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
