The sentient carnivorous plants had emerged across the Galactic Frontier several months earlier, prompting an alliance between the Jedi Order and the Hutt Clan to combat them. Jedi Master Avar Kriss and the Hutt warrior Myarga led forces to Daivak to combat the plant monsters. After Kriss called for reinforcements from the Starlight Beacon, Jedi Knight Keeve Trennis and Master Sskeer were able to enter the Drengir Root Mind and discover the location of the Great Progenitor, the first Drengir, which pained the plant creatures and forced them to retreat. As a result, Kriss next planned an assault on the Drengir rootworld to bring an end to the threat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
