Piru, who had been critically injured, was healed by K'Kruhk and the two then attacked the pirates, rescuing the younglings. K'Kruhk, however, did not act Jedi-like, and, out of fear of being a constant reminder to the younglings for his actions, promised to take them off the moon as soon as he could."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
