In 3 ABY, he was among the Alliance Military forces stationed in Echo Base, the Alliance's secret headquarters on the planet Hoth. The naturalist Kell Tolkani was amongst the base staff that served under Tigran's command. At one point, Jamiro spoke with Princess Leia Organa in one of the hangars of the base concerning the fact that the planet's dropping temperatures had caused the engines of all the Alliance's speeders to ice over. She gave the order to Jamiro that all snowspeeders would remain grounded until the issue was fixed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Jedi Luke Skywalker failed to return to the base after going to investigate what he believed to be a meteor, Jamiro was working as deck officer. The officer and his assistant then rushed into the tauntaun chamber near the base's north entrance, where Jamiro approached Skywalker's companion, Han Solo. The officer reported that Skywalker had not returned through the base's south entrance, but speculated that he may simply have forgotten to check in. Solo dismissed this idea and asked Jamiro about the readiness of the base's speeders, but when the officer reported that the vehicles had not yet been adapted to the cold, Solo prepared to ride out on a tauntaun before anyone could protest. An assistant officer then stated he would cover sector twelve and set communication control to screen alpha."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Hoth"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon seeing Solo prepare to ride out, Tolkani warned Tigran that Solo would need to monitor his tauntaun's vitals carefully if the pair were to survive, as temperatures were rapidly dropping while night fell, meaning the creature would freeze. Hoping to maintain some control of the situation, Jamiro called after Solo and loudly repeated an abbreviated version of Tolkani's warning, stating that his tauntaun would never survive outside the base. Solo disregarded the warning and rode out alone. Neither Solo or Skywalker returned to the base that night, but both were discovered alive and rescued the following morning."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after their return, the Empire arrived in the Hoth system and began attacking Echo Base. Jamiro informed a group of the base's scientists and mechanics, including Tolkani, of the Empire's arrival, letting them know that their evacuation slots had been assigned. He reassured them that they would likely survive the evacuation, but advised them to write any final messages they wanted to send before leaving, which would then be encrypted and sent throughout the entire fleet to ensure their delivery if anyone managed to escape Hoth. Before finishing, he informed the group that it had been a pleasure to serve with them and hoped that the Force was with each of them no matter where they ended up. Tolkani chose to remain on Hoth to continue studying the native wildlife and mentioned Jamiro in a message that was intended to be sent to the naturalist's parents, explaining the decision. Jamiro was then among the personnel that took part in the battle, and although the Alliance was defeated by Imperial forces, the rebels managed to successfully evacuate much of the base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jamiro was aghast at Solo's plan to ride out on a tauntaun and considered it pure madness. When informing the scientists and mechanics that the Empire had arrived, Jamiro's voice was resigned and not as strong as Kolkani believed he probably would have liked. When saying farewell to the group, Jamiro's eyes filmed with tears, but his voice showed no sign of them.
