The creature had a singlular eye, a large mouth, and numerous tentacles. While searching for the secrets of his master, Emperor Palpatine, the Sith Lord Darth Vader encountered the creature after exiting hyperspace before the Red Honeycomb Zone on his way to Exegol. The Sith assassin Ochi of Bestoon, trapped in an escape pod held beneath Vader's Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor, urged him to jump to hyperspace, but Vader refused, intending to face the creature. He then proved himself able to tame and control it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Vader tamed the beast, he made it approach Exegol.
