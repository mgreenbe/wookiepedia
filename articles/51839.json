At the Battle of Coruscant in 27 ABY, Supreme Commander Sien Sovv had positioned three Fleet Groups in the system, representing the entire augmented strength of the First Fleet, Second Fleet, and Third Fleet commanded respectively by Admiral Traest Kre'fey, General Garm Bel Iblis and General Wedge Antilles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "All the senior commanders survived the battle: Sovv subsequently reappeared at Mon Calamari, while Kre'fey regrouped at Kashyyyk, Bel Iblis organized a defensive posture around the major shipyards at Fondor and Tallaan in Tapani sector, and Antilles moved first to Borleias and then Kuat. Of course, in the aftermath of the tactical and strategic rout of the Defense Force and the collapse of the Galactic government, the forces which had attached themselves to each commander bore little relationship to the former order of battle, but by 29 ABY, the old Fleet designations were once more being applied to the forces under their command."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At this time, the old designation of the Fourth Fleet was also revived, although it is unclear how much of the old Fourth Fleet had survived to be regrouped into what was now essentially the front-line fighting force of the Imperial Navy under its Supreme Fleet Commander, Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon.\nElements of these four fleets were heavily involved in the defense of Mon Calamari and the reconquest of Coruscant. The fate of the old Fifth Fleet is unclear: it had been guarding Bothawui in the last years of the New Republic, and the designation is not heard of again until the time of the Swarm War, by which time it was commanded by the young Bothan Admiral Nek Bwua'tu. The Fifth Fleet had evidently undergone some reorganization in the interim, as the fleet flagship was the post-war Star Destroyer Admiral Ackbar, and the Mon Mothma, former flagship of the Third Fleet, had been assigned as the command ship of a subordinate task force commanded by Commodore Gavin Darklighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Alliance's shipbuilding machine had been pushed into overdrive at the peak of the Yuuzhan Vong War, and thus by the time of the Swarm War the Defense Fleet had swollen to Nine Fleets. Sien Sovv administered an enormous reorganization of the Defense Force, which involved the construction of General Crix Madine Military Reserve in the Coruscant system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Capital ship classes"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battleships"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battlecruisers"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Destroyers and cruisers"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Carriers and assault ships"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Frigates and escorts"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Corvettes and gunships"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Starfighters"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Support craft"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known ships"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Units"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Commanders"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
