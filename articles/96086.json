Following the Separatist invasion, a blockade of thirty warships was established in the planet's orbit under Harch Admiral Trench to prevent Republic interference. Sometime later, the Republic dispatched a fleet under the command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker to break through the blockade and deliver relief supplies to Senator Bail Organa, who was trapped on the surface as a result of the blockade. However, Skywalker and his fleet were ordered to retreat behind the moon of Leesis by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who arrived in the system aboard the Negotiator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After their retreat, Skywalker left his flagship for the Negotiator, where he was greeted by Kenobi. While on board, Kenobi showed Skywalker a prototype stealth ship, with which the latter would use to continue the supply run to Senator Organa.
