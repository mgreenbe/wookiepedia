Around 21 BBY a male Ugnaught technician, Erk Zallis was working at this chamber. Before the mission to the Citadel, an infamous Separatist's prison, several Jedi and their clone troopers were carbon freezed to infiltrate safely into the planet Lola Sayu. Because Osi Sobeck, a warden of the Citadel, and his tactical droid K2-B4 scanned every ship toward the prison for lifeforms, the Republic elite team had to avoid the scan by being frozen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
