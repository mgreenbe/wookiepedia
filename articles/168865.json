However, it would fade from its glory after the Old Republic declared slavery illegal, the Jedi cracked down on their slaving operations and liberated countless beings from bondage.

Dooku has convinced the governor, Gupat Roshti, to be taken to a \"safe haven.\" Dooku and Zygerrian Prime Minister Atai Molec then contacted him as he negotiated with Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi. Dooku then ordered D'Nar to bring Kenobi to him on his knees. Scintel went on to order him to return Kenobi with them to Zygerria so they could be sold at auction in hopes of expanding their slave empire. To this end they began an invasion of Kiros where the Confederacy supplied them with the captured Togruta population, whom the Zygerrians hoped to sell by bringing back the royal slave auction, a tradition of the old Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, their plans were foiled by the Jedi who located the missing colonists, and sent Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Padawan Ahsoka Tano undercover to infiltrate the slavers' auction on Zygerria, where Skywalker and Tano posed as master and slave. Tano later threatened Scintel, but the queen had already outfitted the girl's neck with a shock collar, which she then remotely activated, electrocuting Tano unconscious. Skywalker and Kenobi were captured too. At this point, Scintel had started developing feelings for Skywalker and decided not to kill him which Molec saw as a weakness and invited Dooku to Zygerria to speak with the Queen about her defiance in not killing Skywalker. When the Queen again refused to kill him, Molec and Dooku decided to take matters into their own hands, seeing Scintel unfit to be queen. Molec then stood by as Dooku Force-choked her.

Later when Galactic Republic reinforcements led by Admiral Barton Coburn and Jedi Master Plo Koon landed on Kadavo, they confronted the slavers, with the Wolfpack detachment attacking the facility with LAAT/i gunships and clone Z-95 starfighters. However, although they were initially halted by its ray shields, Skywalker was able to destroy the defensive towers. Meanwhile, Kenobi and Rex rebelled and killed Agruss who in a last act, tried to throw the Togruta hostages into the volcanic crevice below the facility, but, following a plan devised by Tano, the Republic forces evacuated everyone onto Admiral Coburn's Arquitens-class light cruiser Hand of Justice. The Republic strike team then destroyed the slave facility, with its destruction dealing a crippling blow to the Zygerrian slave trade."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial Era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the defeat of the Separatist-aligned Zygerrian slave trade, a Zygerrian named Raney came to command a remnant of the empire; his forces were made up of a YV-865 Aurore-class freighter and an encampment\u2013staffed by Zygerrian soldiers and his pet Brezak\u2014in the ruins of Old Ord Mantell City on the planet of Ord Mantell. The Clone Wars would also come to an end, as the Confederacy collapsed after the deaths of its leaders, while the Republic was transformed into the Galactic Empire. Understanding that the laws concerning slavery could be different under a new regime, Raney and his troops took advantage of the Republic's fall, taking captives to restore the Zygerrian regime.

Ordering their youngest member\u2014the enhanced clone Omega\u2014to stay back at their ship, the Havoc Marauder, the commandos attempted to attack the encampment, only for the Brezak to attack CT-1409 \"Echo,\" revealing the presence of the team. The commandos were captured to be made into slaves, and two Zygerrian guards searched through the Marauder but found nothing, as Omega remained hidden and GNK-series power droid Gonky pretended to simply be a box.

Afterward, Omega would claim a Zygerrian energy bow, and clone commando \"Wrecker\" began to fight Muchi in order to convince the rancor to follow them.
