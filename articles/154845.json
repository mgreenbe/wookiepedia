During the Second Battle of Onderon, this Lord, with three other Sith Masters, attempted to perform a ritual around a dark side nexus to aid Onderon troops. When confronted by the allies of Jedi Knight Meetra Surik, the Lord tried to persuade them to join the dark side under his teaching. He failed and said that they had chosen death instead of power.
