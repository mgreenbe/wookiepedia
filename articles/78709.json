Tur-Mukan noted that he kept it in a bag in his belt instead of in his pack and was touched by the gesture, realizing that since the soldier was usually only issued ration cubes he had few opportunities to eat foods such as kuvara, and ordered RC-1136 to eat the kuvara himself. He readily exhibited his enjoyment of the food as he savored it with his eyes closed. Later in the mission, the commandos used dried kuvara in a stew with merlie."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kuvara appeared in the 2004 novel Republic Commando: Hard Contact, written by Karen Traviss."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
