A saber's blade was emitted out the handle through the emitter matrix which kept a tight magnetic grip on the beam and allowed it to reliably extend to a predetermined length. A lightsaber would explode shortly after ignition if the emitter matrix was inverted - a tactic used once by Petro, a Jedi initiate, to subdue a group of pirates."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
