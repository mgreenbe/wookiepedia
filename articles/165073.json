When in full bloom, the wuppa had bright flowers of red and violet. These flowers were similar in appearance to the head tresses of the sentient Ho'Din species, such that the reptilian species resembled giant wuppa plants. In addition to its blooms, the wuppa took the form of tall grasses. Slender Ho'Din such as the smuggler Par'tah often resembled swaying wuppa grass."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The wuppa plant was created by Troy Denning for the first edition of the Galaxy Guide 4: Alien Races, published by West End Games in 1989."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
