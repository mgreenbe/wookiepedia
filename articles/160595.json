As the Skywalkers passed the junction, Vestara and Walusari launched a set of grenades at the Jedi. Xal had planned with his apprentice to execute his betrayal at that moment; he and Raas Force-pushed the grenades back at Vestara and Walusari before turning to attack the Jedi themselves.

The Pool then showed Tahv and the Takara Mountains, and Gavar quickly moved to attack Ben, suspecting that the Jedi were trying to discover the location of the Sith homeworld. Luke pushed the Sith Saber away, but Taalon suddenly saw a Jedi queen upon the Throne of Balance within the Pool, and, fearing that she could prevent the Sith's planned invasion of the galaxy, demanded to know who she was.
