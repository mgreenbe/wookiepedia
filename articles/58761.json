After they stole ships from outside of Maz Kanata's castle, she asked Han Solo and Chewbacca to pose as buyers to find out where they operated from. The Hackjackers kidnapped the two smugglers, having learned what they were doing. After seeing them get kidnapped, the pirate Hondo Ohnaka tried to steal their ship, the Millennium Falcon, finding that Kanata was aboard, planning to rescue Solo and Chewbacca. Ohnaka, who had planned to buy from the Hackjackers, agreed, locating their base and infiltrating it.
