They were unique to them, whereas the general populace like Goethar Kleej and Qohn did not have them, nor did the minions in specialized roles like Dace Golliard. Tattoos on the arms of members of the Crucible were usually a reference to military insignia, representing rank and the particular group of trainees a minder is assigned to. Some members, such as Chantique and Jarael, were known to bear the Flames of the Crucible on their faces. In Jarael's case the tattoos actually meant \"Protector,\" the name that was given to her by the slaves of the Crucible."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
