Soon, Asajj Ventress appeared with battle droid guards. He and his fellow guard feared Ventress posed a threat, so they raised their blasters. However, Katuunko wasn't worried at all. When Ventress was ordered to kill the king after he chose to join the Republic, the two guards tried to defend him, but Ventress merely Force pushed them, subsequently knocking them unconscious. They soon awoke to find Ventress gone, and joined Yoda, his troops, and Katuunko in boarding a Republic gunship with a new alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
