Sometime prior to 27 BBY, they approached the cloners of Kamino to produce Human soldiers for infiltration squads. The clones the Kaminoans produced were deliberately genetically-engineered to be sterile, though it was found that the clone prototypes displayed much higher rates of mental instability, poor unit cohesion, an inability to adapt and think creatively, and decreased aggressiveness in battlefield simulations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kaminoans attempted to redress the problem with synthetic hormones, rewiring cortical pleasure centers and dietary additives, but all cases improvement was minimal. The Puralan experiment led Senior Research Geneticist Hali Ke to recommend that leaving Human clones with the ability to reproduce was the only way to guarantee effective, aggressive soldiers. The lessons of the Puralan experiment were applied in the Kaminoans' project to create the clone troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
