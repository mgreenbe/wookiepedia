He took a seat at an empty table and, after being served by a waitress, was joined by the Advozse Bom Vimdin, who later left and was replaced by the Rodian Bludlow. As Dratun and Bludlow sat drinking, an officer of the Galactic Empire appeared on the cantina's wallscreen and announced that a curfew was being imposed on the entire Tatoo system. When the Human bartender Ackmena attempted to usher everyone out, Dratun was one of several patrons who responded by throwing garbage at her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Ackmena's further appeals failed, Dratun and Bludlow joined in a cantina-wide call for one more round of drinks, which the bartender reluctantly obliged them. She sang the song \"Goodnight, But Not Goodbye\" while serving her intoxicated customers, and when she called for everyone to follow her, Dratun and Bludlow joined in a dancing line and waltzed out the front door. The evening's events were recorded and broadcast throughout the galaxy as a program called \"Life on Tatooine,\" which was required viewing for all members of the Imperial forces. The program was shown with the hope that its viewers would be uplifted by a feeling of superiority over the cantina's lowly denizens."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dratun initially refused to leave Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina despite the issuance of an Imperial curfew, and he responded to Ackmena's insistence that he depart by throwing garbage in her direction.

Several of the alien masks used in the scene were recycled from the cantina set of 1977's original Star Wars film, which featured two Gotal characters: Feltipern Trevagg and an unnamed Gotal. As Dratun's hair is of a different color than either of those Gotals, Star Wars authors Tim Veekhoven and Kevin Beentjes have postured that his mask was either altered from its appearance in the original film, or created anew. The Gotal mask used in the original film was created by makeup artist Rick Baker, as were all of the costumes created newly for the Holiday Special's cantina scene. Filming of the latter took twenty-four hours, and some of the actors in alien suits passed out due to a lack of oxygen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 2000, Star Wars Insider 48's edition of the recurring Insider feature \"The Last Page\" used a picture of the then-nameless Holiday Special Gotal to represent Trevagg.
