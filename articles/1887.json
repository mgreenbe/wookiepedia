During the Clone Wars, 79's catered to the clone troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic who would party and blow off steam while off duty. 79's was known on Coruscant to be a clone bar; however, non-clones would also frequent it. ARC trooper Fives had taxi pilot Jay Igno take him to 79's where he met his friend Kix to ask for help after Fives discovered the Order 66 conspiracy. Fives fled when the Coruscant Guard shock troopers arrived to search for him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
