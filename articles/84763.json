This distinctive black-and-silver weapon was powerful and highly accurate in the right hands, and all Guardsmen were trained in rifle proficiency as new recruits. The blaster also carried a stun setting and a stun prod useful for crowd-control situations. Although designated as \"ceremonial\" weapons, these rifles saw increased use during the latter decades of the Republic's rule. Capable of both single-shot and rapid-fire, they were equipped with collapsible stocks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Galactic Civil War, the rifles were largely stored in the armories deep within the Imperial Palace.
