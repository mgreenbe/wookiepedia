On the planet Bescane, a scenic replicator was a common site in the Arcade Omicron cantina. The device would be used in small side rooms that branched off of the cantina's main hall. The side rooms would then be transformed into the image of the desired planet through the use of hologram technology. Among the many scenes present on the replicator were the swuvehorn clubs of Fegorosk IV, the ice geysers of Hoth, the forests of Kashyyyk, the bridge of a Star Destroyer, the mountains of Ryloth, the desert wastes of Tatooine, and the tropical seashores of Wroona."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
