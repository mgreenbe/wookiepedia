When Luke Skywalker burned Vader's armor on Endor, only the charred and twisted remains of the partially molten helmet, along with ashes and small pieces of metal and plastoid were left behind in the funeral pyre. Clone trooper armor consisted of a set of form-fitting plastoid plates worn over a black body glove. Stormtrooper armor was made of a plastoid composite. Stormtrooper armor was meant to be impervious to chemical warfare and had an air filter in the helmet and a built in oxygen tank, but it was vulnerable to direct blaster fire. Plastoid was used in the construction of certain Separatist droids. Plastoid armor was worn by Ap'lek, a member of the Knights of Ren."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
