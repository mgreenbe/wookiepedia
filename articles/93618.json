After the Battle of Yavin, Krieg and Doctor Edvar Vang discovered the existence of a new kind of spice. This spice was trafficked by the Rebel Alliance but was also sought by the powerful criminal organization Black Sun. Krieg decided to investigate the source of the spice but was finally assassinated. Around 1 ABY, a group of spacers discovered a sample of the new spice while looking for a missing pilot, Cal Handro. They brought it to Doctor Vang but the latter exhorted them to interrogate Krieg instead of him. The spacers only found the corpse of Moxxar Krieg in his house."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moxxar Krieg's house was a location in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts.
