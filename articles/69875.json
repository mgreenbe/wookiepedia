It taught its followers to not give in to feelings of anger toward other lifeforms, which would help them resist fear and prevent them from falling to the dark side of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amongst other dictates, the Jedi Code forbade Jedi Knights and Jedi Masters from taking on more than one Padawan at a given time; and forbade Jedi from forming attachments. Grand Master Yoda stressed that emotional detachment was essential to prevent Jedi from becoming vulnerable to feelings of jealousy, greed, and the fear of loss, all of which were paths to the dark side. Ahsoka Tano also regarded attachment as dangerous, and rejected Grogu as an apprentice due to the foundling's bond with the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin. This practice of non-attachment did not mean the Jedi were strangers to compassion, as they considered it central to their way of life and believed all lives were precious, though outsider misunderstandings of this were not unusual. While Jedi did not marry, the Jedi Code banned neither romantic feelings nor familial love. The code forbade the Jedi from killing unarmed opponents as well as seeking revenge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, there were those in the Grand Army of the Republic, such as Wilhuff Tarkin, who believed that the Jedi Code prevented the Order from doing what was necessary to win the war against the Confederacy of Independent Systems.

Attachment was the inability to accept change as the fundamental characteristic of life; to accept death as the natural part of life; the inability to let go. Feeding into fear of loss and greed, leading to jealousy, attachment was selfish, a shadow of greed and thus a path of the dark side of the Force. Therefore, attachment was forbidden for a Jedi, who had to train themselves to let go of everything they were afraid to lose; to renounce all attachments. Thus, they could be compassionate and loving and caring, but not be possessive and grabbing and holding on to things, trying to keep them frozen in time, accepting the transitional nature of life. This allowed them to love the totality of life unconditionally without selectively choosing individual life-forms to become selfishly attached to."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Personal Relationships"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Members of the Jedi Order considered each other their family and sometimes were truly related by blood. Jedi Masters developed strong, trusting and loving bonds with their apprentices whom they raised, being like a parent to them. However, they were not supposed to form attachment - for the greater good, they had to be able to let go of them, to not to lose a thousand lives just to save one. The Jedi considered romantic feelings natural and as such, they did not prohibited them, but for a Jedi Knight it was essential to make the right choice for the Order and not neglect their Jedi duties in the favor of their beloved, even if that would mean the end of the relationship."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Emotions and serenity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi were encouraged to rely on their instincts over their mind.

They had a strong faith in the Force and found comfort in knowing that upon dying, they, just like all things that ever lived, will be transformed into the Cosmic Force, the wellspring from which the Living Force emanated, becoming one with it. Therefore, they saw death as the natural part of life; despite they were saddened by it, they were advised to remember, one day they will all pass on, and rejoice and celebrate those around them who passed away and become one with the Force, instead of grieving and missing them.

It was there accompanied by a set of practical rules, more akin to a code of conduct, such as not acting for personal gain or trying as hard as possible to preserve life (while acknowledging that killing may at times be necessary). While the \"mantra\" part of the code lived on in later material, the code of conduct passed into obscurity. The \"Emotion, yet peace\" version of the mantra first showed up in the roleplaying game sourcebook Tales of the Jedi Companion from 1996.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi teaching on not forming attachments was misunderstood and misinterpreted in a number of Legends materials using \"attachment\" in terms of fondness, affection, love or loving commitment, making the misstatement that the Jedi were forbidding these emotional bonds. On the contrary, George Lucas explained, the Jedi were trained, allowed and expected to love people, even their enemies, the Sith, but they were not supposed to form attachments, because attachment led to the dark side of the Force. When one possessed or had some other attachment to something\u2014be it pleasure, a person or experience\u2014one became afraid to lose it. The fear of loss fed into greed; an attached person was selfish and unable to let go. This turned into anger, which would lead to hate, and hate would lead to suffering, mostly on the part of the one who was selfish, because then one would spend their lives being afraid rather than actually living. But compassion was caring and giving and thus it was love, but the opposite of attachment; it was everlasting joy, devoid of fear of loss and the pain of loss. \"As long as you love other people and treat them kindly, you won't be afraid.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "George Lucas, identifying himself as Buddhist Methodist or Methodist Buddhist, stated that his philosophy depicted in his movies was influenced by the fact that he was from San Francisco, the \"Zen Buddhism capital of the United States.\" In 2020, he indicated that the Jedi were \"designed to be a Buddhist monk who happened to be very good at fighting.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
