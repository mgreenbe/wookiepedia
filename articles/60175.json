In the message, Kloth relayed that a crew sent to scavenge repair parts from a nearby derelict Star Destroyer returned with a strange infectious disease and were quarantined. Furthermore, the only thing the team could say to explain their condition was the word \"Blackwing.\" The letter was recovered aboard Purge after its occupants were decimated by the plague so it is unlikely that it reached him before it was released to the public for academic purposes in relation to the history of Purge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
