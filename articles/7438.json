Turned over to the Empire of Darth Revan during the Jedi Civil War, the world was eventually taken by the Galactic Republic. Seceding during the Clone Wars and aligning with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Anteevy was eventually annexed by the Galactic Empire following the defeat of the Confederacy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Empire began to build up its Imperial Army, the Emperor ordered the construction of the Imperial Robotics Construction Facility known as Ice Station Beta. During the Galactic Civil War, the Imperials refined the phrik alloys that were mined from the world, manufacturing specially-modified cold-weather All Terrain Armored Transports for use on frozen battlefronts. In addition to the AT-AT, the defected Imperial officer Crix Madine reported to the Rebel Alliance that the second stage of the Dark Trooper Project was likely taking place on the frozen world. Dispatching Rebel agent Kyle Katarn to handle the situation, the Alliance leaders planned to terminate the project indefinitely. Infiltrating the base, Katarn managed to set several sequencer charges throughout the facility's thermal exhaust systems and detonate them. The facility off-line, the Empire abandoned the world soon after."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Located along the border of Warlord Zsinj's Empire, the world remained neutral after his death, forgotten by the New Republic. At the outbreak of the Yuuzhan Vong War, Anteevy was conquered by the invaders and held until the Galactic Alliance freed the galaxy from the extragalactic warriors. Isolated once again, Anteevy was deep in space controlled by Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire as of 137 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
