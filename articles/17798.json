Despite the name, they provided only minimal protection from blaster bolts and other energy attacks. However, they effectively protected the torso from physical attacks such as shrapnel from explosive grenades or bullets from slugthrowers. Blast vests left the limbs unprotected, but therefore did not hinder the user's mobility. During the Galactic Civil War, protective vests came in a variety of types, with varying levels of coverage and protection. Some covered only the front part of the torso while others covered both front and back. The Mk 45 Protective Vest was one popular model. Prices for a blast vest during the Galactic Civil War ranged from about 300 credits for a simple vest to 500 credits for a blast vest which came with a matching blast helmet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
