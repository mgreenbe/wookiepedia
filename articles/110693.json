For example, infrared radiation was emitted by animal organisms in the form of heat and light invisible to humans. Stars also emitted radiation, which some species that dwelt in the vacuum of space absorbed through their skin as a means of nourishment. Signals transmitted through space could be corrupted by radiation through a process called radiation interference. A coating of chromium could reflect certain harmful radiations. Radiation Cannons, used by B1-series battle droids of the Separatist Droid Army, had the ability to fire radiation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
