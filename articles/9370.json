Observing both Ashla and Bogan, the other natural satellite, the first settlers of Tython recognized the light and the dark aspects of the Force. Later, both moons were colonized by non\u2013Force-sensitive Tythans who built stone cities there and subsequently settled the rest of the Tython system. During the final battle of the Despot War\u2014a conflict waged by Queen Hadiya of the planet of Shikaakwa against the mystic Je'daii Order\u2014many Shikaakwan pilots crashed their starfighters on Ashla, with the remains of the spacecraft being salvaged by the Je'daii after the war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 25,793 BBY, Ashla had been abandoned by the original settlers and was used as a place of exile by the Je'daii Order for its members who had veered too much to the light side of the Force.

These beliefs gave rise to a legend of the Je'daii Order which stated that the two moons were birthed by Tython from its fiery core in order to remind of the perpetual struggle between dark and light to all those who sought balance. In the second millennium following the settlement of Tython, the non\u2013Force-sensitive Tythans colonized the moons, building stone cities there, and later settled the rest of the worlds in the star system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Millennia later, Hadiya\u2014the queen of the planet of Shikaakwa\u2014sent her armies to attack the Je'daii on Tython. During the ensuing battle, many Shikaakwan pilots crashed their Pho-V fighters on the planet's moons. Following the end of the war, both Ashla and Bogan were scoured by the Je'daii for remains of the starfighters. By 25,793 BBY, Ashla had been abandoned by the settlers and was used as a place where the Je'daii would send those members of the Order who had strayed too far to the light side of the Force. Those exiled Je'daii would meditate on the moon of Bogan in order to re-achieve balance between the two aspects of the Force, while, conversely, the Je'daii who had veered too much to the dark side were sent to Bogan and contemplated the moon of Ashla.

This cutscene was later revised (as part of an update to all class introductions and planetary approaches) to show both moons, but both are depicted as light grey in color."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
