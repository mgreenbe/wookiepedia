They were gentle-tempered beasts that wandered the grassy meadows of the planet, although their massive curved tusks and their hides, that looked like an armor, could give them a fearsome appearance. People could often get near them without being threatened, but, during their mating season, grazers could become a huge menace for anyone who tried to approach them; during this season the male specimens saw every approaching being as a \"love threat\" and, as a defensive action, a single spooked grazer could initiate a charge capable of leveling a small town."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
