The planet had become a member of the Galactic Republic by 17,000 BBY and was one of the worlds that provided it with armies during the Great Hyperspace War of 5000 BBY. Around that time, the Nazzar government, which was originally a monarchy, and Emperor-King Prrit Qabaq of Nazzri, had became corrupted by the use of dark magic. Eventually, the return of Qabaq's daughter, Princess Ikree, to Nazzri from a self-imposed exile precipitated a civil war between the government and opposing rebels. Qabaq was killed in battle, and Ikree became the first queen-praefect of a new theocratic government based on the Ulizra religion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Approximately a millennium later, Crown Prince Qrrrl Toq of Nazzri learned about the circumstances of the Nazzri monarchy's downfall while researching the tenets of Ulizra. As a result, Toq decided to embark upon an unprecedented off-world journey of his own, which eventually led him to become a member of the Jedi Order. As a consequence of the principles of Ulizra that dominated the Nazzar society, over time the species became largely xenophobic and incurious about the rest of the galaxy, and following the rise of the Galactic Empire, the population of Nazzri withdrew from galactic affairs into isolationism."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nazzri was a terrestrial planet located in the Nazzri system. A temperate and verdant world with rolling plains on its surface, Nazzri was situated in the Lantillian sector, a part of the Kashyyyk Region in the Slice portion of the Mid Rim."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet lay on the hyperlane known as the Lesser Lantillian Route, which linked it to the Avenelle system as well as the Expansion Region's Vena system. By approximately 17,000 BBY, an additional hyperspace route connected Nazzri to the Gizer system, and another hyperlane linked it to the Kashyyyk system by 3976 BBY.

The hyperlanes that Nazzri was situated on during the subsequent five millennia were among those that were either neutral or contested in a long series of political conflicts that arose in that time period between the Republic's capital world, Coruscant, the planet Alsakan, and their respective allies. In 5000 BBY, when the Republic fought the Great Hyperspace War against the Sith Empire, Nazzri was one of the outlier worlds that provided the Republic with armies of relatively primitive tribal spearmen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Millennia prior to 4000 BBY, the planet's native Nazzar species formed a government that was a monarchy centered on the position of Emperor-King. That government had been corrupted at least a thousand years prior to 4000 BBY through the use of ancient rites of dark magic discovered by the last Emperor-King, Prrit Qabaq, leading to a decade of economic decline, widespread starvation, and strife, including the persecution of any Nazzar who dared to speak out against the regime."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Daughter against father"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Qabaq's daughter, Princess Ikree, returned to Nazzri from a twelve year\u2013long self-imposed exile known as boqeri. She began speaking out against the actions of the planet's government, which prompted Qabaq\u2014who was unaware of the agitator's identity\u2014to order that she be immediately arrested and brought before him, whereupon the Emperor-King was surprised to learn that the rebel had been his own daughter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the subsequent months, Qabaq and Ikree engaged in continuous verbal sparring, each condemning the other's words and actions. Ikree's arrest split Nazzri's population, leading to a period of unrest throughout the planet and eventually a protracted civil war. Qabaq ordered a planet-wide martial law, which only served to further populate the ranks of the Nazzar rebels. Ultimately, the Nazzar government's military faced the rebels in a massive battle during which Ikree was forced to kill Qabaq."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A new era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of the conflict, Ikree revealed that during her boqeri, she had discovered the Great Structure, a system of beliefs and teachings that governed the Ulizra religion. The princess proposed the formation of a new form of theocratic planetary government that would be based on the tenets of the Great Structure and would infuse the Nazzar society with a code of ethics and morals and prevent the repeat of the atrocities committed during her father's reign. Ikree then ascended to the newly-created position of queen-praefect of Nazzri, and her first act was to order the destruction of all records of Qabaq so as to prevent the possibility of anyone else using the dark rites he had discovered. One compilation of documents focusing on the last Emperor-King, however, survived the purge and came to rest in the building known as the Hall of Edification."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although initially the new government worked well, with every Nazzar enjoying complete freedom, only half a year after Ikree had assumed the Nazzri throne a fanatical noble of Qabaq's court murdered the queen-praefect.

Supervised by several teachers, Toq studied the fourteen constituent aspects\u2014known as vens\u2014of the Great Structure, spending exactly one local year on each of them. Eventually, the crown prince's study performance gave rise to rumors that he would go on to become the first king-praefect since the establishment of Nazzri's theocracy. Such hopes made Toq intensify his research, with the Nazzar believing that his homeworld's population had left behind the original goals of the Ulizra-based government and that it was his destiny to re-establish that religion's foundational beliefs and philosophy. In Toq's mind, such an accomplishment would help bring about a state of worldwide peace unprecedented since the theocracy's establishment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On one of Toq's study visits to the Hall of Edification, the crown prince discovered the volume on Qabaq. Reading through the book in two and a half days, Toq learned about the circumstances of the Nazzri monarchy's downfall and decided that instead of attempting to match the achievements of prior monarch-praefects, he needed to discover and follow his own way. Subsequently\u2014similarly to his ancestor Ikree\u2014the Nazzar left his homeworld for the first time in his life, embarking on a boqeri of his own while privately wondering whether he would ever return. Three years later, Toq encountered off-world members of the Jedi Order, a meeting which eventually led to the crown prince becoming a Jedi himself, and the Nazzar ultimately perished in service to the Order during the Great Sith War of 3996 BBY."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Isolationism"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Between 3959 BBY and 3956 BBY, Nazzri was situated in the territory of Darth Revan's Sith Empire.

Around 25 ABY, the population of the Nazzri system numbered between one and ten million."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Nazzar were nearly fanatical adherents of Ulizra, the ancient, state-enforced religion of Nazzri. The main tenets of Ulizra were: the destruction of any other philosophical or religious systems that undermined the Nazzar religion; seclusion from the rest of the galaxy\u2014since outsiders were likely to taint the Nazzar culture\u2014and the main principle, the deeming of the society as being of higher importance than any individual. The Nazzar used the laws of Ulizra to guide all of their decisions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a result, the species largely exhibited mild xenophobia, with all off-worlders being viewed as potentially ideologically dangerous and therefore often receiving unfriendly welcomes from Nazzar officials, and lacked curiosity about the wider galaxy.

The government, which by 4000 BBY had spread beyond the Nazzri system and controlled three neighboring systems, was headed by a king and fourteen praefects, or the heads of Ulizra's fourteen sects."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The king presided over the council of the praefects and commanded both Nazzri's military forces and all of its planetary security agencies. Only the praefects, however, could vote on the use of the military in offensive actions as well as introduce and vote on potential laws and changes and amendments to the state-given rights of the Nazzar. Most of the planet's population could predict the outcome of any such vote, for the praefects, like the rest of the species, adhered to the tenets of Ulizra while making their decisions."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Off-world Nazzar"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Off-world Nazzar were an uncommon sight and largely belonged to one of two categories: fanatical preachers of Ulizra that sought to spread the Nazzar religion elsewhere in the galaxy; and exiles. The latter had usually either committed a violation of one of the Ulizran moral codes, such as by the defilement of a temple, or outright rejected the religion's teachings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Very rarely, Nazzar in good standing with Nazzri's Ulizran authorities left the planet on a boqeri, a self-imposed exile of varied length, in order to seek spiritual revelations. Such travelers often found themselves drawn to adventure and tended to be nobles, scouts, soldiers, or practitioners of Force-using organizations. Overall, many of the Nazzar who left Nazzri found the wider galaxy to be too fascinating to ever consider returning to their homeworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Locations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prrit Qabaq, the last Emperor-King of the Nazzar, ruled from a palace on Nazzri that included a throne chamber.
