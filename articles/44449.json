It was made of fusion plasma which was shot into a magnetic bottle at the target. The magnetic field which contained the plasma could not hold it together more than a minute, but the speed of the energy torpedo allowed it to cover a huge distance in a short time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An energy torpedo was a kind of missile with an unlimited supply of ammunition. Lacking electronics, these torpedoes could only fly in a straight line and had to be \"dumb-fired\". The huge weight of the launcher and extended recharge time prevented the energy torpedo from becoming a standard weapon. The recharge time of a light torpedo was 30 seconds, medium ones had a recharge time of 45 seconds and the large energy torpedo launchers needed one minute to recharge. The speed of an energy torpedo was 20% the speed of light in addition to the firing ship's movement in the direction of launch."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trade Federation Vulture droid starfighters and Manta droid subfighters were equipped with two energy torpedo launchers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
