The XLT-014 carried relatively small loads when compared to larger droids such as binary loadlifters, but XLT-014 units were able to move cargo to more places due to the repulsorlifts installed in their feet. The droids had sophisticated scanning equipment for reading labels on cargo containers and manifests, but their limited intelligence sometimes caused problems for the droids' owners. During the years that the model was in production, the droids were used by small businesses, the wealthy, and corporations. Despite its intended purpose as a labor droid, the XLT-014 was also used as a servant, and in some instances the droids were modified to be pilots, helpers for mechanics, and even infiltrators."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The XLT-014 labor droid was a fifth-degree droid that was roughly humanoid in shape\u2014with two legs, a torso, and a head. Instead of arms, it had two long, flat claw appendages for carrying cargo containers. Units of the model had repulsorlifts installed in their three-toed feet so that the droids could lift cargo to places that conventional labor droids could not; the repulsorlifts emitted a blue glow when in use. The 1.5-meter-tall droids had an outer shell made of durasteel; one possible color scheme made the droid mostly yellow in color, with the sides of the legs orange and the top of the head red. The droid model was equipped with a video recorder and excellent sensors that were capable of scanning cargo labels and manifests, as well as scanning for energy readings and lifeforms within a radius of roughly nine meters. One possible color for the sensor equipped on the head was blue."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An unmodified XLT-014 could perform simple tasks such as cargo lifting, simple household chores, and menial duties in offices. While their cargo lifting abilities were sufficient to be useful, they were not anywhere close to those of a larger droid, such as a binary loadlifter. However, the XLT-014 lacked the processor required for independent thinking, and was controlled via a remote receiver installed on it. The droids of the XLT-014 model were not particularly intelligent and sometimes read too quickly, a flaw that could cause problems for their owners. A droid supervisor with the designation EV-6T6 thought that the quirk stemmed from the fact that the droids had a tendency to become overconfident. In spite of the perceived drawback, EV-6T6 viewed the droid design as long-lasting and reliable. XLT-014 labor droids were also skilled in using computers, and were equipped with vocabulators that allowed the units to speak both Galactic Basic Standard and binary."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The XLT-014 labor droid was created and produced by the droid manufacturer Publictechnic during the three decades leading up to the Clone Wars, which was fought from 22 to 19 BBY between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During that time, the droid sold for 9,600 credits and was available to licensed individuals. XLT-014 droids were frequently used in combination with binary loadlifters for cargo lifting jobs in order to save time for living workers. Besides their role as cargo movers in the distribution warehouses of corporations, the droids were frequently used by the wealthy as household servants and by small businesses for simple duties in offices. XLT-014 units were also modified by wealthy business people to serve as pilots, which was a cheaper option than buying a new pilot droid. For that task, the droids were reprogrammed and usually equipped with simple processors, hands, improved sensors, and sometimes a scomp link to interface directly with the flight control systems. Another popular modification was to program the droid as an assistant for mechanics by installing a heuristic processor for increased learning and creativity, different appendages, and diagnostics tools, as well as a storage area capable of holding around five kilograms of tools. The relatively small size of the droid also inspired some individuals to alter the XLT-014 for the purposes of infiltration by giving the droid security tools, a heuristic processor, and upgrades such as improved sensors and sound dampening for the repulsorlifts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the Galactic Republic, XLT-014 labor droids served on the cruise ship Galactic Breeze. One of the droids was reprogrammed to cause the starship's computer to send the ship to the wrong location. The Galactic Breeze went off course and was captured by a group of pirates near the planet Bestine IV."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The XLT-014 labor droid was included in the droid codex of Scavenger's Guide to Droids, a 2009 sourcebook for Wizards of the Coast's Saga Edition of the Star Wars Roleplaying Game. The book was written by Rodney Thompson, Sterling Hershey, Patrick Stutzman, and Robert Wieland. In the game, the droid was available for players to use as a template during character creation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
