Around that time, which saw the beginning of a series of conflicts between the planet Alsakan; Republic's capital world, Coruscant; and their respective allies, Celegia was situated in the Exploitation Region, which was a territory actively controlled by the Grand Companies\u2014Coruscant-affiliated trading conglomerates based along the Core Worlds hyperlane known as the Spin. In addition, the hyperspace route connecting Celegia to the Belasco system was under the control of Coruscant. The hyperlane leading to the Virujansi system, however, was among the routes that were either neutral or contested during the conflicts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the first campaigns of the Clone Wars of 22 BBY\u201319 BBY, the Republic's Fourth Sector Army was charged with engaging the military forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems in Celegia's vicinity.
