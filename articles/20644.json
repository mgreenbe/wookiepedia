She was a widow with one daughter, Dinua Jeban. However, Dinua was thirteen years of age, and by Mandalorian tradition was considered a full adult. She was part of the group of Mandalorians assembled by Mandalore Boba Fett when he met with Nom Anor to discuss the role of the Mandalorians in the upcoming Yuuzhan Vong invasion. When the Mandalorians covertly attempted to feed intelligence to the New Republic on New Holgha by sending a Jedi named Kubariet back to Republic space, Briika was fatally injured. In order to keep their deception, the Mandalorians killed two Yuuzhan Vong warriors. Briika tackled one to the ground but was impaled by one of the spikes on the warrior's vonduun crab armor. Despite the efforts of Slave I's medical droid to save her, Briika died saving the life of a Jedi. Her daughter Dinua was adopted by fellow Mandalorians Goran Beviin and Medrit Vasur."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Her name was derived from the Mando'a adjective \"briikase,\" or \"happy\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
