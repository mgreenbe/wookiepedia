It was placed under the command of Lieutenant Dalin and tasked with arresting force-sensitives on Cularin. Dalin would have them taken back to Thaereian Security Facility Number 12, where anti-Jedi drugs were tested on them. After Dalin executed the force-sensitive vagrant Borus Ferthyn after a mob tried to prevent his arrest, it led to riots in Gadrin. The Heroes of Cularin were sent by the Cularin Militia to free some of the task force's prisoners soon afterwards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
