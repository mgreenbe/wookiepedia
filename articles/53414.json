In 43.5 ABY, after a strike team failed to kill the Jedi Luke and Ben Skywalker, Vestara, the sole Sith survivor, contacted the Tribe to retrieve her from the planet Dathomir. Gavar Khai was chosen as part of the force led by High Lord Sarasu Taalon to retrieve Vestara and ally themselves with the Jedi with the purpose of confronting the dark side being Abeloth. After allying with the Jedi, the fleet waited at the planet Klatooine for businessman Lando Calrissian to arrive with an asteroid tug for assistance in navigating the Maw. Eventually, the Sith and Jedi agreed to continue their mission and wait for Calrissian just outside the Maw.

They soon learned that Abeloth had not actually died, and in their ensuing search they found a Force nexus, the Pool of Knowledge, where a duel broke out. Khai lost his forearm to Luke's lightsaber, but the Jedi fled. Khai and Taalon then sent Vestara on a mission to spy on the Jedi, pretending that she had fled from the Sith.

With the Tribe, Gavar Khai was trained in the ways of the Sith, and he completed his apprenticeship and was pronounced a Sith Saber. Khai fell in love with a woman, Lahka, and married her, even though she was not Force-sensitive. They lived in a private estate in the capital city Tahv. In 27.5 ABY, they had one child, a girl, whom they named Vestara. Gavar was present in 37 ABY during the festivities known as Presentation, when Vestara entered a competition to obtain a reptavian uvak, in which she won Tikk. 4 years later, a Sith Meditation Sphere, Ship, arrived on Kesh and spoke first with Vestara, who was at that time a Sith Tyro."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vestara was then called to the Circle Chambers in Tahv by the Circle of Lords, the Tribe's ruling council.

Gavar attempted to mask his concern for Vestara, but she was able to sense that he was troubled. At her meeting with the Lords, Vestara was assigned to be the apprentice of Lady Rhea, since she had been singled out specifically by Ship.

She also created a plan to capture the dark side Nightsisters of Dathomir. Gavar Khai was chosen to be a part of the force of eleven ChaseMaster frigates, under the command of High Lord Sarasu Taalon, to retrieve Vestara and the Nightsisters and confront the Skywalkers. Confronting the Jedi in orbit over Dathomir, the Sith formed an alliance with the Skywalkers to take down Abeloth, a powerful dark side being whom the Skywalkers and Vestara had previously encountered.

Upon their arrival, Khai, Taalon, and Sith Captain Leeha Faal met with Vestara and the Skywalkers, and the elder Jedi suggested that they utilize the technique of Mind Walking to enter the realm of beyond shadows in order to locate Abeloth.

As they headed for a cliff of the island that was hidden to the Sith by illusion, Luke lied that a barrier had suddenly popped up and piloted the Jade Shadow over it, but the Obuuri was unaware of the situation and crashed into the cliff. When Taalon questioned from where the barrier had come, Gavar suggested that it was likely a kind of Force wall, a misconception that Luke allowed the Sith to hold. Taalon began to demand that they return to shore and acquire reinforcements, but Luke suddenly dove them down toward the island, and as they neared, the illusion was broken.

When Khai killed her uvak, Tikk, he did so as painlessly as possible, because he felt the uvak had served Vestara well and did not deserve to suffer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Khai spent more time around Abeloth, she began to influence his actions, and eventually caused him to turn his back on the Lost Tribe of Sith and ally with her, despite the fact that she had killed his wife. When he was soon afterward confronted by his daughter and the Jedi, he expressed his anger and disappointment at Vestara with her choice and hurt her further by claiming that she and her dead mother would be easily replaced. Vestara, however, was able to recognize that Gavar had been changed by Abeloth\u2014his fighting style was wilder, and his emotions, which he had taught her to always control and direct, were out of control. Still, Vestara mourned his death and was deeply disturbed by having to kill him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Khai wore full black Sith robes trimmed with silver, complete with blaster-resistant armor. He was significantly taller than Luke Skywalker and had even features, dark brown eyes, and shoulder-length black hair that he typically wore tied back in a topknot. During the duel with the Jedi at the Pool of Knowledge, he lost a forearm. He later received a cybernetic replacement, and although he was at first concerned that it would be seen as a disfigurement among the Tribe, he found that the fact that it would make his arm faster and stronger than before was an advantage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Strong in the Force, Gavar Khai completed his training in the dark side and achieving the rank of Sith Saber. High Lord Sarasu Taalon considered Khai to be a strong and powerful Sith, as he chose Khai for his mission to the Maw, and later to accompany him when Skywalker suggested that they enter the realm beyond shadows. Later, after betraying the Jedi during the battle with Abeloth, Khai dueled with Ben Skywalker. Despite being confident of a victory against the youth, Khai found himself matched by Skywalker's dueling prowess."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the repairing of their alliance with the Jedi, Gavar frequently argued with Luke and threatened Ben, although this often resulted in attacks from Luke in the Force; attacks Gavar was unable to prevent or counter. He was also untrained in the access of the Fallanassi's White Current, leaving him vulnerable to the illusions set upon him by Abeloth. Soon after, when he believed that his daughter had betrayed the Sith, she was able to knock him out with a Force blast before he could act. Nevertheless, Gavar was soon after put in command of a flotilla sent to execute Operation Shieldfall. Once he was allied entirely with Abeloth, she began to influence his way of thinking, and during his final duel on Dromund Kaas, his fighting style grew reckless. As such, his daughter was able to overcome and kill him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gavar Khai was created by author Christie Golden for her first Star Wars novel, and the second novel in the nine-part Fate of the Jedi series, Fate of the Jedi: Omen.
