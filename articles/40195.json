When his masters, just captured by the Galactic Republic and Jedi Order, were transferred to the Section X of the The Tomb on Belsavis, they managed to send a telepathic message to their apprentice.\nThe apprentice hijacked the Fatality, a starship full of prototype HK-51 droids, and arrived over the planet in an attempt to free his masters.
