Only a single Smart Rocket could be fired before the launcher needed reloading. It detonated upon impact and had a blast radius of 3 meters, though maximum damage was inflicted within two. Imperial Demolition Troopers wielded modified Smart Rockets that required the user to lock onto a hostile target for several seconds before the explosive projectile would seek out and destroy its target."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Smart Rocket appears in Star Wars Battlefront as a power up and in Star Wars Battlefront II as an ability for the Aerial class on the Galactic Republic, Galactic Empire, Rebel Alliance, and Resistance teams."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
