It was a barren, rainy world of fluid mud lakes, mud plains, canyons, and mountains that hosted a small-scale mining colony. The planet was populated by impoverished Human descendants of the mining colonists and lived in settlements at the bases of the mountain chains. Starships would sink in Redcap's thick mud, so landings were made in Tyma Canyon, which ran for several hundred kilometers across the planet's surface. Travel was conducted on olai, beasts of burden originally brought from a nearby moon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In an unpublished short story by Patricia A.
