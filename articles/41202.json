Seake had been sent to wipe out the Republic colony, but the Jedi Knight learned of Seake's mission from the Imperial operative Watcher One as part of a bargain the agent made with the Jedi. The Knight was too late to evacuate the colony before Seake's arrival, but the Jedi and a companion were able to kill the assassin and the two jurgoran pets she used as war beasts, saving the colonists from execution."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3643 BBY, during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, the Sith Lord Darth Angral declared war on the Republic for the death of his son, Tarnis, and stole a number of Republic superweapons in his pursuit of revenge. Angral also tasked Watcher One of Imperial Intelligence with the capture of the Republic scientist Doctor Nasan Godera on the planet Taris.

Around the same time, a Sith assassin named Rora Seake was tasked with sabotaging the Republic's efforts to recolonize Taris, and her first target was a colony on the shores of the acidic Lake Brell."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In exchange for time to interrogate Godera, Watcher One revealed the existence of Rora Seake and her mission, and he promised to permit the Knight to come to the Imperial outpost and retrieve the scientist when their business was concluded.

Yelzrin welcomed the Jedi and offered foodstuffs and water, but the Jedi attempted to warn Yelzrin of the forthcoming threat so that the colonists would evacuate.

Irritated that Watcher One had exposed her mission, Seake ordered her jurgoran pets to attack the Knight and the Jedi's companion, and she withdrew to meditate and control her pets in battle. However, the duo ultimately fought and killed the two creatures, knocking Seake out of her meditation and prompting the assassin to draw her orange-bladed lightsaber, and she then attacked the Jedi herself. The Sith wielded both blade and lightning in their duel, but the fight ended when Seake was struck down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A relieved Yelzrin offered the Jedi some of the colony's limited supplies as a reward, but the Knight declined the offer and departed with the Jedi's companion to continue their mission.

Godera was ultimately rescued by the Knight, who delivered the scientist to the custody of the Republic Strategic Information Service, the Republic's intelligence agency."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The duel with Rora Seake first appeared in the Jedi Knight-class mission \"A More Immediate Concern\" in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare in 2011. Players only receive this mission if they have a light-side alignment, while players with a dark-side alignment receive \"An Opportunity Too Good to Pass Up,\" in which they stop a Sith from acquiring Jedi artifacts. Players can also choose to bypass the mission entirely, though as the Knight is a Republic-class character and therefore assumed to choose the options that give the most light-side alignment points, this article assumes that the Knight defended the colony. According to the game's text files, players originally were able to Force Persuade Seake into leaving, but that option was removed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
