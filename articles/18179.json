They were adorned with a scarlet crest on their head and four-legged with cloven hoofs like daggers. They could be trained to become a formidable mount capable of fighting after their rider was dead. Bloodfins were not known for their obedience off the battlefield and had a propensity to eat whatever fell in front of them in the heat of the moment, including riders. They were believed to be a subspecies of the Ghannoidal certecyes. Darth Maul's speeder was named after these creatures."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
