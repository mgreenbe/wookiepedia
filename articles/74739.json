At some point between 0 ABY and 1 ABY, he served as captain of the cruiser RS Revenge, which was stationed at an Alliance base hidden in an asteroid field. During Kazan's time at the base, the Alliance's General Ristt sent the Rebel-allied smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca on a mission to retrieve a mystical artifact known as the Talisman, which was also sought by agents of the Empire. When the mission took longer than expected, Kazan described the situation in starlog 3-24-1, an oral journal entry that he recorded from the RS Revenge's bridge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The smugglers' ship was soon located and pursued to the moon Panna Prime by the Rebels Luke Skywalker, C-3PO, and R2-D2, who were aided by the bounty hunter Boba Fett in counteracting the Talisman's unexpected sleeping virus side effect.
