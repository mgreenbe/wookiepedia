Once built, the battle droid manufactured several replicas of itself, waiting until a virus that L3 had placed in the Phylanx Redux Transmitter sent out a distress signal. When the droid received the signal, he and the rest of the Elthree Assault Team tracked down the Phylanx in the Mesulan Remnants Belt, entering a skirmish with Fyzen Gor and his Original Dozen. The droid managed to survive the skirmish, and along with a second droid, rescued Lando Calrissian from the destruction of the Phylanx. The two Elthree droids returned Calrissian to the Chevalier, explaining their purpose to Calrissian and Han Solo's team. With their mission accomplished, the first droid planned to wander the galaxy and fight crime, leaving the shuttle with the other droid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
