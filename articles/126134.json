Crafted through Sith alchemy, they were difficult and expensive to produce. Twelve meters in height, the Slayer possessed two shoulder-mounted blaster cannons as well as a single spinning blade on both arms. As a result of the alchemy, they were more capable of shrugging off blows which the Sith's organic warbeasts lacked."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
