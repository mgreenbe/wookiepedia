During the Eternal Empire conquest of 3636 BBY Zanisk and his constant companion Lord Adacin went into hiding to avoid fighting the Eternal Empire and remained hidden when Empress Acina signed Zakuul\u2013Imperial treaty. Following the death of Empress Vaylin and formation of the Eternal Alliance in 3630 BBY, Adacin and Zanisk re-emerged as leaders of an Imperial splinter faction. They set up their base inside the former Separatist stronghold on Ord Mantell and began attacking nearby systems that have declared for the Alliance. This eventually prompted the Alliance to retaliate and in defending their base against the assault, both Adacin and Zanisk were killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lord Zanisk appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne during final boss fight of \"Inferno\" Uprising."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
