As they approached it, the atmosphere, affected by the infiltrator Yomin Carr's dweebits, became increasingly toxic. The expedition had trouble returning to the base after discovering the storm, due to low oxygen rations. Realizing that not all of the team would be able to return to the base, Bendodi gave his oxygen pack to Jerem Cadmir before escaping into the jungle to die. Luther De'Ono, a friend of Bendodi, followed to beg him to not commit suicide, only to be shot by Bendodi. Moments later, Bendodi shot himself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
