This line of work brought him into contact with Angel's pirate group Culoss, who were descended from Q'anah's Marauders.

The Dromedar's distress transmission was picked up by the Gozanti-class cruiser Blood Crow. Serving aboard the ship were Senior Lieutenant Thrawn and his friend Ensign Eli Vanto, who had graduated from the Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant 18 months earlier.

He claimed that the pirates had returned to their base to find a slicer to get the ship running. Cygni also alleged that there was a bad leak in the main reactor. While the Imperials were aboard the Dromedar, Cygni took the opportunity to find out how to learn how to disengage the static locks from the tibanna cylinders.

The pirates' plan was to transfer the Dromedar and her tibanna cargo to a trading post on the planet Uba in the Barsa sector. Cygni also exacted a promise from Angel to transfer the prisoners unharmed to an offworld location.

Imperial forces also discovered that Cygni and his associates had managed to extract tibanna from twelve of the twenty cylinders that had been recovered. Cygni's escape only solidified the resolve of Thrawn and his friend Colonel Yularen to hunt down the criminal consultant. Yularen also rightly hypothesized that Cygni and Nightswan were one and the same person but disputed reports that Nightswan had settled down with a single organization.

To raise funds to purchase Vulture droids, Nightswan hired smugglers on the planet Paklarn to smuggle the stolen iridium from a mine in an underwater transport to fishing boats where they were formed into discs and placed inside grist mollusk shells.

When an Imperial taskforce led by Carlou Gendling arrived in the Umbara system, they were ambushed by Nightswan's Vulture droids, which were controlled by a ground transmitter station based on Umbara's outermost moon.

Higher Skies was tasked with gathering high-level files for data on the Empire's mysterious Death Star project.

Tarkin accepted Pryce's terms and took action against Higher Skies and Juahir Madras.

The neutralization of Higher Skies disrupted Nightswan's efforts to uncover the secret Death Star project. Despite the loss of Higher Skies, Nightswan learned that Grand Moff Tarkin was in charge of the Death Star project and that it was being done at a single location, as opposed to being spread out across the galaxy. However, Nightswan was unaware that the Death Star project also had an auxiliary site.

To conceal the doonium smuggling operations, human colonists instigated a violent land dispute with the Afe clan since the doonium vein was located under the clan's territory. Upon arriving on Cyphar, Nightswan learned that several of the human colonists were also involved in harvesting a pre-spice material that was used to produce a spice known as scarn. While Nightswan was uneasy about smuggling spice, he was forced at gunpoint to cooperate with the smugglers.

Taking these into account, Thrawn ordered his followers to protect the Afe clan's lands and to arrest the scarn smugglers. To bring an end to the dispute, Thrawn ordered his forces to destroy the scarn and the surrounding land. Thrawn's actions angered both the Afe clan's leadership and the Imperial military command, who disliked his unorthodox tactics.

This enabled the insurgents to board the station with the intention of freeing Wookiee slaves. Unfortunately for the insurgents, Commodore Thrawn and Lieutenant Commander Vanto responded to the attacks on the Sempre and Landsend Twenty-Six.

To help with Thrawn's gralloc assignment, Vanto, Assistant Director Brierly Ronan of the Death Star project, and death troopers Pik and Waffle were sent undercover to Aloxor to investigate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While on the planet, Vanto and the others were taken by the criminal Sisay and her gang, though Vanto mentioned Nightswan and posed as the dead insurgent's replacement. After recalling everything he could about Nightswan to convince them that he had in fact known the man, Vanto claimed the insurgent had made a deal with the Hutt Clan and that they needed to get to Grand Admiral Balanhai Savit to pay off part of the debt. Sisay found it hard to believe Nightswan would have entangled himself in such a way, but Vanto claimed he hadn't believed it at first too and said he simply didn't ask for details. The gang eventually deduced Vanto and the undercover Imperials were not working for the Hutts, but they were rescued from the criminals by ISB agent Dayja Collerand. A short time after Thrawn defeated Savit, who was behind the gralloc attacks and had been stealing components from the Death Star, the Chiss officer was defeated by Jedi Padawan Ezra Bridger over the capital of Lothal during its liberation, as he sent a pod of Purrgil against the Seventh Fleet. The creatures defeated the fleet and took Bridger, Thrawn, and everyone else aboard the Chimaera away into hyperspace. Later, Nightswan's dream for a more benevolent order was fulfilled with the fall of the Empire and the rise of the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nevil Cygni, also known by his alias \"Nightswan,\" was a human man with dark hair and dark, wary eyes. Due to long years working in bright sunlight, he had textured skin. Cygni also engaged in mild physical labor, leaving scars and calluses on his hands. Cygni was a well nourished man with a well fleshed face. In terms of his political and philosophical views, Nightswan regarded the Empire as a corrupt tyranny that had to be overthrown and replaced with a new order based on justice, mercy, and freedom. Despite fighting on opposite sides, Nightswan regarded the Imperial officer Thrawn as a worthy adversary who was the most competent commander in the Imperial Navy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nightswan was adept in misleading his opponents. On one occasion, he tricked Thrawn and his Imperial boarding party into thinking that he was a crew member of the freighter Dromedar as a means of obtaining information on how to extract tibanna from their cylinders. While Nightswan started off as a freelance \"consultant\" to various criminal and rebel groups, he eventually became the leader of the Batonn insurgents; who were disenchanted with the corrupt rule of Governor Restos and the Galactic Empire. Nightswan was unwilling to abandon his followers despite knowing that they were outnumbered and outgunned by the Empire and Batonn Defense Force. Nightswan valued life and once stopped the pirate Angel from killing Thrawn and the other prisoners; a favor which Thrawn reciprocated during the Batonn campaign."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite his involvement in crime and rebellion, Nightswan also had a moral code. During the Cyphar land dispute, he was so troubled about helping local smugglers to traffic spice that he secretly sabotaged their operation. As time passed, Nightswan took an interest in the Empire's top-secret Death Star project and endeavored to obtain as much information he could about the mysterious project, which was consuming vast amounts of metal and other resources. While Nightswan trusted Thrawn to keep his word to minimize civilian casualties, he doubted that the rest of the Empire would honor Thrawn's promise that there would be no retribution against his followers. Nightswan's devotion to the people of Batonn led him to turn down Thrawn's offer of joining the Chiss Ascendancy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nightswan also aspired to unite the various insurgent and rebel factions under one roof. However, Nightswan gave up due to the paranoia, distrust, squabbling, and pride among the various rebel factions. Nightswan also disagreed with Thrawn's idea that the Empire was a force for stability in an anarchic galaxy. He subscribed to various theories that the Clone Wars and the collapse of the Old Republic was engineered by outside agents. Nightswan also thought that the Neimoidians, a species prominent in the Confederacy of Independent Systems, had a severely overblow opinion of themselves and their capabilities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Skills and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nightswan was familiar with mining and metals such as doonium, iridium, and tibanna gas.
