As Horn watched, one of the animals emerged victorious, splattering tuskette blood on the Jedi's cheek, after which it screamed as Shala snapped its spine and bit off its head. The Hutt then offered a raw haunch of the animal to Horn and, when Horn refused, threw it to his men to fight over, resulting in a member of the Rodian species eating it. Horn later reflected that if he wished to, he could use the Force to perform a census of all the feral tuskettes living in the planet's city of Vlarnya. In 19 ABY, during a feast at the Hutt crime lord Popara Anjiliac Diresto's penthouse on the planet Nal Hutta, live tuskettes were kept in cages for the Hutt guests to eat as palate cleansers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tuskettes were first mentioned in the 1998 novel I, Jedi, written by Michael A.
