Sometime during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Techno Union, allied with the Confederacy, constructed a laboratory on Nelvaan that drained the planet of geothermal energy.

He was placed in a liquid-filled tank, and his body grew in size until his appearance differed significantly from that of his former self. During his transformation, the base was infiltrated by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker. The Jedi freed Harvos and his fellow warriors, though the men initially turned to attack Skywalker. Harvos reminded his comrades that anybody who would help free them could not be their enemy, and the warriors turned their rage toward their Skakoan captors, in turn helping Skywalker destroy the base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Harvos and the other males returned to Rokrul village with Skywalker, and although initially met with hesitation and shock from their female counterparts due to their mutated appearance, a child approached the men without fear, and the females had a quick change of heart, moving in to embrace their long lost loved ones.

Like his fellow Nelvaanians, he had gray-blue skin with black hair and eyes, and he sported black tattoos on his upper torso. Prior to his mutation, he had a small body, but his alterations caused his body to grow immensely, the top of his head to bald, his front teeth to protrude from his mouth, and his tattoos to disappear."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Harvos made his first appearance in Chapter 24 of the animated Star Wars: Clone Wars microseries, which aired on March 24, 2005 on Cartoon Network.
