During the Cold War, Gelss and another Sullustan, Fekk, became affiliated with Nebula's First Mate, Shinqo. Shinqo planned a mutiny against Nebula and executed it when the Auriga Fire intercepted the Cinzia. Holding Nebula at blasterpoint, Shinqo urged the Captain to contact the Cinzia, and Nebula revealed to the Cinzia's crew that they planned to board the ship. Shinqo ordered Gelss and Fekk to prepare for action, but the Cinzia self-destructed, killing both Sullustans. Taking advantage of the confusion, Nebula's droid, Clunker, grabbed Shinqo and took his blaster, pointing it at the mutineer. With the Auriga Fire back under Nebula's control, the mutineers accepted their positions under Nebula and the crew picked up some debris from the Cinzia's wreckage\u2014a navicomp and a hex droid nest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
