After the Battle of Yavin, Trussk and his slavers captured the Wookiee Arrworr and shipped him to the house where Trussk tortured him for weeks. Around the same time, the Blackscale Clan was tracking a smuggler known as Cal Handro. Trussk wanted him dead for having smuggled slaves for a rival Trandoshan clan. Circa 1 ABY, a group of spacers assaulted the house. These adventurers were investigating the disappearance of Cal Handro and suspected the Blackscale Clan to have captured him. A violent fight erupted in the building and most slavers were killed, including slavemaster Trussk. Nevertheless, the rescued Wookiee Arrworr eventually revealed that the missing pilot had never been seen there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trussk's house was a location in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts.
