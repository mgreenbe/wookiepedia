On that occasion, Prince Bail Prestor Organa, Viceroy and First Chairman of the Alderaan system, held a gala reception in the Grand Reception Room of the Aldera Royal Palace. Among the many guests were the Count Adan Dooku and his son Bron, as well as the Imperial envoy Jahan Cross. They were all welcomed by Organa himself, accompanied by his daughter Leia and her friend Winter. Following the reception, some of the invited dignitaries were offered accommodation in the palace. Officially, Envoy Cross had come to pass on the good wishes of the Galactic Emperor Palpatine. However, unbeknownst to the Organas, he had also been tasked with assassinating the Count Dooku, and he took advantage of the night that followed the gala to accomplish his plan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
