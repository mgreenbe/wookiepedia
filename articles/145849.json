Thrawn used modulated laserfire to contact Admiral Ar'alani's Vigilant, which had arrived to collect him. When four Lioaoin cruisers attacked the Vigilant on the orders of the Nikardun Destiny, Thrawn fired upon one of the cruisers in the Vak patrol boat, managing to cause significant damage during the initial confusion. After his starfighter was shot and damaged, Thrawn landed it aboard the Vigilant, which escaped from Primea."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In a final move against the Nikardun leader, General Yiv, Thrawn had Thalias and the sky-walker Che'ri return the Vak fighter to Primea along with a message regarding Yiv. As Thrawn expected, the two Chiss were captured by Vaks who supported Yiv and his message was not delivered; the capture of a sky-walker led the Ascendancy to permit a retaliatory strike. When the Vak Combine searched the fighter, they discovered an additional message from Thrawn, which warned them about the possibility of Vaks conspiring with Yiv and contained information about previous Nikardun activities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
