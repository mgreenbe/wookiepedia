The scorpion slugs liked to live among dried evergreen branches; however, prisoners such as Celot Ratua Dil often used the branches for sleeping mats. Given that the slugs had a potent sting on their tail that could cause weeks of agony for many humanoid species, their proclivity to live in the foliage forced the prisoners to frequently change branches. All the scorpion slugs on Despayre perished with the destruction of the planet by the first Death Star that occurred in 0 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The scorpion slugs were created by Michael Reaves and Steve Perry for their novel Death Star (2007)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
