In 25 BBY, Syk had come to be known as one of the foremost security experts at the Jedi Temple on the Republic's capital planet Coruscant. During that year, Syk was contacted by Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi regarding the alleged kidnapping of Gillam Tarturi, the son of Senator Berm Tarturi. Reviewing the security holos from the evening of the crime, neither Kenobi or Syk had any luck finding anything out of the ordinary with the seemingly inconclusive tapes. Later, Kenobi asked Syk to trace the comlink signal of his friend, the Senate aide Tyro Caladian, back to its source, leading the Jedi to Senator Sano Sauro, the man who had bugged Caladian's communication equipment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alam Syk was created by author Jude Watson for her novel Jedi Quest: The School of Fear, which was released on February 1, 2003."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
