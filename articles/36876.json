Having given birth to at least a single child and presiding over a family, Kee adorned her head with a matron's hood to signify her venerable position within society. Favoring a long, flowing blue robe of shimmerbird tongues, Kee accompanied Magistrate Argente to the planet Geonosis to attend a meeting between Count Dooku and an assortment of large trade and corporate leaders. During the meeting, Kee listened as Argente pledged the Alliance's support and funding to Dooku's Confederacy of Independent Systems alongside the Trade Federation, Commerce Guild, InterGalactic Banking Clan, and the Techno Union. Within days of the initial meeting, Kee and the Alliance delegation were still on Geonosis when the Grand Army of the Republic attacked the Petranaki arena en masse, forcing the Confederacy leaders to flee the ringed planet as the conflict known as the Clone Wars began."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite Magistrate Argente's wishes to maintain a secondary role in the war and work exclusively on the Separatist Council, Dooku forced him to participate on the front lines of the conflict, with Kee by his side. As Argente initiated the battle on the agriworld Ukio as part of Project Instinction, Kee counseled her superior to trust in the skill of their tactical droid named Doctor to oversee strategy and implementation of the project. Despite interference by members of the Jedi Order and the destruction of Doctor, Argente's plan was successful and the planet secured for the Confederacy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the war dragged on, Kooriva fell to the Republic as well as the other home and purseworlds of the Separatist leadership. As their homeworld's would not accept them, the members of the Council were forced to roam about space on their private vessels under the protection of Supreme Commander Grievous. Joining the Council aboard the cyborg's flagship, the Invisible Hand, the leadership of the Confederacy was sent to the sinkhole world Utapau to await further instructions. Following Dooku's death over Coruscant at one of the most tumultuous battles of the war, Kee attended Magistrate Argente as Grievous ordered them to Mustafar, a mining planet on the Outer Rim where they were promised safety. Not long after departing Utapau, Grievous was killed by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the Council took full control over the Confederacy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Council arrived on Mustafar, they quickly settled into the dimly lit command center at the mountainside Klegger Corp Mining Facility. Kee and the other aides to the high-powered members of the Council scurried around the command center, supervising strategy and battle plans from their remote sanctuary. During their stay, the Council received a communications from the mysterious Darth Sidious, the Confederacy's shadowy benefactor. Sidious promised that the war was over and that the Republic had crumbled under the Separatist's war machine. Advising the Council to remain on the planet, Sidious assured them that he would send his apprentice, Darth Vader, to watch over them. Relieved by the news of victory, Kee and Magistrate Argente anxiously awaited for Vader's arrival and their eventual departure from the inhospitable world. Upon Vader's arrival, the Council and its aides gathered in the facility's main command center to greet Vader. When Vader entered the chamber and sealed every door with the Force, it became clear that he was not there to protect them. Igniting his lightsaber, Vader savagely cut down the guards and droids flanking the doorway before attacking the unarmed Councilors and their aides. Kee stood by a bank of computer terminals with a pair of Neimoidian aides, helpless to do anything as Vader cut a swath of destruction around the room. As the Human cut down the Neimoidians in front of her, Kee threw up her arms helplessly in an attempt to protect herself, but the effort proved futile as Vader plunged his lightsaber through her heart. Moments after Kee's corpse fell lifeless to the ground, Vader struck down the other members of the Council."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Denaria Kee first appeared in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones where she was portrayed by actor John McEvoy.
