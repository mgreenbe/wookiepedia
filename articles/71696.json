In response, the Republic, under Supreme Chancellor Vedij, declared war on Corellia, a move that proved disastrous, as the Corellian military repeatedly bested Republic forces. The Prince-Admiral traveled to the Senate Building on Coruscant to personally establish the terms of peace, negotiating them at swordpoint before the Galactic Senate.
