Starting out as a model, Harris moved onto stage productions, and later motion pictures. For Star Wars, Harris' work was mainly behind the scenes; however, he has occasionally stepped in as an actor, notably portraying Bossk in The Empire Strikes Back. Harris has the rare distinction of appearing as different characters in all three films of the original Star Wars trilogy (as well as as the first prequel, The Phantom Menace), as well as playing a Stormtrooper in all three films."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the original Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, Harris portrayed Leia's Rebel Escort, as well as a Rebel mechanic in the war room in a separate scene.

Harris' body was molded for the carbonite block of Han Solo. Due to C-3PO and Bossk occupying the same scenes during Return of the Jedi, the role of Bossk was handed off to Trevor Butterfield while Harris stood in for Daniels' for lighting."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On short notice, Harris returned to the saga to double as Terence Stamp in The Phantom Menace due to Harris' resemblance to the actor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following his death in 2020, the first issue of the comic book series Star Wars: Bounty Hunters was dedicated to him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
