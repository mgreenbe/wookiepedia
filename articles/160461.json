It was a 10-meter-long energy conversion thruster which vaporized dross from mining by means of controlled fusion reaction, creating thrust, moving asteroids (such as into place for mining or out of shipping lanes). A single director could move an asteroid massing up to 50 metric tons; larger asteroids were moved by remotely linked directors placed at intervals. The directors were sometimes used to arrange asteroids into \"natural\" defense networks or to \"drop\" asteroids on unshielded worlds. A unit cost 12,500 credits and was operated by a single pilot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
