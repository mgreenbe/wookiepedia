After his ship, the Five Coins, was damaged in a race in the Sullust system, he sought corporate sponsorship from the SoroSuub Corporation, giving him the funds needed to repair his ship and continue racing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seeking to protect their investment, Oorn's sponsors refused to let him compete in any dangerous races. Having grown frustrated with the limitations placed upon him, Oorn decided to abandon his contract. After winning a race in his new ship, the Last Laugh, Oorn jumped to hyperspace and went on the run. He continued racing, taking on occasional smuggling jobs to supplement his more legitimate income, all the while avoiding the bounties placed on him by his former investors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Growing up in a wealthy family, Oorn Noth was viewed as a spoiled brat by his neighbors, while he viewed himself as a privileged being, deserving of service from others. His arrogance and desire for thrills often prevented him from returning home and reclaiming his birthright."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Oorn Noth first appeared in Oorn Noth: Racer on the Run, the first of the series of Bounty Postings articles that were posted on the Wizards of the Coast website for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game. The article was posted on the website on May 14, 2008, and was written by Eric Cagle. The Bounty Hunters series were written as supplements for the Saga Edition of the Star Wars Roleplaying Game, with some portions of the article were written as adventure ideas for gamemasters use. Therefore, how these events were supposed to take place was left ambiguous. The article also gave two examples for his ship, the Last Laugh which could either be similar to an Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor or a modified SoroSuub patrol fighter. This article was written with the reasoning that the modified SoroSuub patrol fighter was his ship, since his ship was given to him by individuals working for SoroSuub Corporation. The patrol fighter was given statistics for the game in the Saga Edition book, Starships of the Galaxy, while the article was written so that all the gamemaster would need would be the core rulebook for the game, but with a alternate saying that his ship could be a modified SoroSuub patrol fighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
