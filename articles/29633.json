The message reached Aristocra Saganu from the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force who personally arrived at the Alliance base on Odessen, revealing that Shan was on Copero under protection of Syndic Zenta from House Inrokini. Trying to solve both problems, Saganu asked the Commander to deal with both traitors. After arriving on Copero, Raina Temple from the Chiss Ascendancy and the Commander fought their way through the city, eventually reaching Zenta. After a small confrontation Zenta revealed that Shan betrayed her. Shan, who previously obtained information about Copero, was only after a holomap kept in the ancient ruins that had the location to a superweapon stored by the Sith Emperor. After Shan learned about the superweapon's location, he destroyed the computer terminal. As Shan and Valss, a Force-sensitive Chiss, prepared to leave, the Commander and Temple arrived to stop them, but Valss stayed behind to buy Shan enough time to escape. After the Commander killed Valss, they returned to Odessen and tried to figuring out Shan's next move."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Copero first appeared in The Essential Atlas, a 2009 reference book written by Daniel Wallace and Jason Fry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
