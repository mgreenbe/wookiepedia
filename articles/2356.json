The case was completely enclosed and contained rare elements from the Mon Calamari oceans that interacted with the salt in the water to create electricity. Non-corrosive elements from the Mon Calamari planet were used to create internal circuitry and external controls. The display on the computer contained micro-organisms that reacted to electrical stimulation, allowing full spectrum images and the ability to be seen up to 200 meters under the surface. Mon Calamari crystalline structures were used as external data ports. The computer was considered both functional and a work of art."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
