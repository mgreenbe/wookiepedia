During this time it was carrying a battalion of Republic troopers and as well as a team of Jedi Knights to reinforce the station when the warship was intercepted by the Harrower-class dreadnought White Nova, the command ship of an Imperial task force. Once captured by the White Nova's tractor beam, an Imperial strike team entered the warship and took the ship after eliminating the Republic forces in command of it. The ship would be later used to bypass the Republic blockade and board the Foundry prior to the arrival of the White Nova and the rest of the Imperial Task Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
