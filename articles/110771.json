During Ziro the Hutt's escape from the Republic's Detention Center and Senate Building, a red-eyed alien shot at a transport's engine, sending the ship spinning out of control. The Jedi diverted the transport away from a populated landing platform, but in doing so accidentally caused it to crash into the home of the Martez family instead. Rafa and her sister were saved by their parents; unfortunately, their parents were killed when the transport crashed. Afterwards, a female Jedi with green skin and dark robes visited Rafa and Trace, but instead of attempting to help the orphaned sisters, she told them that she needed to make a choice about the transport and that they shouldn't worry, for the Force would be with them. The Jedi then departed, leaving Rafa and Trace, who had once regarded the Jedi as heroes, disillusioned and embittered against the Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Left to survive on their own with no help from anyone, Rafa became something of a guardian to Trace, and taught her that they could only rely on each other. Rafa soon became the owner of a hangar and a laundromat, which she used as fronts while doing illegal activities. Trace became a mechanic, and they worked together to make enough money to leave Coruscant and escape from the Clone Wars. Rafa also began making some debts with people like Pintu Son-El, much to Trace's dismay."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Meeting Ahsoka"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Near the end of the war, Rafa was making a deal with Lokann and his business partner in the laundromat when her sister arrived at the laundromat with her new friend, Ahsoka Tano. Rafa was immediately dissatisfied with Ahsoka's presence due to the fact that her and Trace were so close. When Rafa agreed to fix three binary loadlifters for Lokann, Trace and Ahsoka began to work on them in the hangar. When one of the droids got loose and caused some damage, Ahsoka told Rafa that she should dismantle the droids since they were dangerous. However, Rafa said that a deal was a deal and did not mind that they were dangerous. When Rafa returned the droids to Lokann and his partner, Ahsoka was upset, but Rafa said that if she hadn't done it, someone else would have. Trace began to side with Ahsoka, which made Rafa even angrier and more hostile towards the newcomer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, a job that Rafa had lined up smuggling spice fell apart when the ship and crew she had hired backed out. Desperate for the money, she asked Trace to be her pilot and fly her ship, the Silver Angel. Trace was reluctant to become involved, but decided to nonetheless. Trace welcomed Ahsoka onboard, but Rafa suspiciously asked what her \"angle\" was by sticking with them. When Tano retorted that she was just trying to keep them out of trouble, Rafa coldly remarked that maybe she was the trouble Trace needed to stay away from. Without revealing that their job was a spice run, Rafa let Trace fly and the trio flew towards the upper levels. As they jump to hyperspace, Rafa tries to complement Trace while noting to Ahsoka that her sister was an inexperienced pilot and that is why she was not her first choice for the mission."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Job on Kessel"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Transporting the spice"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they arrived at the Akkadese Maelstrom and the Kessel Run, Tano began to deduce what their goals might be. Landing at a castle in Kessel's forested southern hemisphere, Rafa led the way as they met with Kinash Lock, King Yaruba's majordomo. As they discussed the terms of their arrangement in the banquet hall, Rafa maneuvered her way through discussions despite Trace's overexcitement about the situation and Ahsoka's questioning of what would be done with the spice they were transporting. They left to pick up the spice, and as they flew over the mines, Rafa noted her surprise at how many droid workers there are. When Ahsoka told her that they were slaves and not droids, Rafa said that the Republic would not allow slavery, to which Tano sadly remarked that slavery persisted in the galaxy despite the laws against it. As the spice is loaded onto the ship, Rafa pulled her sister aside to tell her not to trust Ahsoka. When Trace complained that Rafa never liked any of her friends, Rafa replied that Ahsoka was not family and should not interfere with their business. She reminded Trace that she got them the job and that it was Trace's job to execute as the pilot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back in space, Tano asked who they were delivering to, to which Rafa replied that they would be visiting Marg Krim and the Pyke Syndicate on Oba Diah. Ahsoka was appalled by this, making Rafa even more annoyed. When the Togruta warned Rafa how dangerous the Pykes were, Rafa said that she already made a deal with them and that they needed the money. As Tano said that business with the Pykes could end in the loss of their ship or even their deaths, Trace became alarmed. Tano suggested they take the spice somewhere where it could be used as medicine, but Rafa yelled that her debts could not be paid off with morality. However, as the pair continued to argue, Trace decided to dump the spice in an effort to avoid delivering it to the Pykes, but this earned her the ire of both Rafa and Ahsoka. As the group mulled over their options now that they had no spice and a contract with the Pykes to fulfill, Rafa and Trace decided to trust Ahsoka as she made a plan."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Imprisonment on Oba Diah"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the group arrived on Oba Diah, they were confronted by Marg Krim.

With their plan falling apart, Tano and the sisters ran back to the Silver Angel and attempted to escape. This was cut short, as several Pyke ships surrounded the  Angel and the ship was captured in a tractor beam. The trio was taken into custody and put in one of the Pyke's holding cells."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While in the cell, the three began arguing over who's fault the situation was. When Ahsoka told Rafa that she refused to let her profit of other's suffering, Rafa likened her to a Jedi. Tano entertained the possibility, but Trace told her not to kid around.

Following another altercation with the guards, Trace ran towards the holding cells, where she and Rafa collided with each other. After a brief argument, the three made it to the outside of the facility, where they barricaded the door with barrels of explosive material. During the ensuing firefight, Trace shot the explosives to defeat the remaining guards. However, due to the security alert, the bridge that led away from the facility began to retract. Rafa ran and jumped across the gap, but by the time the others got there, it had retracted too far to jump. Despite this, Trace attempted to jump, and knowing she wouldn't make it, Ahsoka subtly used the Force to push Trace the remaining distance. While the sisters argued whether to leave Ahsoka, she Force jumped across the gap, saying she was more athletic that she looked."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Getting onto the ground level, Ahsoka went to disable the gate while the sisters distracted the guards.

He recognized them, and offered to show the guards where they had gone in exchange for credits. He led them to the trio, and thus began a chase through the city's streets. While running, they bumped into a member of the Nite Owls, who recognized Ahsoka, although the three did not notice the Mandalorian. Rafa and Trace were quickly caught, but Tano managed to escape by jumping onto a civilian's landspeeder. While the sisters were being detained, Ahsoka escaped into an alley.
