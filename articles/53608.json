They could be extremely vicious when hunting or when pushed into it. To those they bonded with\u2014such as the Human settlers of Gellefon\u2014they could be amazingly gentle and affectionate. Because of this, several of the creatures were used by the Imperial forces which were garrisoned on the planet. When fighting, they liked to leap at their opponents and rake them with their sharp claws.
