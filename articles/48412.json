Such droids were used at the Peragus Mining Facility. The Exile, Meetra Surik encountered them on her travels shortly before the destruction of the Peragus Mining Facility, when HK-50 used these and various other mining droids to protect the Exile from the miners, who wished to give the Exile to the Exchange. Unfortunately, the assassin droid underestimated the strength of a Jedi, even an ex-Jedi who had severed her connection with the Force; as a result, the Exile awoke prematurely, and all of the facility's droids that had been commandeered turned on her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
