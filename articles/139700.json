The language was spoken by Thi-Sen, the chieftain of the Talz, and Medcha Wanto, his scribe. The protocol droid C-3PO was able to translate Talzzi, an ability that found use when representatives from the Pantoran Assembly attempted to broker peace with the Talz in order to end an ongoing war between the Talz and the Pantorans for control of Orto Plutonia during the Clone Wars. Muftak, a Talz who grew up on the planet Tatooine after being abandoned in Mos Eisley spaceport as a newborn, also spoke Talzzi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known words and phrases"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Talzzi first appeared in the 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope.
