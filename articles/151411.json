It was situated on a small island on the Lasay Swamp region of the Mid Rim world of Naboo. Controlled by a group of Gungans known as the Ultragungans, the lair was filled with a security force of numerous flawed battle droids, including B1-Series battle droids, blastromech droids, and a single B2 super battle droid. Circa 1 ABY, a spacer raided the bunker in order to recover an experimental Old Republic droid module: a stochastic decision chip. Thanks to the help of the Gungan Boss Rugor Nass, the spacer was able to access to the bunker and find the super battle droid that contained the droid module without triggering the self-destruct security mechanism."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ultragungan Lair appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
