If neither party could accept the proposal of the other, both chose to accept a third alternative, often arbitrarily made."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Such a compromise was made between Mara Jade and Leia Organa Solo during the Corellian Crisis. Mara, being a trader at the time and familiar with the inner workings of the Empire, and Leia being the Chief of State of the New Republic, were both familiar with the concept. They had fled Corellia and had only one ship, the Jade's Fire, but Leia wished to go to Drall, and Mara wished to return secretly to Corellia. They chose to accept an Yggyn compromise and went instead to Selonia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
