In 4 ABY, he was one of six selected to take part in a mission to the planet Akiva to investigate the Galactic Empire's presence there and search for the missing pilot Wedge Antilles. Sergeant major Jom Barell led the squad in a suborbital drop from a transport within Akiva's atmosphere, but before the group could land, Imperial turbolaser fire from the planet's surface destroyed the transport and killed two of Gahee'abee's squadmates. Barell signalled for the survivors to open their parawings, but as soon as the Kupohan activated his wings he too was vaporised. During the mission to Akiva, Gahee'abee wore carbon-lace armor and a orbital drop mask as well as his parawings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gahee'abee first appeared in the novel Aftermath, which was written by Chuck Wendig and released in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
