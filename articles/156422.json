She had a cybernetic eye and owned a remote droid that was equipped with a blade. At one point, she spotted the fledgling Jedi Kyle Katarn walking about the city Barons Hed, and noticed his lightsaber hanging from his belt. The bounty hunter confronted Katarn, and told him to hand over the lightsaber, in hopes of selling it for credits.
