The Rebel Alliance's Rogue Squadron destroyed it to raid the hub. The Empire also used one to protect prisons on Kessel. The Rebels were able to raid the prisons after the generator was disabled. The Weapons Research Facility on Fest was also destroyed by Rogue Squadron after its DSS-2 generator was destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One such generator was used by the Rebel Alliance to protect a portion of the ice-planet Hoth during the Battle of Hoth.
