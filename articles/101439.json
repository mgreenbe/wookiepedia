Twenty-five years later, she was one of four Jedi aboard the starship Vessel on a trip to the Starlight Beacon, having recently declared her status as a Wayseeker when the Great Hyperspace Disaster occurred."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the High Republic Era, Orla Jareni was taken into the Jedi Order at a young age, and became friendly with Cohmac Vitus during their time together in the cr\u00e8che. She eventually became the Padawan of Master Laret Soveral and viewed her master as a paragon of Jedi teachings. However, as Jareni grew older, she began to question the decisions of the Jedi Council. At first, her master heard her out, and gently debated her. Eventually, Master Soveral grew exasperated, telling her that a Jedi's role was to serve, and that questioning everything was an obstruction to that goal. This recrimination hurt Jareni, and she endeavored to obey rather than question, as well as not let her master down."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Eiram\u2013E'ronoh crisis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This dedication was soon put to the test when she, her master, Padawan Vitus, and his master, Simmix, were asked to intervene in the burgeoning Eiram\u2013E'ronoh crisis. It was the first mission for the two Padawans and both of them were elated to be allowed to fly the A-1 shuttle given to the team. This was because it was both a departure from more mundane tasks Padawans normally performed and a sign of confidence in their abilities. During their approach into the system, their masters were together in the passenger area of the craft in deep meditation. The Padawans detected an apparent distress call from a survivor of Monarch Cassel's ship, and Orla was the one to respond and steer their shuttle toward the signal. Master Soveral entered the cabin and demanded to know what had happened. Upon being filled in on the situation, the master grimly commented that the signal had only come from the ship, not a survivor. The shuttle was then shot down and crashed onto the surface of the lost moon that sat between Eiram and E'ronoh."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the crash, Jareni and her master were unharmed, though Master Simmix had died, leaving Vitus extremely distressed. However, their situation urged them on, and they proceeded into a nearby cave system that made up a broader network across the area. Jareni's master urged them forward to keep ahead of their pursuers and to see out the kidnapped monarchs. However, their progress was stalled by the sudden attack of a large white serpent native to the moon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They fought their way through five such creatures, with Jareni forced to face down one alone in an awkward position. She was unable to attack it properly, though it was equally unable to reach her, and she eventually broke the deadlock. She felt pity for killing the animals, who were merely looking for food. Master Soveral gently noted to Jareni that the Padawan wasn't using all of her skills in combating their nonsapient foes, which hardened Jareni to follow her master's lead. As they navigated deeper into the tunnels, Master Soveral moved on ahead, leaving Jareni to talk with Vitus. She attempted to console him over his master's loss but he proved resistant to her arguments, and they ended up walking silently for a time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Master Soveral stopped the group and informed them that they were under the kidnapper's base of operations, leading to the three getting ready to find a way up through the cavern tunnels. It was at this time that Queen Consort Thandeka was able to get her hands on a handheld communicator, opening an uncoded channel and helping lead the Jedi to their position. As the three waited to spring into action, Jareni felt an enormous urge to reject her tactical training, which called for them to move in when sounds were furthest from the door and to instead rush in and take out the kidnappers. She resisted this urge, and the three entered the space together, protecting themselves from shots thrown their way and moving to guard the hostages. Lord Isamer, however, leapt over all of them and shot at the hostages. Master Soveral cut him in half, but his shot struck Monarch Cassel, who had dove in the way of the Lasat's efforts to kill the Queen Consort. Monarch Cassel died mere moments later, and Orla Jareni was left deeply shaken by the event, questioning for many more years both Jedi decision making and whether she should follow the call of the Force without hesitation."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Great Disaster"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Discovery of the Amaxine Station"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Twenty-five years later, Orla Jareni was now a Jedi Master and had largely come to terms with the events of the Eiram\u2013E'ronoh crisis. She felt that certain decisions of the Jedi High Council were wrong and that she should be allowed to fully trust in her own feelings. As a result of this, she anointed herself as a Wayseeker and sought to leave the Core to instead travel to the frontier of the Republic. The first step in this new life was to travel to the Starlight Beacon, where she intended to buy a ship for herself to begin her journey. Jareni found herself accompanying three other Jedi, Padawan Reath Silas, Jedi Knight Dez Rydan, and her old friend, now Jedi Master, Cohmas Vitus, as they were all bound for the same destination. The two friends briefly commented on the change in their lives, and that they were returning to that same area of space from a quarter of a century ago. The starship that had been hired for the mission, however, was unavailable, resulting in a last-minute replacement in the form of the Vessel, crewed by Captain Leox Gyasi, co-pilot Affie Hollow, and navigator Geode."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jareni settled onto the ship, though she found the transit into hyperspace rougher than what she was used to. She also briefly pondered her decision to become a Wayseeker and concluded that returning to the origin point of her issues was likely the right choice. Due to her desire to find and buy a new ship, she considered it prudent to talk with the ship's crew on what sort of vessels might be suitable for her needs as she believed, unlike some other Jedi, that all Force-sensitives knew at least one thing she did not. The Vessel's crew also had prudent experience. However, she found herself putting off the conversation, instead making Chandrilan tea in the ship's mess, again questioning her decision. She felt that talking about buying a ship would make her choice all the more real, and she wondered aloud if she was deluding herself, and if she could find the answers she was seeking out in the wider galaxy. Realizing she was talking in the open, she agreed to keep her thoughts inner for the rest of the trip."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was at this point that the Great Hyperspace Disaster began, the event echoing through the Force and affecting all of the Jedi aboard the Vessel. The ship itself was suddenly hit with debris from the destroyed Legacy Run while in hyperspace, forcing repairs conducted by Silas and Hollow. The craft then exited hyperspace in an unknown region of space near a volatile star. Jareni meanwhile, was able to sense an enormous amount of death, which rattled her, and the Jedi all moved to the communications area to contact the Starlight Beacon. There, they learned the extent of the disaster, multiple signals from across the galaxy overlapping. However, a broadcast from the Republic cut through the panic and called on all hyperspace travel to cease due to the dangers of using it. The ship then received a message from a signal beacon, only for Jareni to advise caution, her mind briefly going back to the events of the Eiram\u2013E'ronoh crisis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The others on the bridge agreed, and they assessed the situation first, with Jareni fetching Vitus, being followed by Silas. She was shaken by the parallels between the current situation, and the crisis that had occurred a quarter-century ago. Her distress was easily sensed by both Master Vitus and Padawan Silas, but she snapped out of her mood upon the discovery of the Amaxine station, as she was given the task of readying exosuits for boarding, and arranging an order of boarding for the eleven vessels also seeking refuge on the station."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Darkness aboard the station"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the station proved safe to enter, Jareni stood with Master Vitus, Knight Rydan, Padawan Silas and crewmate Hollow to welcome apparent refugees Nan and her guardian Hague, whose ship had been rescued by the Vessel's crew and was the first to dock. However, she went back onto the Vessel after a short time, returning to Cohmac Vitus' side to ask him to delegate his roles as a leader to investigate the mysterious statues and technologies the boarding team had found. Jareni knew exactly what sort of teases would get Vitus' attention, specifically mentioning unknown languages, and the two moved off to investigate. Jareni then directly addressed the parallels to their current situation and their first mission years ago but was stopped by the sudden feeling of the shadow and accompanying chill reported by Silas and Rydan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A short time later, the pair were standing in the central sphere of the station, Jareni commenting on the muggy air and the impressive lasting power of the arboretum. She and Vitus discussed the idols, herself commenting that they might not be gods, instead monarchs or historical leaders, which Vitus did consider. However, another chill accompanying a breeze wafted over them, and the pair discussed what might be happening. Moving to check the nearby corridor, concerned a dark force was approaching them, Orla Jareni was instead suddenly sucked into an intense Force vision. She was forced to crouch to avoid being knocked down by gale-force winds, while sharp flecks of debris ripped through the air. Calling out to her friend, she pushed herself up, seeing collapsed beams of metal in the distance and an ominous glow, which filled her with nothing but horror."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She was ripped back to reality, and she rushed to find Master Vitus. She found him lying in the grass before the humanoid statue, having experienced a similar disturbing vision. She helped him to his feet, putting her arm around his shoulder to head back to the ship as he stated that it wasn't a vision, but a warning. By the time they reached Reath Silas and Dez Rydan, a battle had broken out onboard the station between the passengers and crews of the newly arriving ships, who were looting supplies, and a few were even attempting to seize others for unsavory purposes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Master Vitus able to stand on his own and rushing to action, Jareni also moved to stop the fighting, igniting her lightsaber and leaping away through the use of the Force to the station atrium's second level. After Cohmac Vitus performed an act of awe which forced the looters and combatants into compliance, Orla Jareni tended to the arm of a red-scarfed man who had attempted to kidnap Nan for unsavory purposes and had lost half of his arm due to the intervention of Reath Silas. Jareni displayed a degree of patience but also contempt for the man. After he was treated, the Wayseeker kicked him and the vessel he was from out of the station due to their violent mentality, resisting their protests by arguing that they had enough supplies and oxygen to serve their immediate needs. She then went into the mess of the Vessel."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Complications aboard the station"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, as an effort was made to breach the lower levels of the station by a small group including Nan, Affie Hollow, Dez Rydan, and Reath Silas, Orla Jareni was walking between the mysterious idols studying them for herself. While she was not a scholar, she trusted her almost primal attunement to the Force and allowed it to steer her in her analysis of the different figures, entering a trance-like state as she did so. Her analysis focused on the humanoid queen, and she suddenly concluded the figure was both defiant and defeated. The supposed bracelets on each figure were actually chains, and the revelation shocked Jareni, though she was unable to learn more following this."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She soon returned to the Vessel and witnessed Affie Hollow storm out of the ship, keeping her distance and deeming it not a good time to talk to any of the crew about starships. Instead, she sought out Master Vitus onboard the craft and entered a discussion with him once more about the parallels between the present and their shared past. However, she was shut down by Vitus, and before she could change the subject, the pair of them were thrown into another intense, terrifying vision."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The four Jedi grouped within the Vessel's tiny communication's area, Reath Silas having also experienced a vision and the need to address the threat having grown too significant to put off any longer. Jareni gave them a rundown of what they knew about the darkness on board of the station and agreed with Master Vitus' assessment of the idols as keeping a darkness sealed within, with a psychic warning seal placed over them. Jareni suggested the group consider all of the possibilities and offered that the solution was to remove the idols from the station rather than destroy them. However, Knight Rydan's comment on a possible connection between the shadow and the lower areas of the station caused Jareni to instruct him to find a way for his group to make their way down there successfully (as the last attempt had involved the station's 8-T droids attacking them, and Affie Hollow poisoned). She made a joke about avoiding being pruned to death, which invoked a laugh, something she saw as necessary to keep them away from the dark side and closer to the light."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Orla Jareni later pieced together the terrible events of this second attempt to breach the lower levels, where Dez Rydan was supposedly incinerated and resolved to push forward despite the difficulties. Cohmac Vitus retreated to his quarters, forcing her to rally the crew of the Vessel, Nan, and Reath Silas together, taking up Vitus' leadership role. After confirming that no one needed medical attention, she asked Nan to relay to the other refugees what had happened and asked that someone return the plants taken from the arboretum, as the T-8 droids were hovering at the edge of the ship's airlock, with Gyasi obliging."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She said a few words about Dez Rydan, commending him as a good man, and a great Jedi. She also said that they would search for answers about his death later, once they all had time to think about who he was and acknowledge his joining with the Force. She, unfortunately, did not grant herself her own time to reflect on what was happening with Master Vitus and Padawan Silas, who she could sense were out of balance, as she needed to determine what they were going to do about the idols."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Final preparations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after this meeting, the refugees aboard the Amaxine station received word from the Republic that hyperlanes were conditionally open, with enough information fed to starships by the Republic to allow for essential travel. Jareni met with Geode and Gyosi in the Vessel's bridge, stating that they had unfinished business onboard the station. Her statement, with the added statement that they needed to take the idols with them when they eventually left, was met with disdain by Gyosi at first, but after she assured them they would take precautions, he urged the Jedi to work their dark magic. Jareni corrected him, stating it was light magic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wayseeker Jareni then met with Padawan Silas, Master Vitus, Captain Gyoza and co-pilot Hollow in another area of the ship, where she listened attentively to the Padawan's description of Force artifacts. When he briefly suggested that these artifacts showed up more in legend than reality, she interjected that they were not to ignore legends, with Silas plowing on afterward. She agreed with Silas' assessment that the idols were Force containers, as well as with Master Vitus' belief that they should be removed from the station. The Jedi then agreed to perform a binding ritual on the idols, to make sure the darkness contained within stayed that way."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the meeting though, Jareni went to confront Cohmac Vitus, feeling he was neglecting his duties and allowing the death of Dez Rydan to impact him more than was natural. When Vitus angrily bit back, railing against the Jedi practices around death and mourning, Jareni realized that her friend's feelings were deeply entangled with the death of Master Simmix from a quarter-century ago. She carefully rebuffed his arguments, as she didn't disagree with Jedi teachings, and tried to reassure him that what had happened all those years ago was not solely his fault and that all had made mistakes on that mission. Vitus didn't accept the argument, but Jareni felt like she could pry no further. Ultimately, she was left wondering if her decision to become a Wayseeker was truly to follow the path of the Force, or if it was merely her pushing herself away from others."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after this she, Padawan Silas, and Master Vitus went into the center of the Amaxine station's central sphere and commenced their binding ritual on the idols. It was somewhat taxing, but ultimately accomplished, with Jareni quipping afterward that the hard part was now transporting the heavy statues to the Vessel."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Return to Coruscant"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon the Vessel returning to hyperspace, Orla Jareni unpleasantly discovered that she could still get motion sickness, commenting to Cohmac Vitus that it felt like they had flown into an asteroid belt as both Jedi stood guard over the bejeweled idols. Their discussion into the aftereffects of the Great Disaster on hyperspace was brief and ended with her pondering the mental condition of Reath Silas and Master Vitus, though the storm of emotions she'd sensed in her old friend had seemingly calmed for now. When a shake of the ship rattled the idols in the cargo bay, she asked what the chances would be of the darkness in the idols getting out if one fell over and broke. Master Vitus replied with the hope that they did not find out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They were briefly waylaid by a personal carrier in distress, Jareni, and the other Jedi charging onboard the ship to help get the remaining passengers to safety. She and her robes did not get any soot or damage on them in the effort, appearing immaculate, and she helped rescue Reath Silas from a terrified Wookiee child that had attached itself to him after he had saved them from the flames."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon the group's return to Coruscant, Jareni was placed in charge of transporting the idols from the Vessel to the Jedi Temple, and then through the hallways to the Shrine in the Depths. She noted with a lack of ease the effect the idols had on the Jedi and non-Jedi personnel in the hallways of the temple and overdramatically thought, as the idols were moved into the Shrine, that they were coming home. She immediately dismissed the notion and focused on helping lead their transport. A short time later, she joined Masters Cohmac Vitus, Poreht La, Tia Mirabel, and Giktoo Nelmo in surrounding the idols, and entering a deep trance. While in the trance, she had connected herself profoundly to the other Jedi, and they were all in a deep harmony that would allow them to best combat whatever darkness lay within the idols. However, upon removing the Force barrier around the idols, the group learned there was nothing present, and instead, the idols had been keeping a darkness contained aboard the ancient station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jareni was deeply dismayed at the mistake, though others attempted to alleviate the guilt she and Master Vitus were experiencing. She also grew irritated that the Force had not been precise in its warnings of staying completely away from the statues. Upon learning that the Jedi Council would delay in sending out a team to return the idols due to the continued demands of the Great Disaster's aftermath, she conspired with Master Vitus to take the idols and return them to the space station themselves. She went and hired the crew of the Vessel before also taking the idols onboard, greeting Master Vitus and Padawan Silas as they arrived, also seeking to hire the ship's crew. The group of Jedi then huddled to discuss their plan."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Return to the station"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the way to the Amaxine station, Orla Jareni confronted Leox Gyasi about the fact that the Vessel was hauling spice, which Gyasi assured her was a hundred and ten percent legal as it was medicinal. She was highly skeptical, but ultimately let it go as the Vessel and its crew were willing to go on this dangerous mission with them, but also because she believed Gyasi to not be foolish enough to directly lie to her about the cargo's legal status. Upon emerging from hyperspace, and realizing a Nihil Storm frigate was anchored aboard the station, the Vessel hid from the much larger ship, but there was still the question of how to board the station. Jareni then joined Affie Hollow, Cohmac Vitus, and Reath Silas in getting into exosuits to do just that. Jareni also decided to allow Hollow to perform her own mission onboard the station, as she did not wish to use force to stop her. The group then exited the spacecraft and used their thrusters to reach the airlock, with the three Jedi using the Force to pull the idols to safety, and into the station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once aboard, the darkness they had been sensing before was overwhelming, and the group split up. Jareni commented on the spread of the darkness, and Vitus agreed with her. She further commented that the visions they had seen before had a strange familiarity to them now, but she dismissed it before the two of them headed into the dense brush. As they walked, Vitus brought up the clay warriors of Zardossa Stix, which Jareni had heard of and due to him bringing them up at this particular moment, she was immediately put on edge. Vitus speculated that the idols were keeping an army in place due to the nature of what they were feeling in the Force around them, though Jareni couldn't see an army."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the two were suddenly approached by plantlike beings, the Drengir, who expressed pleasure at having encountered meat. The pair were gradually surrounded by the creatures, and an oppressive sensation in the Force itself settled over them. The Drengir revealed the fact that they had been captured by the Sith which gave the Jedi pause before moving in to attack. Jareni jumped over the lead Drengir's head and cut into the creature with her lightsaber, only for the creature to laugh and strike back at her, the damage to its body rapidly healing. Jareni then cut off some of the lower tentacles of a different Drengir, causing it to collapse, and the two Jedi continued to duel against the increasingly large number of Drengir closing in on their position."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unfortunately, early into the fight, one of her calves had been grazed by a whip-like Drengir protrusion with poisonous thorns, causing said calf to ache from toe to hip, and leading to swelling stiffening her ankle and knee. Just then, her damaged foot ran into an 8-T unit, and she was sent sprawling. Initially, her fall irked her, but she soon realized she could use the gardening droids against the Drengir. She grabbed the one that had caused her to trip, but she found no way to alter its programming, so she was forced to use their existing directives. She then stood and jumped through the air, severing a bower connected to the atrium's ceiling which began to collapse. Landing on the ground with a stab of pain from her poisoned leg, she joined Vitus in deflecting the probes of the Drengir while backing up, bringing the Drengir to a point directly beneath the collapsing bower."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The architecture, drenched in vegetation, ultimately fell right on top of the Drengir, temporarily waylaying them. When they sought to cut themselves free, they damaged the vegetation which resulted in swarms of 8-Ts descending on them as they were perceived as harming the station's plant life. Jareni and Vitus watched on before centering themselves and forming a new Force container out of the idols sitting in the atrium. The act appeared like a green flash to Jareni, and its effect was instantaneous, the Drengir melting into the vegetation of the station. The two Jedi then rushed to find Hollow and Silas but were instead encountered by the Nihil member Hague."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The elderly Zabrak attempted to shoot his blaster at the pair, but Jareni used the Force to slow the bolt, the Jedi stepping to the side of it, before she released it, allowing it to crash into the nearby wall. Their confrontation continued, with Hague's earlier hidden rage freely flowing to the surface, and he trapped the pair of them with him in the airlock ring by shooting the door controls. After alerting the other Nihil on the station of the Jedi, a group soon closed in on their position as the Nihil vessel was directly moored to the airlock ring. Jareni considered their proximity to be a lesson from the Force in humility, as she had bragged to Hague about the two Jedi having their lightsabers with them. However, a grenade thrown by Affie Hollow disrupted the Nihil's charge, allowing Master Vitus and Wayseeker Jareni to charge forward themselves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jareni moved on Hague first, slicing his blaster into three parts before dodging his attempted attacks with the remains of his weapon. She then retreated, witnessing Vitus holding the remaining Nihil at bay in an archway, not allowing them through. She determined that they were in a combat stalemate, and moved to activate nearby emergency doors to give herself and Vitus more time by blocking off the Nihil's approach. She proceeded to the manual door controls on the ceiling, spinning her lightsaber to create a shield from Nihil blaster fire which reflected a fair number of the blasts right back to their source, and then used the Force to trigger the controls."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unfortunately, they realized too late that they had trapped Affie Hollow on the other side of the doors with the majority of the Nihil, and so moved in to assist her, drawing off a portion of her attackers in their approach. Jareni ended up dueling a pair of Nihil wielding energized polearms that could parry a lightsaber thrust, but she had the upper hand, slowly pushing them back. Next to her, Master Vitus performed a leg sweep with a metal beam controled through the Force, causing many Nihil to fall over. They then engaged in a strategic retreat, allowing for the two senior Jedi to regroup to find Hollow and Silas. While Leox Gyasi found Hollow, and Vitus found Reath Silas and a surprisingly alive Dez Rydan, Jareni continued to scout the damaged station for anything they could use strategically against the Nihil. Upon realizing that there was no other option, she decided to free the Drengir but moved to reunite with the rest of her group to inform them of the plan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the way, she ran into Padawan Silas and was filled in on the survival of Knight Rydan, in addition to the unique hyperspace pods aboard the station. She resolved to break the Force barrier with Silas, and the two rushed off to inform the others. On the way, they ran into Hollow and Gyasi and urged them to leave without them if they didn't return in ten minutes, though the two pilots refused to leave them behind. They were eventually convinced by the Jedi to return and prepare the Vessel for departure, with Jareni and Silas moving toward the arboretum to unleash the Drengir. Upon arrival, they realized that the new barrier was too difficult to bring down with just two Jedi. Jareni then picked up a blaster, apologized to Silas for desecrating history, and shot the idol of the humanoid queen between the eyes, causing a wave of energy to knock both her and the Padawan off their feet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dazed, the pair managed to stand and started to retreat, the Drengir hot on their tail. When they reached the entryway to the equatorial ring, they found the Nihil marshaling to attack them, a gas grenade being fired in their direction upon their arrival. The pair ducked the grenade, which flew into the ranks of the Drengir, seeming to awaken a desire for combat in the plant creatures. They rushed past the Jedi to engage the Nihil, allowing Wayseeker Jareni and Padawan Silas to flee back to their ship. On the way, they ran into Master Vitus, who informed them of the plants which had grown around the Vessel and was keeping it attached to the station. Jareni and Vitus were distracted by this new development and didn't notice until they reached the airlock that Silas had left."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He then vented the arboretum into space, while also launching all of the hyperspace-capable pods. The station was not significantly damaged, but the death of Drengir and most of the Nihil allowed the group to take their time cutting away the vines that had tried to trap the Vessel before departing. At this time, Jareni felt the need to answer the call of wild, open space, and was looking forward to leaving.
