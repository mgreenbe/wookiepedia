Whilst he attempted to retrieve the sculpture he was interrupted by the bounty hunters Boba Fett and the Strom brothers. Despite the hunters presence, Somaz retrieved the sculpture which triggered a large number of Arachedron to attack all four men present. Fett took the sculpture, which the insects were attracted to, and hurled it away into the depths of the ship and used the distraction to escape.

In the year 2 ABY, Somaz spent weeks searching for the sculpture aboard the luxury cruiser Reverie which lay wrecked in a Starship Graveyard at the edge of the galaxy. He was eventually successful in finding the sculpture, which made up the head of a multi-armed statue located deep within the ship. To retrieve the Arachedron sculpture, Somaz killed one of the many spider-like Arachedron creatures that lived on the ship and seemed to be attracted to the sculpture. Wearing the creatures corpse to disguise himself the treasure hunter made his way to the statue and scaled it, but as he reached the top the Mandalorian bounty hunter Boba Fett and the two bounty hunting Strom brothers, Edo and Rolu approached the statue."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The three hunters explained that they were there to claim the valuable artifact for themselves, and demanded Somaz hand it over. The Dresssellian cursed his luck and removed the sculpture, causing a huge number of Arachedron to become frenzied and attack all four hunters. As the group fought of the insects Somaz explained that it was the artifact that the creatures wanted, not them. Coming to the decision that the value of the artifact wasn't worth his life, Fett took the sculpture from Somaz and hurled it into the depths of the ship, causing the Arachedron to follow. Horrified at Fett's decision Rolu leapt at the Mandalorian and cursed him before leaping after it into the abyss. Edo reached to try and save his brother but failed, prompting Somaz to try and pull back Edo and persuade him it was time to leave. Edo refused to leave though and followed his brother into the depths of the collapsing ship, returning Fett's jetpack first. As the ship came down around them Somaz begged Fett to help him get out alive and offered to pay him 50,000 if he saved him. Fett asked for 100,000, to which Somaz agreed and so the Mandalorian used his jetpack to carry Somaz to safety. As the pair left the graveyard in Fett's ship, Slave I, the treasure hunter transferred Fett the promised money. after which Fett revealed he had recognized Somaz and new there was a bounty on him, which the bounty hunter planned to claim."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Somaz devoted most of his adult life to hunting the Arachedron sculpture, being dedicated enough to spend weeks alone searching for it in a dangerous and abandoned cruiser. He managed to work out a way to get pass the Arachedron guarding his target and was willing to wear a corpse on his back to do so. After retrieving the sculpture he was willing to sacrifice it, and almost every credit he owned to save his own life. Once safe he admitted that the Strom's brothers suicidal pursuit of the sculpture had scared him but reflected that he might of done the same. Somaz had brown skin and eyes and was without hair. Whilst on the Reverie he wore a brown cloak along with a brown shirt and pants. He also made use of a pair of red goggles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Somaz first appeared in Star Wars Adventures: Boba Fett and the Ship of Fear, a graphic novella written by Jeremy Barlow, pencilled by Daxiong and released in 2011 as part of the Star Wars Adventures series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
