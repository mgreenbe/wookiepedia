Small and spartan like all personal chambers in the Jedi Temple, they afforded more peace then the Temple dormitories reserved for the younglings and younger Knights."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The room contained a small bed, along with a desk where Jaina could study or perform her research projects. It was here that Jaina first was re-introduced to her new Jedi supervisor, Dab Hantaq. Taken aback by his similarities to her dead brother Anakin Solo, she was increasingly uncomfortable when she ordered him to sit, though she was sitting in the room's only seat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
