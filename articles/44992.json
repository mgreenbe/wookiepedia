At the age of thirteen, Tarn was taken as a Padawan by the Gran Jedi Master Maks Leem and served in the Jedi Order for a period as a protector for the Republic. A headstrong yet principled student, Tarn defied the authority of many people, including his Master. When the Clone Wars erupted in 22 BBY, Tarn was one of many Jedi to become disillusioned with the Jedi Order. He left the Order and became a follower of Sian Jeisel, a Jedi Master who believed that the Jedi should have been fighting against the seemingly corrupt Republic rather then defending it against the Confederacy of Independent Systems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character of Eremin Tarn was mentioned in Yoda: Dark Rendezvous, a novel written by Sean Stewart and published in 2004."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
