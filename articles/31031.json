Separate from the Jedi Order, the Shadows were based on the same concept as Jedi Shadows, though these agents were tasked with hunting down Sith artifacts. Among some of the captured treasures were the last Epistle of Marka Ragnos, Jori Daragon's amulet and the Eye of Horak-mul. Around 3963 BBY, agent Celeste Morne was given the task of finding the Muur Talisman on Taris.
