Instead, it reinterprets the stories and battles presented in the original trilogy, alongside some battles presented in the novel Battlefront: Twilight Company such as the Siege of Inyusu Tor. The game has the option to switch at will between first-person mode and third-person mode, much like the previous entries in the series. Instead of a single-player campaign, the game features a set of co-op missions that can be played alone, online, or offline with split-screen. Players are able to play as hero and villain characters such as Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. Each player is outfitted with a partner, and the duo are able to spawn on each other and share loadouts. DICE based the game's AI on the Star Wars films, but tweaked it to make it accessible. Classes are not featured in the game, for the player is able to freely customize their weapons, character, Star Cards and hands, and traits. When the game first installs on the system, players have the opportunity to play a mini-game as it is loading. They take the role of Darth Vader and face waves of Rebel troopers inside Echo Base (similar to the singleplayer Hero Battles)."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Game modes"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Multiplayer"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike DICE's previous games, Battlefront does not use the Battlelog system to connect players.

In order to prevent this, Imperial forces must keep these uplinks offline. The Imperials are the only faction allowed to use ground vehicles in this mode. Players on the Imperial side are allowed to use AT-ATs and AT-STs; AT-STs are a smaller, two-legged version of the AT-AT that have less health than the AT-AT. In this game mode, the AT-ATs are referred to as Imperial Walkers, while the AT-STs are referred to as Scout Transports. Players can use the scout transports until they are destroyed, while AT-AT pilots only have a certain amount of time. This time can be extended by getting kills in the walker.

The mission called Invasion is relatively similar, although players this time pilot Snowspeeders on Hoth. In Overpower, the player acts as an Imperial soldier piloting an AT-ST. In the Endor Chase mission, the player must chase Rebel troopers who have hijacked speeder bikes.
