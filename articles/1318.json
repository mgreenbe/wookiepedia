Similar to the other Duwani-made utility droid models of the time, the 3C droid had four wheeled legs, of which the front two were attached to the droid's blocky chassis by rotating joints, allowing the droid to slide backward and forward to adjust the unit's height. Including the droid's flat rotating head, the unit stood 0.96 meters high. The droid's equipment included a multi-functional arm, auditory and sonar scanners, radar eye, and visual sensors capable of handling all base colors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Manufactured sometime before 3951 BBY, one of these utility droids, 3C-FD, was on board the light freighter Ebon Hawk when the ship escaped from the Sith-infiltrated Republic cruiser Harbinger in that year. After their close escape, which resulted in the Ebon Hawk being badly damaged and drifting in space close to the Peragus Mining Facility, 3C-FD helped another Duwani-made utility droid, T3-M4, fix the ship. After their repairs, they piloted the Ebon Hawk to the mining facility, but before they docked the ship, 3C-FD was shot repeatedly and damaged beyond repair by an HK-50 series assassin droid unit that had been hiding in the damaged vessel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The only 3C-series utility droid in Star Wars Legends, 3C-FD, appeared in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, a 2004 video game developed by Obsidian Entertainment.
