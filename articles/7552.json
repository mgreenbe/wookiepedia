When they came in contact with a target, it instantly disintegrated. Apparently, anti-matter pods were also used to contain antimatter used as fuel in certain hyperdrives. Once fired they can't be stopped, similar to a turbolaser, however antimatter could be fired in pure energy form with equal firepower. Anti-matter pods were not used anywhere in the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
