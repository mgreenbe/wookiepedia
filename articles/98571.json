The planet known as Novor 33 was its outer-most planet. At some point, the sun expanded to become a red giant and destroyed the seventeen worlds that orbited closest to it, leaving it with sixteen. Novor 33, nor any of the other remaining worlds, was not affected drastically by their sun's activity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Early exploits brought the ancient galactic explorers to areas near where the planet was between the years 27,500 BBY and 25,000 BBY.

Hutt Space\u2014the Hutt Empire reorganized itself sometime around 25,000 BBY\u2014maintained its political boundaries of the time for at least 2,900 years. Additionally, after the invention of the hyperdrive, another generation of explorers reevaluated the frontier around the planet between 20,000 BBY and 15,000 BBY. The area was considered explored extensively by the Galactic Republic by 5000 BBY, at which point it was still considered within Hutt Space. This would remain the case through the Great Sith War that raged from 1004 BBY to 1000 BBY. During that conflict, the Hutts and the Krath observed a non-aggression agreement. As such, another partner of the Krath called the Sith Empire had great political authority over all Hutt Space at the time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet resided amid Hutt Space throughout the millennium after the Great Sith War, through 19 BBY, until the Galactic Empire rose to power. Hutt Space shrunk greatly after this, stabilizing for the long-term; the area around the Novor system and its planets fell out of Hutt influence. The Galactic Empire lead by the Sith Lord Darth Krayt claimed far-reaching political influence that encompassed the area where the planet resided in 137 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
