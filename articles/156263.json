They had two anterior flipper-like appendages, along with a long and flexible tail. They possessed a wide open mouth at the base of their eyestalk, with several sharp teeth surrounding it. On each side of their mouths grew a small appendage. Their skin was a reddish-brown color, and they had black stripes on their back. They had enhanced adrenal glands that allowed for short bursts of amazing strength."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This species controlled their environment through terraforming facilities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One member of this species was the mercenary, Niado Duegad, from the planet Vodran.
