In that year, the Zoolli Arabelle Lorteli was personally selected by Galactic Alliance Chief of State Natasi Daala to serve as a judge on the Court of Jedi Affairs. In that role, she presided over the arraignment of former-Jedi Knight and bounty hunter Tahiri Veila before the court, and denied Veila legal representation by Twi'lek counselor Nawara Ven on the grounds of a conflict of interest with the Jedi Order. Judge Lorteli later signed a writ for members of the Jedi Order providing them permission to visit Valin Horn and Jysella Horn who were being held in an Alliance prison. When made aware of this writ, Daala insinuated that the Jedi used a mind trick on the Zoolli to obtain the writ.
