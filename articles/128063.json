By 32 BBY Leeda lived on the Outland Transit Station in the Baxel sector, where he stole fuel cells from the stations Toydarian administrator Rozatta. The loss of the fuel cells cost the Toydarian greatly and she placed a bounty of 3,000 credits for his capture alive, offering only half that if he was brought in dead. The Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett encountered Leeda in Outland Station's docking facilities whilst the hunter was on the station chasing the Muttani criminal Meeko Ghintee. Leeda attacked Fett, but the hunter had been informed of the price on the Aqualish's head by Rozatta herself and he captured the criminal alive, claiming the bounty."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sobo Leeda first appeared in the video game Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, which was released by LucasArts in 2002.
