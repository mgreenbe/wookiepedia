The forward pod split into an inverted-V shape which allowed for greater surface area to mount weaponry; furthermore the connecting spar was heavier, rendering it less vulnerable to being split open by heavy fire, and the ship was about 50 meters shorter overall."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sublight speed was 17% faster, and shield strength and hull durability were both improved.
