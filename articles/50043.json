In the grav-ball season held approximately six years before the Battle of Yavin, they were generally a poor-performing team. When they faced the AppSci SaberCats in the final match of the season before the match for the league title, their record was 1-8. Their center striker performed erratically and their kicker lacked range. Furthermore, they were undisciplined, as their coach regularly had to shout at them and during pre-game drills, half of the team wandered or chatted with spectators. The SaberCats easily won the match by a margin of thirty-two points."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
