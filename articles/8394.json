It provided moderate protection against attacks and was designed to be fitted with sensor modules. One drawback was the form-fitting nature of the armor required any power cells to be mounted to the outside of the armor, making them vulnerable to enemy fire. The famed bounty hunter Beylyssa wore a modified set of this armor equipped with a sensor pod, infrared sensors, a turbo-projected grappling hook, a winch, and an environment filter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
