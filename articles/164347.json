Along with her aide, Lieutenant Palob Godalhi, she once met with Bria Tharen of the Corellian resistance to discuss working with the Corellians in open rebellion against the Galactic Empire. She felt that Teth's location in the Outer Rim meant that they would not be of great assistance to any organized resistance, but did agree to increase raids on Imperial vessels and munitions dumps and to help supply the Corellians with the stolen weapons. She was captured by bounty hunters Dace Bonearm and IG-72."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
