As a result, the New Republic managed to transfer intelligence to the Resistance, and as such discovered that the First Order was operating in secret on the Outer Rim planet of Castilon. The Resistance dispatched a spy, the newly recruited Kazuda Xiono, to investigate.

Utilizing his own personal TIE/ba Baron Space Superiority Interceptor, Vonreg engaged a squadron of New Republic T-85 X-wing starfighters at one point in the waning months of the Cold War. The New Republic pilots had acquired critical information pertaining to the First Order's operations in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories, and had been instructed by New Republic Command to deliver the intelligence to the Resistance.

However, he was ultimately outmaneuvered by the teamwork of Dameron and Xiono, resulting in damage to his starfighter. As a result, the major retreated into hyperspace, eventually returning to Starkiller Base in the Unknown Regions. In failing to prevent Xiono from completing his mission, the Resistance learned of the First Order's interest in the Colossus, an aircraft refueling station located on the ocean planet Castilon.

Vonreg insisted to Doza that the Colossus was vulnerable to pirate attack, and made several veiled threats to him. Doza did not take the First Order's offer, noting that they would have to do better than one shipment of fuel to buy him. Shortly after leaving Doza's office, Vonreg became aware that someone had been spying on the meeting using a pair of matched comlinks, as when the two comlinks were brought too close together and both active they produced feedback. Vonreg hear this and spotted the spy, Kazuda Xiono, but unknown to Vonreg this was the same pilot who he had fought against in space. Vonreg ordered his stormtroopers to capture Xiono, who fled. After Xiono managed to evade the troopers, Vonreg confronted Doza, who was incredulous about the thought of there being a spy on his platform. After Doza's daughter Torra claimed the intruder had merely been a friend of hers, who had gotten lost on his way out of Doza Tower, Doza ordered Vonreg to leave with his troopers."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "All Aces Battle Royale"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime later, Marnia Un'la'na, an informant of the First Order, was on the Colossus prior to the All Aces Battle Royale.
