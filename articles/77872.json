Prior to the Despot War, the Nine Houses, feudal gangster clans led by an aristocracy, answered to the Kral. Hadiya attempted to unite the Nine Houses and conquer the Tython system when she became Kral, which caused the Houses to revolt and ally with the Je'daii of Tython. This sparked the Despot War, which ended in 25,805 BBY with the death of Hadiya."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
