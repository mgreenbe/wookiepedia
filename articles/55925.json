Both her father and her grandfather practiced that activity in their own times, and she followed in their footsteps. She traveled to a hundred planet and moons, hunting beasts and collecting their heads as trophies. However, she came to despise the heavily guarded tourist reserves in which she could only shoot what she was allowed to. Therefore, she decided to find a planet of her own."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mistress of Xirl"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gozetta built herself a motley crew comprising the humanoid male Meggin, the Umbaran female Sata, and the Cerean male Delih. She also hired two mercenaries, the Pau'an male Corin and the human male Bort. At some point during the age of the Galactic Empire, Gozetta and her crew explored Wild Space and discovered Xirl, a planet apparently devoid of native lifeforms bigger than a tree snake. Gozetta intended to populate Xirl with shipped-in dangerous creatures of her choosing, which would breed and thrive on the planet and provide the hunter with a constant supply of challenging preys. Meggin was specifically tasked with keeping the creatures alive long enough for the huntress to kill them. Gozetta established a luxuous hunting lodge on Xirl, in which she kept her trophies. The crew had at least two starships: the freighter Venture, and Gozetta's private golden shuttle. What the huntress did not know, however, was that the seemingly innocuous stinkers native to Xirl could grow to gargantuan sizes provided that they lived long enough. One such giant lived in a cave that had once been inhabited by humanoids."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Meeting the Grafs"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, things started to turn awry when Delih, Meggin, and Sata disappeared. Gozetta, Bort, and Corin set off to locate their missing crew members, but to no avail. During the search, however, Gozetta noticed that soem kind of creature had torn two large holes in hull of the Venture\u2014 which she assumed was the work of her gundarks. The huntress also discovered the presence of two human younglings, Lina and Milo Graf, and their mismatched droid caretaker, Crater. In addition to having discovered intruders on the planet she had claimed for herself, Gozetta also found out that a throng of stinkers had caused damage to her lodge. the huntress, forced the children to accompany her and her mercenaries through the jungle, in search of whatever had struck the Venture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After following the trail, Gozetta and her reluctant hunting party arrived at the cave where the monstrous stinker resided. The huntress forced the Grafs to enter the cave and act as baits and lure the beast out. The children were forced to obey lest Gozetta refused to help them leave Xirl. The huntress then kept waiting for a while, standing in front of the cave's mouth while her mercenaries had taken cover. Eventually, Meggin burst out of the lair, followed by Sata, the Grafs, and, still in the shadows of the cavern, the giant stinker. Both her crew and the children attempted to reason her, but Gozetta would have none of it: she would stand her ground and kill the beast. However, after the stinker incapacitated Corin with a paralyzing agent and dragged him into the cave, the huntress finally realized she could not defeat that creature. She turned on her heels and started running in the opposite direction, dashing toward her golden shuttle which she had kept on standby back at the lodge, with no concern for the rest of the party."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Last stand in the jungle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Gozetta managed to board the shuttle and take it off the ground, the beast sprang for her and locked its pincers around the craft. After fighting for control, Gozetta managed to free herself from the beast's deadly embrace for a moment, but her triumph did not last, as the stinker managed to wrap the ship in its tongue and drag it into its mouth. The creature's then jaws closed on the shuttle, which broke and tumbled down into the trees. Against all odds, the huntress survived the crash with only minor wounds. Emerging from the shuttle's wreckage, she made one last stand against the monster, firing a rocket at it. However, the projectile missed its target, which forced Gozetta to back into the trees. The stinker then followed her in the thick forest, and the last that was heard or seen of both Gozetta and the stinker was a loud crash."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A pale-skinned woman with red hair and ice-blue eyes, Gozetta had a pitiless look upon her face and a cold smile.
