One, the \"starburst insignia,\" depicted a starburst behind the old phoenix crest of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. One possible color scheme for that sigil was blue crest over yellow starburst. The carbon-lace armors worn by the members of the New Republic Special Forces were marked with the starburst insignia on the shoulders. Around 34 ABY, that sigil also appeared on the wings of the T-85 X-wings of the New Republic Defense Fleet, and on the uniforms and helmets worn by the New Republic pilots."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another sigil was the \"rounded insignia.\" A more understated emblem, it was also based on the Alliance starbird, set within a circle of fifteen stars that  represented unity. It was found among security forces. Around 9 ABY, a yellow version of the rounded insignia notably appeared on distinct types of security droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The \"starburst insignia\" of the New Republic was created by Christopher M.
