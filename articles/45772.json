He became a Master and was given a long-term seat on the Jedi Council, serving on the Council during the Stark Hyperspace War, the Yinchorri Uprising, and the Eriadu Trade Summit.

Like most of his generation, he was expected to live a life of deprivation and misery on a planet where continuous conflict was commonplace. However, Piell was discovered to be strong in the Force as an infant and was taken away from his homeworld by a Jedi to undergo training at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Piell showed an aptitude for the light side of the Force and proved an able wielder of the lightsaber. The Lannik Jedi constructed his own lightsaber and often used it in his duties as a Jedi Guardian. He earned a reputation as a fierce and humorless warrior who would never back away from a fight, eventually becoming a revered Jedi Knight. After becoming a Master sometime prior to the Stark Hyperspace War, he was granted a long-term seat on the Jedi High Council alongside the likes of Masters Yoda and Mace Windu. He was also a scholar on the Council of First Knowledge.

He served with the Lannik royal Palace Guard, alongside fellow Lannik Hutar Zash, protecting two generations of Lannik princes; though a Jedi and fiercely loyal to the Republic, he never forgot his roots and served loyally and diligently. The Lannik government were embroiled in a costly war with a group of terrorists known as the Red Iaro, who were opposed to the traditional ways of Lannik and wanted to rule the planet in their own, extremist way. Negotiations between the two groups\u2014mediated by high-profile Corellian diplomats\u2014proved fruitless, and in a desperate, suicidal attempt to gain a foothold in the war, seven members of the Red Iaro, led by General Myk'chur Finux Zug, stormed a meeting between the diplomats and Lannik's prince in the Lannik High Court, holding them hostage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Piell fought off the revolutionaries, slaying six of them and saving the lives of the Lannik royalty and the Corellian diplomats.

However, he refused to accept bacta therapy or a prosthetic replacement for his lost eye; to him, the scar represented honor, bravery, and reminded him of his prevailing against the immoral despite incredible odds. He carried it as a badge of pride, and he never forgot his efforts in keeping the peace on his homeworld. Yet the Red Iaro continued their insurgent activities under Zug's command; a bounty, later accepted by the bounty hunter Aldar Beedo, was put on Piell and his fellow Council members' heads by the \"Chosen One,\" the leader of a cult which hoped to increase terrorist activity on Lannik."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Corellian diplomats' daughter, Adi Gallia, was herself a Jedi, and she forever felt indebted to Piell for his actions in saving her parents.

Piell served on the Council during many conflicts, such as the Stark Hyperspace War, as one of the Council's senior and strongest members. He was more outspoken that the majority of his peers, and he was characterized by his somewhat radical\u2014and always direct\u2014ideas and decisions. During the Yinchorri Uprising in 33 BBY, when many Council members were investigating in the Yinchorri system, the Temple was infiltrated by a group of Yinchorri warriors in a bold attempt to assassinate the Jedi. Wielding his lightsaber, Piell, as well as numerous other Jedi, was able to repel the Yinchorri with minimal casualties, though the Council was deeply worried\u2014it was evident that some unknown entity had guided the Yinchorri into such a foolhardy assault. The mission to the Yinchorr system undertaken by Mace Windu and a team of other Jedi was successful, although not without its casualties; Piell attended the triple funeral of fellow Council member Micah Giiett, as well as the Jedi Lilit Twoseas and Theen Fida."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Piell was on the Council during the Eriadu Trade Summit in the same year. A team of Jedi led by Master Qui-Gon Jinn had been ambushed during a mission to Asmeru concurrent with the Summit and had lost contact with Coruscant; the Nebula Front terrorist organization claimed to have captured a number of hostages on Asmeru and demanded that the Trade Summit be canceled. Piell advocated stopping the Nebula Front with force, but many of his fellow Council members wished for a more subtle approach. The Lannik also advised offering the houses of the Senex sector\u2014a self-governing domain that existed apart from the Republic and controlled Asmeru\u2014a deal in exchange for their co-operation; Piell believed that allowing them free trade with the Republic\u2014something which they had been refused because of their slave breeding\u2014for their assistance in bringing the Nebula Front to justice was the best course of action to take. Ultimately, Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum was able to end the crisis, though not without losing a considerable amount of support in the Senate.

He told the Council of his encounter, though many of its members were skeptical; nevertheless, Mace Windu agreed to investigate and learn the identity of Jinn's attacker. Jinn had another matter to discuss with the Council: he had found a young boy, named Anakin Skywalker, who was extremely strong in the Force and whom Jinn believed might be the Chosen One. Skywalker was brought before the Council, though they deemed him too old and potentially dangerous to be trained. Windu sent Jinn and his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, to Naboo in an attempt to lure out the supposed Sith; the plan worked, and Kenobi was able so slay the Dark Lord, but Jinn perished. Piell and the other members of the Council traveled to Naboo to attend Jinn's funeral. It was the beginning of a dark time for the Jedi High Council; one Sith had been slain, but they were unsure if it was the Master or the apprentice.

The Gran Protectorate offered to hold the negotiations on a neutral ground, the planet Malastare, and the Republic's Judicial Department requested that the Jedi Council send delegates to act as arbiters during the meetings. Adi Gallia, still feeling that she had a debt to repay to Piell, brought the matter up at a meeting of the Council, championing Piell's sacrifice, though he brushed off her comments. As it was a matter of great importance to many systems nearby Lannik, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine requested that only members of the Council travel to Malastare. Piell volunteered, as his people's ways\u2014considered somewhat primitive and strange by galactic society\u2014were unknown to the other Jedi, and he felt his presence on Malastare was necessary.

En route, Piell, Gallia, and Yaddle realized the group was being followed and monitored by a Lannik, whom they presumed was a member of the Red Iaro, and a hooded Ffib priest, a member of a theocratic religion established on the planet Lorahns; intrigued, Piell and Gallia doubled back and intercepted the duo, asking why they were following the Jedi Council members. The Lannik and the priest responded by shooting at Piell and Gallia, though the Jedi Masters were able to fend them off with ease, with the help of Ki-Adi-Mundi and his Padawan, A'Sharad Hett, who had just arrived in the corridor.

They were introduced to Wphshun and Senator Aks Moe, the Grans who would chair the meeting; Lannik Prince R'cardo Sooflie IX, the son of the prince whose life Piell had saved several years previously; and Sooflie's military advisor, Piell's old colleague Hutar Zash. Sooflie was suspicious of a countryman serving with what he considered \"religious ragamuffins,\" and Piell introduced himself; when Sooflie showed no sign of remembering either Piell or his sacrifice, Gallia admonished him, though the Lannik Prince remarked that had Piell not saved his parents' lives, he might have become prince sooner."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Red Iaro representatives, led by Myk'chur Finux Zug, eventually arrived, several minutes late, and were immediately dismissive of the Jedi, believing their presence to be unnecessary. Piell confronted Zug, but the Lannik revolutionary claimed that times had changed; the Red Iaro, he said, was tired of fighting and wished to stop. Piell, however, knew that Zug would be back to his old ways before long. Negotiations started, though it was clear to the Jedi that they would go nowhere; Zug's demands were not unreasonable, but Sooflie refused to accept anything, and after an angry outburst from the Prince, Windu called a recess in the talks. Hutar Zash and several other Lannik guardsmen offered to give the Jedi a lift to their quarters in the Governor's palace, and, hoping to use the opportunity to speak to Zash, Piell accepted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "En route, Zash told Piell of matters on Lannik; since Sooflie had ascended to power, the old ways and traditions were dying, and the people were growing more and more unhappy with their new prince.

Presuming that Zug and Zash were in league with each other, the Jedi believed that Zug, with his plan to kill the Jedi a failure, would be desperate, and they concluded that he would attempt to assassinate Sooflie. They arrived in the Prince's chamber as Zug and his minions were preparing to feed Sooflie to a pair of akk dogs, non-sentient predators native to Haruun Kal. Not wanting to kill the creatures, the Jedi subdued them, but Zug was able to use the opportunity to try and escape with a jetpack through the ceiling window\u2014however, he collided with a podracer, and was killed. Aks Moe and his guards arrived within moments, removing the remaining revolutionaries before the Jedi could question them; the Senator announced the peace talks' end and requested the Jedi return to Coruscant.

Piell served on the Jedi Council throughout the Separatist Crisis and watched with continuing dismay as more and more systems seceded and joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems, led by Count Dooku\u2014a former Jedi. However, the CIS was by far not the only threat that the Order, and the Republic, faced. In 30 BBY, a rogue Dark Jedi\u2014former Jedi Padawan Aurra Sing\u2014killed two Jedi Masters, J'Mikel and Peerce, on Coruscant, in the shadow of the Temple itself. Piell in particular was shocked by this when it was announced during a Council meeting, and although many efforts were made to apprehend Sing, none succeeded. Following Sing's attack on the Jedi, Piell and the Council attended the ceremony to make Jedi Knight Quinlan Vos a Jedi Master and Padawan Aayla Secura a Knight, though the Council lost Masters Yaddle and Yarael Poof, who both perished defending the Republic from terrorists; they were replaced by the Jedi Shaak Ti and Coleman Trebor, respectively.

Early in the war, Piell was present during an important Jedi Council meeting, in which the Masters discussed the war. The Separatists' new Supreme Commander, General Grievous, had recently killed several Jedi during the Battle of Hypori, and the Council was worried about the dwindling numbers of fully-fledged Jedi in the Order. Newly promoted Council member Obi-Wan Kenobi suggested that they make his Padawan, Anakin Skywalker, a Knight, though many on the Council disagreed, believing Skywalker too headstrong.

While Tarkin and several clone naval officers were installed in a holding cell, Piell was incarcerated in another cell, where he was held in a containment field. Under supervision from an A4 laboratory assistant droid, a BX-series droid commando electrocuted Piell multiple times with an electrostaff in an attempt to force the Nexus Route intelligence out of him. Piell failed to crack, however, even when the A4-series droid coerced him into yielding the information to put an end to the torture. Just as the droid made to cut out Piell's remaining eye, an elite team of Jedi and clone troopers\u2014having infiltrated the Citadel under the command of Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi\u2014broke into Piell's cell.

Sobeck activated an ultrasonic wave that impaired the group's hearing, while a powerful magnet drew the Jedi's lightsabers and the clones' blasters to a raised crevasse in the ceiling. Skywalker was even sucked up to the ceiling by his cybernetic arm, which fell to the magnet's attraction. As the sound frequency died down, droid commandos arrived from both directions of the hallway to subdue the unarmed Jedi and troopers. In response, Piell and Tano attempted to Force-push the droids away, while Kenobi pitted his telekinesis against the others. When the droids magnetized their feet to the floor, the three Jedi redoubled their efforts, giving Skywalker enough time to deactivate the magnet holding their lightsabers.

The group split up, and Piell and Kenobi led their men through the Citadel, planting thermal detonators as they went. When Kenobi activated the charges, they caused an intense explosion to take the Citadel, compromising one of its entire levels. Thanks to the distraction, Skywalker and his comrades were able to escape from the Citadel. Meanwhile, Kenobi, Piell, and their team headed for the Citadel's upper levels through a ventilation shaft. Kenobi contacted the Republic's stolen Separatist shuttle, piloted by Skywalker's astromech droid, R2-D2, and several reprogrammed battle droids.

Kenobi tried to raise Skywalker via comlink, but instead they heard Sobeck, who revealed that he had predicted their every move. Upon his words, several hidden turrets on the platform came online, while droid commandos, droidekas, and an LM-432 crab droid emerged, capturing Piell and the others. They were subsequently taken to Sobeck's command center, where the warden demanded that Piell disclose his half of information, threatening to start executing his men if he refused. Piell did not comply, stating that all of them, including the clones, were ready to die to protect the intelligence. Challenging Piell's claims, Sobeck killed one of them with a shot in the head.

The lie initially worked and allowed Piell and the others passage toward the shuttle, but they were soon stopped when K2-B4 informed the droid guards about the group's escape\u2014with assistance from reprogrammed droids. Kenobi destroyed the nearest guard with his lightsaber, but heavy laser cannons opened fire at the Republic team, forcing them to take cover, while more battle droids arrived at the landing platform.

Although he had a passion for wisdom and was glad to be a scholar on the Council of First Knowledge, he did not let such a position stand in the way of making snap decisions, be it on the Jedi Council or on the battlefield. He believed in diplomacy and negotiations, but he also did not shy away from using force to settle confrontations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Piell was extremely loyal to the Jedi, the Republic, and his homeworld. While most Jedi never returned to their planet of origin after being trained in the ways of the Force, Piell was an exception, and to him it was an honor to serve the Lannik royal family, something he took very seriously. He cared deeply for the fate of his homeworld, and it saddened him that some, such as the Gran, seemed to be determined to exploit its untapped natural resources. Piell was known for his considerable wisdom, which he acquired during his long life as a Jedi. However, too many, particularly those on his homeworld who did not understand the ways of the Jedi, he was simply an old man who was too attached to ancient traditions. He was a traditionalist, teaching his pupils with tested, proven methods; he disapproved of the unorthodox teaching methods favored by many of his peers, such as Master An'ya Kuro, claiming that they were brutal and disturbing. Piell was opposed to oppression or slavery of any kind, and he voiced his displeasure to the Grans of Malastare that they had subjugated the native Dugs of the world and made them subservient. Despite this, Piell was a proponent of ignoring the Senex sector's stance on slave breeding at the time Eriadu Trade Summit, and allowing them to join the Republic in exchange for their co-operation in apprehending the bounty hunter Arwen Cohl."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Piell was quick-thinking, and when his Star Destroyer was boarded by the Separatists, he cleverly committed half of the information on the Nexus Route to memory while having his Captain, Wilhuff Tarkin, memorize the other half. Piell sometimes disagreed with Tarkin, who harbored certain doubts about the Jedi and their abilities, and their relationship was slightly tense at times. When Tarkin inquired as to what they would do if they did not find the Republic forces at the rendezvous point, Piell brusquely told him to just keep moving, leading Skywalker to advise Tarkin not to try to argue with the diminutive Jedi Master. Unlike Tarkin, who meant for his half of the information to reach Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's ears, Piell intended for his part of the intelligence to be disclosed only to the Jedi High Council. While being interrogated in the Citadel, Piell refused to surrender his information on the Nexus Route to a mere interrogator droid. When faced with Osi Sobeck himself, who threatened to start killing his men if he refused to divulge the information, Piell believed that all of them, including the threatened clones, were prepared to die to protect the information for the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although his seriousness made him well-suited to important Council business, Piell had a dry sense of humor, developed from his long years spent on the battlefield; he joked with Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi even when faced with the daunting prospect of escaping from the Citadel. He also displayed a certain amount of self-confidence, believing that it would not be a problem for the Republic team to hold out on Lola Sayu until Plo Koon's arrival and that they would easily defeat Sobeck's battle droids. Even when dying, he was determined to complete the mission at all costs and found within himself the strength to tell Ahsoka Tano the vital information before he died. Despite the fact that Tano had not even been authorized to join the mission, Piell felt that she had become the most important part of the operation, as she was now the person who would ensure, in his place, that the Nexus Route intelligence reached the Jedi Council. Tano viewed Piell's sacrifice as honorable, and the news of his actions struck the Jedi on Coruscant as well, with Mace Windu stating that he would be missed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A great warrior who was no stranger to battle, Even Piell practiced all seven lightsaber forms with equal proficiency, although he did not have a preference for any one of them. He was a highly talented swordsman with his crimson\u2014later green\u2014lightsaber, capable of deflecting blaster bolts with ease, which he demonstrated during the mission to Malastare and his escape from the Citadel. He even came to be considered one of the Jedi Council's strongest members. Among his natural abilities included his increased audio capacity, as his large ears were sensitive in thin atmospheres. He stood up to severe amounts of torture and electrocution, even remaining conscious throughout such bouts. Like all Jedi, however, he was not infallible, and droidekas were able to take him prisoner aboard his cruiser. Piell was a Jedi Guardian, meaning that he focused more lightsaber combat and also on using the Force in combat than for other means. He was also a skilled manipulator of the Force; he was able to use it to telekinetically push battle droids away aboard his cruiser and to propel himself in the air while facing off against numerous battle droids on Lola Sayu. His mastery of the Force on Lola Sayu was well complemented by his agility in combat; he was quite nimble given his size, and he used his nimbleness in conjunction with his use of a lightsaber.

Pavan found this particular lesson difficult to comprehend, even years later. Piell, who became almost like a father to his Padawan, took Pavan on many assignments, including two into the deepest level of Coruscant's undercity. Pavan was knighted two months before the war's end in 19 BBY; by this point, Piell, now quite old, was no longer a member of the Jedi High Council, and his vacant seat was taken by Anakin Skywalker. Piell was present in the Jedi Temple when Order 66 and Operation: Knightfall were initiated. Hordes of clone troopers, led by Anakin Skywalker\u2014who had become the Sith Lord Darth Vader, freshly turned to the dark side\u2014assaulted the Temple, mercilessly killing Jedi, employees, and younglings, while across the galaxy, clone troopers turned on their generals and executed them. Piell fled the Temple, finding his way into Coruscant's underlevels and hiding there. He believed that he was the only senior Council member to survive the slaughter, though several other Councilors did in fact survive. In the days that followed, Palpatine issued the Declaration of a New Order, becoming Galactic Emperor, and the remaining Jedi were hunted down one by one by Darth Vader and many other dark side underlings.

Some time after Operation: Knightfall, Piell learned of a droid, designated 4-TO, that held considerable amounts of secret information of a sensitive nature about the Empire.

Piell tried to escape via a tube, through which an elevator once traveled, though he had to use the Force in order to push himself upwards. The stormtroopers entered the building just as he entered the tube, and began firing at it; too late, Piell realized their tactics. They fired above and below where he was, melting the tube and fusing the two sides together to create an impassable mass, leaving Piell trapped. Using his lightsaber, he was able to free himself from the tube, though he was still effectively trapped; the five troopers had blocked the only exit, and Piell knew that his weeks on the run, with little food or rest, had left him far from peak fighting condition."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Piell deflected everything the Imperials fired at him, but he was unable to escape.

Piell was still able to use the Force to deflect blaster bolts and make his way toward the door, but again, the clones were one step ahead of him.
