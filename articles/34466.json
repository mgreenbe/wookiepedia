Snapit allowed the children to cross a rope bridge to safety, then sliced it with his lightsaber.

He was one of the few survivors of the thought bomb, although he had no idea how he managed it. In reality, it was because his connection to the Force was very weak, especially after Rain left. It was later revealed that the only reason Darovit ever had any power was because of his Force bond with Rain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the thought bomb, he was drawn to the nexus of trapped souls it had created. There, he encountered Rain (now using her real name Zannah) and her Master Darth Bane. Believing Bane to be about to kill them both, Darovit drew his lightsaber against him.

When Johun Othone was overseeing the creation of the Jedi memorial on Ruusan in 990 BBY, Darovit was enraged and constantly sabotaged the construction.

When Caleb refused to heal him unless Zannah sent a message to the Jedi, revealing his presence to them, Darovit suggested that Zannah make a deal with him.

Zannah refused, knowing that Darovit was trying to get her to turn away from the dark side, but Darovit told her it was the only way Caleb would heal Bane, and eventually she agreed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Caleb healed Bane, Zannah murdered him and used her sorcery to drive Darovit insane.

After interacting with Darth Bane and his cousin Zannah at the thought bomb site his hand was exploded, but due to his isolation from the galactic society he never was able to get a cybernetic to replace it. Even though he had very little formal training he was still fairly competent. He was able to kill a handful of Jedi soldiers but since a majority of the Army of Light was built up of mostly teenage force sensitives with only a month or so of training, this was not a great display of skill. However, it still showed Darovit was capable in the field of battle. It was made clear, however, that he was no match for the Sith'ari Darth Bane, and when he fought the Jedi on Ambria, he was cut down quickly, though this was likely due to his mind having just been broken by Zannah. He was stated to be a good hunter and skilled basic weapon and stick combat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darovit was not a very powerful Force user but he was not useless. He could use the Force to augment his physical ability to the point where he could keep away from a Jedi Knight. He was able to use basic telekinesis when he was young but rarely used it.
