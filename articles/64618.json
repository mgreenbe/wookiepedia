Some automated ships used IFF broadcast streams to dictate their actions. The automated war cruiser Valiant defended Rogue Squadron pilot Tycho Celchu when he recalibrated his IFF transponder to broadcast the same beacon used by the Another Chance. IFF transponders could also be used to trick enemies into firing on each other by using an IFF transponder scramble command."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
