Avon Starros developed a distaste for it during a month-long stay on Mon Cala while her mother, Senator Ghirra Starros, was attending a summit there, as at the time it was the only dish Avon's personal droid J-6 was programmed to prepare. Later on, when Avon was stranded on the jungle moon Wevo with several others after the bombing of the Steady Wing, the food packets on the shuttle which had brought the group to the moon were all joppa stew. Luckily for Avon, Padawan Imri Cantaros had some nuna jerky rations in his pack. Avon joked several times about how much she disliked the stew as she tried to lighten Cantaros' grief over losing Jedi Master Douglas Sunvale and Honesty Weft's grief for his father, both killed in the bombing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
