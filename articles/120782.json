Sometime after a battle between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic at an Alliance hospital platform, the squadron accompanied the Muurian transport Pelican, a pirate vessel, on a mission to retrieve an Imperial Viper probe droid that had been stranded near the Saila Na system. However, the Otana, a YT-2000 light freighter flown by Alliance flight officer Ace Azzameen and his droid copilot, MK-09, entered the system with the same mission objectives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several of the R-41 Starchasers, which the Otana identified under the call sign Scavenger, broke formation to engage the intruding freighter. Two stayed with the Muurian transport, which was trying to escape with the probe droid pod. Before the Pelican could leave the system, though, Azzameen obliterated the starship and much of Scavenger. With only one R-41 Starchaser remaining, the final starfighter attempted an escape with the probe, but MK-09, controlling the Otana's turret cannons, destroyed the R-41 before it could do so. With Scavenger defeated, the Otana collected the pod and left the sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The squadron first appeared in the 1999 video game Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance, though neither the game nor its Prima Games guide give it a name beyond the Otana's designation of Scavenger.
