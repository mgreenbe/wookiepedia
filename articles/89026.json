The two had a son named Gareth by 1 BBY. That year, Mera's husband was exposed to a fatal contagion called the Blackwing virus while serving aboard the Imperial Star Destroyer Vector. At the time of the outbreak, TK329 planned on having a big party for his shoreleave home, and he believed that his wife and son supported him in his mission. Shortly before his death, TK329 transmitted an open message hoping it would reach his family. In it, he told Gareth to take care of Mera in his absence and let Mera know that he loved her.
