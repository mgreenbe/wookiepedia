In 2 ABY, Crev Bombaasa, another criminal working for Shalera the Hutt, one of Lippinoss's competitors, sent a spacer to meet with Meeko in the wilderness of Corellia. Bombaasa wished to blackmail Lippinoss with a dossier of incriminating information on her that he had compiled, but Meeko informed the spacer that Lippinoss would not deal with Bombaasa and sent the spacer back. Lippinoss subsequently hired a bounty hunter to kill Bombaasa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meeko's only appearance to date has been in Star Wars Galaxies where Meeko appears as a non-player character on Corellia. Due to the way such quests were designed by the developers, the appearance, gender and species of the NPC are different each time a player runs the mission. Therefore there's no canonical description of the character's look and gender, while Meeko's species is mentioned by Bombaasa and therefore canon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
