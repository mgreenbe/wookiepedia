In this episode, the BloodScars attacked an entire convoy with ten of their own ships, even blowing up the four ships they were primarily targeting after stripping them of goods. Casement survived the attack because his ship had an armored inner hull. He then played dead until the pirates left the scene."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
