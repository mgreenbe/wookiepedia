They were lead by a Sullustan called Cheese and in 19 BBY, they captured Rydna, a member of the Believers in the tunnel. They disliked the Believers, so they began to torture him to try and exact any knowledge from him, but they were unable to do so. The Heroes of Cularin, who were searching for a Believer stronghold, found them while they were doing this. They were able to find the location of this and the Tunnel Rats were willing to help them to co-ordinate an attack on it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
