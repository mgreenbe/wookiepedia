Following the death of the Eternal Empire Empress Vaylin and the formation of the Eternal Alliance in 3630 BBY, he joined Doctor Alirra Semhess' group of rogue Republic scientists to work on a secret project on the X7-Cratus space station. Falsely obtaining funding from a Republic endowment for disease research and treatment development, the group instead worked on developing experimental adrenals. Rahser Poth received encrypted communications fron an anonymous scientist that allowed him to develop RAK-5 serum, which in turn was refined into RS-33 adrenal. The adrenal greatly enhanced subject's strength and agility at the expense of metal faculties, but in truth both RAK-5 and RS-33 were derived from the Rakghoul plague, which put them into highly unstable state."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eternal Alliance operatives under Theron Shan eventually discovered the project and a strike team was dispatched to X7-Cratus to stop RS-33 from becoming a galactic threat.
