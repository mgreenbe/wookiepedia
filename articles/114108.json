They included defence provisions which required member worlds such as Chandrila and Alderaan to loan military assets such as starships and personnel, to the RDC when required. The assets would serve under the command of Republic officers for as long as they were needed, after which they were returned to their homeworlds. In the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace Disaster, Supreme Chancellor Lina Soh authorized Admiral Pevel Kronara to gather a fleet under the auspices of the treaties for the purpose of hunting down the Nihil, a marauder group connected to the incident. This led to the Battle of Kur."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
