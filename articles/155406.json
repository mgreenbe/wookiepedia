After boarding the Crucible, Hondo ordered that the lightsaber crystals be found and for his men to kill anyone who stood in their way. This pirate was surprised by the command and spoke out against it, due to the ship occupants being children. The protests fell to deaf ears, though ultimately the plan failed, and resulted in the Ohnaka Gang's base being destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
