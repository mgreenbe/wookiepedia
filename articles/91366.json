Leia was to contact her old history teacher, Professor Arn Horada, and use him as a starting point to establish a resistance and launch sabotage attempts against the Galactic Empire. Baron Orman Tagge stopped her soon after she had made contact, forcing her to leave the planet without completing her mission.
