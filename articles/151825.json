After the troopers arrived, Commander Wolf sent a team of two troopers along with astromech droid R2-D2 and a couple of Aleena, including this one, to repair and survey the local Republican communication station that was affected by an earthquake."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the station was fixed, this villager along with another one and a child showed R2-D2 and C-3PO a hole in the ground that led to the Aleen Underworld, but a groundquake suddenly started and the two droids fell into the hole. The other Aleena then came back to the village to warm the remaining Aleena and the clones to come to their aide. Since the clones could not understand their language, king Manchucho returned with the rest of the villagers and started praying near the site where the two droids had fallen into the ground."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the end, C-3PO and R2-D2 managed to return to the surface and realized that the gases coming from the hole in the ground were toxic, as the child standing next to the hole collapsed when he inhaled them. This Aleena helped carry the child away to cleaner air where he regained consciousness. The Aleena and the rest of the villagers then celebrated when the droids sealed up the crack leading to the underworld and bid farewell to them once they departed after their mission was over."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
