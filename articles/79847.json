Born on Socorro, he became a gambler and con man early in his life and acquired his own ship, the Millennium Falcon, in a game of sabacc with a man named Cix Trouvee. He went on to have numerous adventures with the Falcon and its piloting droid, Vuffi Raa, during which he ran afoul of a Sorcerer of Tund named Rokur Gepta, whom Calrissian eventually killed. After a series of events led to him losing the Millennium Falcon to a Corellian named Han Solo on Bespin, Calrissian eventually became the Baron Administrator of Cloud City for a time\u2014a position he once again gained through sabacc."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 ABY, Cloud City was taken over by the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War as part of a deal gone wrong. Calrissian had previously agreed to turn over a group of Rebels to the Empire, including Han Solo and Leia Organa, as part of bait for a trap for Jedi Luke Skywalker. However, Darth Vader altered the deal to the point where Calrissian felt he was no longer able to tolerate it. Subsequently, he joined the Rebel Alliance and took part in numerous missions on its behalf; in particular, the search for Han Solo, who had been frozen in carbonite due to Calrissian's betrayal on Bespin. Calrissian eventually participated in Solo's rescue and the defeat of Jabba the Hutt. Following Solo's rescue, Calrissian continued to serve with the Alliance. During the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, Calrissian piloted his old ship, the Millennium Falcon, into the second Death Star's core to destroy its reactor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Afterward, he continued to serve the newly formed New Republic in times of need, but spent most of his time pursuing various business ventures, specializing in mining. A venture on the sun-baked world of Nkllon was soured by multiple attacks from the Empire under Grand Admiral Thrawn. Calrissian also invested in a number of other entrepreneurial plans, including mining operations on Varn and Kessel. In 18 ABY, Calrissian met and fell in love with Tendra Risant, marrying her soon after the Bastion Accords were signed. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Calrissian aided the New Republic through his leadership and the YVH 1 droids that his company, Tendrando Arms, produced to combat the extragalactic invaders. He also helped to arrange the election of Cal Omas as Chief of State following the New Republic's reorganization into the Galactic Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Calrissian, along with his wife Tendra, continued to manage Tendrando Arms following the war. His YVH droids played significant roles in the subsequent Dark Nest Crisis, Swarm War, and Second Galactic Civil War. During the latter conflict, Calrissian aided his friends Han and Leia Solo in their efforts against their son Jacen Solo, who had fallen to the dark side and become a Sith, until Calrissian was informed that Tendra was pregnant; he then spent the rest of the war with her. After the war's conclusion, Calrissian settled down with Tendra in a life of quiet luxury, managing Tendrando Arms and raising his son, Lando Calrissian, Junior. He was later contacted by Luke Skywalker for assistance during a mission to the Maw with Skywalker's Sith allies. Calrissian reluctantly agreed, and successfully carried out the mission. Afterward, he returned to Coruscant and warned the Jedi of not only the danger posed by the Sith, but also the hidden menace which Skywalker and the Sith were pursuing. To that end, he assisted in getting a large number of Jedi StealthX wing starfighters offworld to assist the Skywalkers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early years"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to historians, Calrissian's early years were obscured by history and Calrissian's own fabrications. He was originally a Socorran, leaving him with a hint of a Corellian accent thanks to the Corellian origin of Socorro's settlers. His own memories pointed to his having a stable family life until at least the age of seventeen, and he had a vivid enough memory of his mother to recall her ability to memorize hundreds of songs and poems. Calrissian also had enough of a recollection of his father to remember a bit of advice given by him, \"You can't think deeper than your pockets.\" He may have had at least one brother, as evidenced by his thinking of himself as his mother's \"favorite son.\" At the age of three, Calrissian and his mother visited a city during holidays. The young Calrissian stopped to look at an animated display and lost his mother, who went away. Frightened, he wandered through the crowded streets of the city for ten minutes until he found her. This event left a deep impression on him, and he never quite trusted the universe afterward. Calrissian's occupations in his youth were broad, diverse, and temporary, as he was at various times a gambler, rogue, smuggler, mercenary, and con artist."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the age of seventeen, Calrissian had already learned to play sabacc. Once, he was able to talk a group of gamblers into letting him participate in a game at a local saloon. Lying to his parents, he ducked school and entered the competition, thus breaking several laws regarding minors. During one round, Calrissian managed to get a winning combination, sabacc, and exclaimed that he had won. However, he was not fast enough to put the cards onto the table's interference field, and they changed their values to a losing hand. Calrissian was embarrassed by this incident, although he ultimately won the game, acquiring a considerable sum of money. Calrissian worked as a con artist and gambler at sabacc tables on the moon Nar Shaddaa, transitioning smoothly into work on pleasure liners and orbital hotel resorts. After an encounter with hired thugs in relation to Calrissian's involvement with a local gangster's young attractive wife, he began travelling through the wider galaxy on pleasure liners such as the Star of Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The earliest reliable accounts possessed by Galactic Alliance historian Voren Na'al of his life dated to 4 BBY, when Calrissian was around the age of twenty-seven. Already a professional gambler, Calrissian won a battered YT-1300 freighter called the Millennium Falcon in a high stakes game of sabacc on Bespin from a man named Cix Trouvee, who was also a gambler. Calrissian won with an Idiot's Array, the best possible hand in sabacc, leaving Trouvee destitute, though the other man went on to do well for himself, eventually becoming a partner in a successful resort company. As he had no piloting experience, Calrissian sought out a Corellian smuggler and skilled pilot by the name of Han Solo, in hopes of being tutored in flying by Solo. Calrissian found Solo on Nar Shadaa being held at gunpoint by the bounty hunter Boba Fett, who had drugged Solo in preparation for collecting the bounty on the Corellian. Calrissian caught Fett by surprise, however, and drugged the bounty hunter with the obedience drug that had been used on Solo, after administering the antidote to Solo. Solo and Calrissian then ordered the entirely complacent Fett to disarm himself and fly his ship off to unknown space. Afterward, Solo eagerly taught Calrissian the basics of starship piloting. For some time, Calrissian flew several various smuggling runs, sometimes partnered with smuggler Salla Zend. Calrissian eventually parted ways with Zend and used his new piloting knowledge to fly the Falcon to the Centrality."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Adventures in the Centrality"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Mindharp of Sharu"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Taking the advice of spaceport attendants, Calrissian flew to the asteroid Oseon 2795, a decision he almost immediately regretted, as significant fees were levied against him there. To gain the funds he needed to leave, he played sabacc with an assortment of locals as well as a man named Osuno Whett. From Whett, he won the title to a Class Two droid named Vuffi Raa, but was told he had travel to Rafa IV to actually take possession. Calrissian was incensed, but was unable to press the issue as one of his tablemates, T. Lund Phuna, falsely accused him of cheating. While the rest of the table defended him, Calrissian was forced to make an immediate departure with his winnings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From Oseon, Calrissian traveled to the Rafa system, which was littered with brightly colored buildings that were the remnants of the ancient Sharu race. Landing in the city of Teguta Lusat, he found a sabacc game that night in a bar named the Spaceman's Rest, and won an illegal cargo of life-crystals. Calrissian picked up Vuffi Raa on his way back to his inn, the Hotel Sharu. However, during the night he was arrested for acquiring an unlicensed cargo and other trumped up charges, beaten, and taken to see local governor Duttes Mer. Mer was working with Rokur Gepta, a Sorcerer of Tund. Both sought the Ultimate Instrument of Music, also known as the Mindharp of Sharu, and thought Calrissian was the one who could find it for them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Calrissian agreed to assist them in exchange for his freedom and a cargo of life-crystals. Gepta gave Calrissian a peculiar artifact thought to be a key to the secret of the Mindharp, but no other clues, and told him to find it. The gambler then decided to search for information in local drinking establishments. During his investigations, he discovered an ancient being named Mohs, who was High Singer of the native Toka species. Mohs hailed him as the Key Bearer that had been foretold, before trying to steal Calrissian's artifact for himself. Calrissian ran down and subdued Mohs, who agreed to aid him and directed the gambler to the largest Sharu pyramid in the Rafa system, located on the planet Rafa V."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After arriving on Rafa V, Calrissian was ambushed by numerous bow-wielding Toka who captured him and shot Vuffi Raa. Mohs took command of the newcomers, and ordered them to march Calrissian to a life-orchard and tie him to one of the crystalline lifetrees in the hope that he would freeze during the night. Despite the lifetree robbing him of intelligent thought, Calrissian was able to free himself. However, he was then accosted by a group of men led by Captain Myle Jandler, a law enforcement officer in the service of Duttes Mer. Calrissian was freezing and barely clothed at the time, in no position resist them, but they were intimidated into surrendering by a recovered Vuffi Raa piloting the Millennium Falcon. Jandler's ship was then dispatched by Vuffi Raa on autopilot for Rafa XI with Jandler and his men aboard, so that they would not bother the adventurers further."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a result of his night in the life-orchard, Calrissian's feet were severely frostbitten and required treatment in a portable gel-bath kept on the Millennium Falcon. After the gambler had recovered, he and Vuffi Raa investigated the largest pyramid, thinking that they contained the lock that Calrissian's artifact, actually a key, was made for. There they found Mohs, who begged their forgiveness and directed them to the Great Lock located underground on the side of the pyramid. Calrissian inserted the Key he had been given into the Lock. Nothing happened at first, but then the three of them were transported inside the pyramid. However, inside the pyramid Calrissian and Mohs were sixty times their usual height, though Vuffi Raa remained the same size. In addition, Mohs lost his eyes in his journey into the pyramid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Calrissian and Vuffi Raa followed a moving walkway down deep beneath the pyramid. As they traveled, Calrissian and Mohs began to shrink down to their normal sizes, though Mohs mysteriously disappeared before the end of their journey. At the end of the hallway, Calrissian and Vuffi Raa found the Mindharp inside a Hall. The Hall spoke to them and told them not to cross the floor to the Mindharp, but the two did anyway. Calrissian then retrieved the Mindharp with the assistance of Hall. He and Vuffi Raa were then promptly teleported back to Rafa IV. While not much time had passed from Calrissian's perspective, months had passed in the rest of the galaxy. The abandoned Millennium Falcon had been returned to Teguta Lusat by Duttes Mer. Rokur Gepta was with his forces around Rafa V, still waiting for Calrissian to emerge from the pyramid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vuffi Raa, who had been programmed to betray Calrissian before he had even been \"won,\" promptly turned Calrissian over to Governor Mer. Mer greedily took the Mindharp and sentenced Calrissian to a lifetime of hard labor. However, Vuffi Raa, having fulfilled his imperative to betray Calrissian, rescued the gambler just as Mer activated the Mindharp. The two encountered Mohs once more, now better dressed, on the ramp of the Millennium Falcon. Mohs assured Calrissian that everything was under control, and that all the Toka were becoming Sharu once again. Calrissian fled Rafa IV as the great pyramids of the Rafa system crumbled, leaving alien cities in their wake. Rokur Gepta, who had not reached Rafa IV fast enough to prevent Mer from activating the Mindharp, tried to stop the Falcon with his scoutship. However, Gepta's craft was disabled by an exploding Sharu obelisk. As it turned out, the Mindharp had been the key to re-awakening the Sharu from a self-induced period of technological regression lasting centuries that had led them to becoming the primitive Toka. However, with the Mindharp activated, they were rising again, much to the displeasure of Rokur Gepta."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leaving the restored planet, Calrissian and Vuffi Raa entered hyperspace with a cargo hold full of the last Rafa life-crystals to leave the system, as the Sharu shut off all trade from the planet soon after his departure. This valuable cargo netted Calrissian nearly 250,000 credits. After returning to Nar Shaddaa, he bought a used-starship lot from a Duros. To his dismay, he discovered the business was expensive and difficult to run. He debated whether he should either sell it or keep running it when the Galactic Empire decided to send a fleet into the criminal-ridden system intent on destroying Nar Shaddaa. To fight the intruders, Calrissian donated his inventory of ships to his fellow outlaws. He and Vuffi Raa then piloted the Millennium Falcon deftly in the resulting Battle of Nar Shaddaa, flying alongside noted smugglers such as Salla Zend, Han Solo, and Mako Spince. The attack was diverted, but at its conclusion less than ten percent of his stock was still spaceworthy. As a result, Calrissian sold 90 percent ownership in what was left of his lot to a man named Roa at a loss."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime during this period, Solo introduced Calrissian to the Tonnika sisters. Solo had come to know the sisters through his dealings with crime lord Jabba the Hutt, and persuaded them to help him play a trick on Calrissian. Solo arranged for him to meet \"Bresenni\" (an alias the sisters used when masquerading as only one woman) in The High Stakes Casino on the planet Balfron. Although Calrissian thought that his new \"girlfriend\" suffered from severe personality shifts as the sisters swapped around in the role, he genuinely believed that he was growing close to the woman when Brea and Senni revealed the deception. As he watched a holo-message from Solo, Calrissian was at first dejected and angry, but quickly softened, although he vowed to get even with him for the stunt. Calrissian later had dealings with the Sisters on at least one other occasion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Calrissian's successes in sabacc also enabled him to free Ryst\u00e1ll Sant from her slavery to Black Sun.

In order to raise the ten thousand credit buy-in, Calrissian and Vuffi Raa returned to the Centrality and attempted to haul legitimate cargo. However, tariffs, fees, and licensing cost him more than he made, leaving him with nothing and boring Calrissian considerably. While carrying a cargo to the agricultural world of Dilonexa XXIII, Calrissian used a short cut through a nebula, only to be attacked by pirates. Though he was able to use the Millennium Falcon's guns to defeat the pirates, the effort cost him considerably in time and power. Furthermore, upon arrival on Dilonexa XXIII, Calrissian found that his cargo\u2014fishing poles, wintenberry jelly, and hides\u2014was not only utterly unmarketable, but also subject to hefty import duties. The only thing Calrissian found useful from the trip was an invitation to play sabacc in the Oseon system during the arising of the Flamewind. However, Calrissian and Vuffi Raa also had to deal with the fact that several attempts had been made on Calrissian's life\u2014such as two poorly executed bombings of the Millennium Falcon en route to Oseon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after arriving at Oseon 6845, while playing sabacc with a number of individuals, including the Administrator Senior of the Oseon system, Lob Doluff, Calrissian received a message that the Millennium Falcon was on fire. Upon arriving at his ship, he found nothing, though, and, somewhat puzzled by the false alarm, decided to return to his game. Before he could do so, Calrissian was assaulted and forced to shoot his assailant in self-defense with his stingbeam. Doluff then imprisoned the gambler and informed Calrissian that the penalty for possessing a deadly weapon was death by exposure. However, since the administrator admired Calrissian, he offered a solution to avoid execution. Doluff arranged for Calrissian to participate in a drug bust against the wealthy lesai-addicted industrialist Bohhuah Mutdah. Posing as Mutdah's dealer, Calrissian transported two agents, Bassi Vobah and Waywa Fybot, through the radiation of the Flamewind to Mutdah's location on Oseon 5792. From there, Doluff assured Calrissian, he could leave Oseon free and clear. Doluff gave thorough instructions to Fybot and Vobah to leave Calrissian untouched, though none of them liked each other. Calrissian therefore raised ship with the two agents and made his way through the stellar radiation storm of the Flamewind. As they flew through the maddening radiation fields, the Millennium Falcon once again came under attack, this time from Klyn Shanga, the leader of a group of Renatasian fighters, who were after Vuffi Raa. Calrissian shot down some of the fighters and outran the rest, setting down on an asteroid for repairs. While he was working on the ship, though, someone sabotaged his pressure suit, nearly killing him. Furthermore, the fighters eventually found them, and with Vuffi Raa's piloting skills rendered useless by the radiation, Calrissian had to fly the ship himself\u2014after securing the two agents so that they could not make any more attempts on his life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arrival on Mutdah's estate on Oseon 5792, Calrissian was escorted by a pair of security guards to Mutdah's presence, where he delivered the lesai to the trillionaire. After he was paid, the two agents burst in, intent on arresting Mutdah. Unfortunately for Calrissian, Mutdah, who turned out to be Rokur Gepta in disguise, promptly killed Fybot (who, himself, was corrupt and had killed Vobah on \"Mutdah's\" orders) and planned to kill Calrissian\u2014slowly\u2014for the humiliation the gambler had given him on Rafa. Gepta forced the gambler to endure torture by chagrin, which made him relive all the painful moments of his life. However, Calrissian was saved by the timely intervention of attacking Renatasian starfighters, whose goal was to kill Vuffi Raa. During the impending chaos surrounding the attack, Calrissian escaped and grabbed Mutdah's drug payment: a whole twenty million credits. As he was outbound from Oseon 5792, Calrissian's ship was boarded by the last remaining Renatasian fighter, manned by Klyn Shanga. Calrissian subdued the man after Shanga tried to attack Vuffi Raa, and had him explain his side of the story. In turn, though, Shanga explained that he believed Vuffi Raa to be the destroyer of his world, dubbed the \"Butcher of Renatasia.\" Calrissian disbelieved him, though, and kept him confined, dropping him off at a nearby world to do as he wished. Calrissian deposited small sums in banks on several worlds, including fifty thousand credits into the Bank of Aargau, which he planned to use for covering the entry fee for the Bespin sabacc tournament. Unfortunately, his attempt to deposit the bulk of the money on the Centrality's primary financial planet, Dela III, was interrupted by a pirate attack by the \"pirate queen\" Drea Renthal. Despite Calrissian's charm, Renthal took a large fraction of Mutdah's money from him."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Saving the Starcave of ThonBoka"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "All the while, Calrissian and his droid continued to suffer from revenge attempts from both Gepta and the Renatassian avengers. One assassin tried to kill the two by throwing a fragmentation grenade at them, however, he accidentally threw the pin instead of the grenade and only slightly damaged Vuffi Raa. In another incident, which, as Calrissian suspected, had been orchestrated by Vuffi Raa's enemies, he had been pushed over a rail into a vat of vitamin paste he had considered acquiring for that very trip, and he had fractured both an arm and a toe. In addition to being the targets of their sworn enemies, Calrissian and his droid were also forced to fend off occasional pirate attacks, during one of which, a fighter rammed the Falcon and damaged its boarding ramp. On the other hand, the defeated pirates were giving the Falcon quite a reputation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon after, Calrissian encountered Lehesu, a young member of the space-dwelling, hyperjump-capable Oswaft species. Lehesu's curiosity had carried him from his home in the ThonBoka Nebula to a desolate part of the Centrality, where there were no deep space materials for him to ingest. The starving Oswaft came in contact with the Millennium Falcon, which Calrissian had brought out of hyperspace in deep space to recalibrate its engine. After several halting attempts at communication, Lehesu finally conveyed his need for sustenance. Calrissian emptied the contents of the ship's recyclers into space, which Lehesu eagerly gobbled up. The gambler and the droid then cobbled together a tank full of nutrients that Lehesu could carry with him, so that he could get home. Lehesu then rewarded them with synthesized gemstones."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Lehesu did not return home immediately. While exploring other star systems, he came to the attention of the Empire when he accidentally destroyed several fighters. The Empire tracked him to his nebula home, and some months later, blockaded the entrance to the sack-shaped ThonBoka with five hundred capital ships. The fleet's orders were to cut off nutrients and starve the entire Oswaft race into extinction. Some of the ships were Carrack-class light cruisers that were modified to contaminate the \"interstellar plankton\" drifting into the nebula. Lehesu then used a transceiver provided to him by Vuffi Raa to contact the Millennium Falcon and plead for help."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Calrissian, meanwhile, had been getting into problems of his own. Rokur Gepta was still trying to kill him, and on top of that Klyn Shanga, the leader of the Renatasians that had attacked on Oseon, was still trying to kill Vuffi Raa. Since Gepta's agents occasionally also targeted Vuffi Raa, and Shanga's Renatasians sometimes went after Calrissian, the months after Calrissian encountered Lehesu were eventful. Several bombs were planted inside the Millennium Falcon, she was rammed by a fighter, Calrissian broke his arm after being pushed into a vat of vitamin paste, and an assassin serving Rokur Gepta tried to kill Vuffi Raa with a fragmentation grenade. In addition, the ship had been harassed by pirates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Calrissian, seeing in the plight of the Oswaft a lucrative solution to his own problems, raced to the rescue. When stopped by the blockade, Calrissian used the ruse that he was a trader plying his wares. Because no one below the rank of admiral had been informed of the reason behind the blockade, the Falcon was inspected and then allowed to continue traveling from ship to ship. The Imperials failed to realize that the ship's real cargo was nothing more than the ordinary waste carried in its trash and toilet recyclers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After working his way through the ships in the blockade, selling cigars and playing sabacc as he went, Calrissian made a break for the mouth of the ThonBoka. Once inside, his damaged craft was discovered by Lehesu. Calrissian dispensed some of his recycler cargo to the hungry Oswaft and then went to meet with the Oswaft leaders in the Cave of Elders. While he spoke to the elders, an Oswaft delegation under the command of Bhoggihalysahonues went to negotiate with the fleet. An accidental altercation took place, and the Oswaft destroyed the unshielded cruiser Courteous, with their maser voice-streams. The fleet, seeking retribution, raised their shields and began to enter the nebula, but were called back by Rokur Gepta, who wished them to wait until his flagship, the Wennis, arrived."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Gepta arrived, accompanied by Klyn Shanga and his Renatasian fighter squadron, the fleet re-mobilized and entered the nebula. Fortunately, the suspension of hostilities had given Calrissian time to suggest a battle plan. Confronting the Imperial ships, the Oswaft excreted heavy metals from their pores and then jumped to hyperspace, leaving decoy Oswaft outlines placed between the enemy cruisers. The Imperials fired at the Oswaft and decoys, taking casualties from friendly fire. Meanwhile, the Oswaft \"shouted\" at the starfighters, destroying them with their maser voice-streams as the spacefaring beings swarmed around the blockade ships, vastly outnumbering them.

The Sorcerer's form withered, but he hit Vuffi Raa, who had attempted to strangle him with his tentacles, with a final shot.

Out of nowhere, a multitude of fifty-kilometer diameter sentient droids suddenly appeared, demanding on all channels \"Cease fire immediately or be destroyed!\" They were the Silentium, the creators of Vuffi Raa, and they had come for their offspring. The Imperial fleet, faced with thousands of these immense ships, retreated. Vuffi Raa's progenitors repaired the little droid and departed with him into the Unknown Regions after playing a game of sabacc with Calrissian.

Holonet News reported how Calrissian, with the aid of a droid named Flek, masqueraded as a ronin Jedi Knight in an attempt to scam the Meek people, who wanted him to slay a rancor. Calrissian knew that the rancor in the area had already been slain by poachers, so he used a rancor's tooth and a recorded rancor's cry as proof of his combat with the beast. However, while out in the woods, he was surprised to find that there was another rancor. Having heard that rancors were incapable of swimming, he jumped into a nearby lake. Before the rancor could wander off, though, he attracted its attention with the decoy rancor cry and then tossed the decoy into the water, hoping to lure the rancor to its doom. To his surprise and dismay, the rancor swam off. Nevertheless, Calrissian returned to the Meek village and collected his reward of valuable artifacts from the Meeks for having allegedly slain the rancor, but later found out that he had been given fakes. He successfully defrauded the governor of Pesmenben IV and later replaced the Falcon with the sleek Cobra. Free from any permanent investments to tie him down, he also spent a lot of time on cruise ships, slowly acquiring money through card games and sabacc. While traveling on the Queen of Empire, Calrissian encountered Bria Tharen\u2014a Rebel agent and Han Solo's former girlfriend. He tried to strike up an acquaintance with her, but was captured by Boba Fett along with Tharen, who had a bounty on her head.

Tharen's Red Hand Squadron had desired to gain recruits and spice from a raid on the Ylesia colonies, but needed skilled pilots to bring her forces to the surface. Consequently, Solo recruited several smugglers for the strike, including Calrissian, to pilot the Rebels through Ylesia's turbulent atmosphere and then help defeat the guards. As incentive for their participation, Tharen promised the smugglers that they would share in captured plunder from the Ylesian operations. After meeting unexpectedly stiff resistance, they eventually were successful in destroying the Hutt operation and freeing the slaves.

The chase pitted him against some of the underworld's most notorious bounty hunters, sent by Malta the Hutt, including Bossk, Dengar, and IG-88B. Unfortunately, it also threw him in unwilling partnership with Han Solo again, which made for an uneasy alliance following the recent Ylesian spice fiasco. Since the rewards were considerable, they managed through it, bickering most of the way. In time, however, all parties realized they were being used again. This time, it was one of the Hutts' assistants, a woman named Jozzel Moffet, who was manipulating them. Unknowingly, this assistant was being directed by none other than Bria Tharen herself on behalf of the Rebellion. The Vassilika was the key to opening a Massassi temple, a place that would become a strategic Rebel outpost once opened.

However, this was revealed to be due to the actions of a furious enemy of Calrissian's, Barpotomous Drebble, who had planted a skifter in the deck to throw the game to Raynor, in a form of revenge on Calrissian for the gambler's winning large sums of money from Drebble. Raynor ordered Drebble removed, but refused to discount the game. Because an anonymous benefactor then advanced Calrissian five million credits, the gambler bet four million and his lot on Nar Shaddaa against Raynor's administrator's post, and won not only his ship back, but the whole game and became the new Baron Administrator of Cloud City.

Admitting to Thune that it was completely harmless to her, Calrissian did, though, tell her that the kessum would be impossible for her to locate, but it would allow him and Baobab to be aware if she ever came within a light-year of either of them. Calrissian and Baobab then hired Thune for a small fee to track down Raynor and capture him and bring him to justice for the attack he had planned on Cloud City.

Calrissian changed the system to allow more oversight of the Wing Guard by the Baron-Administrator and made their pay dependent on how well they were doing at maintaining order,. as well as enhancing their pay structure and making Lobot also a liaison to the security forces.

However, he did not fully remove some of the rowdier areas, feeling that as long as the individuals there kept to that location, they could be easily contained. He also allowed a separate policing division to be formed by the more lawless district of Port Town. This provided a responsible, accountable security force to be in place, but also one with more leniency than the Wing Guard and a tendency to look the other way on certain activities within Port Town. Calrissian also stepped in to arbitrate a series of turf wars between employees of Jabba the Hutt and a rival crimelord based on Cloud City, Wonn Ionstrike.

In the article, Armstrong commented on the fact that Calrissian was the first major black character to be introduced to the Star Wars universe, pointing out that earlier social critics had noted a lack of racial diversity in the saga. Armstrong also described Calrissian as \"the swaggering, jive-talking, morally ambiguous leader of the Cloud City of Bespin.\" For his part, Williams refuted claims that the role was written with race in mind, stating that \"The reason I was attracted to this role was because it wasn't written for a black person.\" This same sentiment, that the character of Calrissian was not intended to draw attention to race in the galaxy far, far away, was also echoed by Sidney Ganis, the vice-president of Lucasfilm at the time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In August 2001, in another interview conducted with Star Wars Insider, Williams discussed why he believed that the character of Lando Calrissian was so successful within the world of Star Wars. His reasoning was simple and to the point: he believed that Calrissian was a man who was devoid of the typical clich\u00e9s associated with similar characters; that he was good because the fans did not really know which way he was originally going to go; that there was a little bit of uncertainty that surrounded Calrissian, the kind that one might attribute a villain, but that it was that ambiguity that made the whole character that much more interesting. Also, Williams commented, the successes that were experienced with Lando Calrissian were positive because he was a character that everyone could relate to, in one way or another. It was this intrepid character that Williams admitted allowed his acting career to really take off; Lando gave Williams a huge, otherwise untouched, fan base that he commented would never go away because he believes that the Star Wars films have a touch of immortality to them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On a trip to Australia to attend Star Wars-related conventions in 2007, Williams was interviewed by the Courier Mail. During the interview, the subject of Calrissian's betrayal of Han Solo was brought up, and Williams replied that Calrissian wasn't \"a double crosser.\" Williams went on to say that he had had to make a similar defense of the character over the decades since The Empire Strikes Back was filmed, to the point where children would ask him why he betrayed Solo when Williams was picking up his daughter from elementary school. Another example Williams gave was having to justify Calrissian's life to an airplane stewardess. Defending Calrissian, Williams gave the explanation that \"He had to figure out a way to hold on to what he had created for himself and at the same time prevent the complete demise of a friend.\" Williams also admitted that he was aware that Calrissian, and to some extent himself, was typecast as a \"cool character,\" but that he was fine with that, saying \"Obviously I think I have this persona, and the persona is based on character attributes or flaws, so I have to live with it.\" Likewise, during an interview with Star Wars Insider, Williams recalled how casting wanted Calrissian's character to be a dashing, swashbuckling space entrepreneur, and how he now could understand why they chose him for the part\u2014because he had all those qualities, thus allowing for a more convincing Lando to be played. When interviewed for the documentary Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy, Williams stated that \"it's always interesting to create a character, that has two-you know, just sort of dual character. You know, you're not really sure about him, especially if he's cute, and I was really kind of cute\" in reference to Calrissian."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When interviewed by fansite Lightsabre.co.uk in 2007 about his experiences portraying Lando Calrissian in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Williams said that working on Star Wars was quite exciting.

Williams also said that had he had agreed to work on the films after being impressed with one of Lucas's earlier films, THX-1138. Williams denied any claims that Calrissian was written with him in mind, saying that he wanted to move beyond the idea of racial or ethnic thinking. In Williams's mind, Calrissian was an epic hero and had no concept of racial barriers, repeating his comments about the character not being drawn up with race in mind. He also particularly enjoyed the cape part of the costume that he wore as Calrissian."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the same interview, a mention was made of an alleged scene where Carrie Fisher, as Leia Organa, was supposed to have gotten annoyed at Lando and slapped him. Rumor had it that Fisher had forgotten to telegraph the slap and had actually hit Williams, but Williams had no recollection of the incident, saying that he couldn't remember being hit, but did recall constantly flirting with Fisher as part of his \"very charming\" character. Williams also said that he wished there had been more time to flesh out Calrissian's adventures in the movies, but recognized that the destiny of Luke Skywalker was the primary focus of the trilogy. However, he was also pleased with how the character of Calrissian had evolved to become a Rebel hero, and said, though he believed the possibility of playing Calrissian again to be highly unlikely, he would not rule out taking on the role again, were Calrissian being played as \"an older gentleman who still 'has it', to some degree.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Also in 2007, Williams was interviewed by Will Harris of Bullz-Eye.com regarding his role in the soap opera Night Shift.

In an interview with Lightsabre.co.uk, Smith stated that when writing the books, he found that seeing an image of Calrissian without his mustache helped him get the characterization of a young Lando Calrissian down better. Smith was drawn to the character because he was a \"gambler and a wheeler-dealer\", qualities which he had also admired in Han Solo, of whom he was also a fan. In his books, Smith sought to portray Calrissian as a younger gambler and con artist still learning his trade. Discussing the events on Bespin during The Empire Strikes Back, Smith also said that he thought Calrissian would not have viewed the situation as a predicament, but rather a \"problem that could be solved by a sufficiently intelligent con-man.\" In another interview, Smith explained that he was asked to write the books by Del Rey Books on behalf of Lucasfilm. He was ordered by his editors at Lucasfilm to keep his libertarian politics out of the trilogy, but ultimately \"decided that I'd make the books as political as I could until the editors squeaked.

At the time Anderson was writing his first books in The Jedi Academy Trilogy, the events of The Last Command had yet to play out, and the future of Luke Skywalker's and Mara Jade's relationship was uncertain. Anderson later indicated in an interview with AlternativeNation.net that he was toying with the idea of killing off Lando, noting the character had run his course for Expanded Universe authors at the time."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "In popular culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars Insider 67 there is an article which deals with a large number of little-known facts, details, and other trivia-type information concerning the film Return of the Jedi.
