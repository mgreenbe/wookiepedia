He denied the charges, but the evidence was overwhelming against him. He was found guilty, and vilified for lying. He fled from planet to planet, pursued at first by Defel hunters, then local law enforcement, the Empire, and bounty hunters since he had committed other crimes during his flight. He gained temporary refuge on a remote planet when his starship crashed, and developed a taste for freshly killed meat."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "In the service of Moff Sarne"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, he landed on Kal'Shebbol, and was captured by Moff Sarne's forces. Instead of trying him for his crimes, Sarne offered him a deal. In exchange for protecting him and feeding his new found hunger, Kl'aal would serve as his personal assassin. Kl'aal agreed, but he felt his conscience would be tainted forever. He was put to work killing threats to Sarne and eliminating known members of local resistance groups."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to the New Republic's liberation of Kal'Shebbol, Kl'aal was recruited by Katarn Commandos pathfinder Lilla Dade to assist her in her mission to scout out Moff Sarne's base.

He also felt that they, like him, had personal reasons for joining the mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kl'aal kept to himself while onboard the FarStar, preferring not to get involved in shipboard matters. No member of the crew knew where Kl'aal slept on the ship, and generally assumed that he hid in a quiet corner.
