One model was used by the Galactic Republic during the Great Galactic War. The guns were used by the Republic during the Invasion of Begeren alongside Cacophanizer Shells. They were used to destroy squads three, eight, and fifteen of the Sith Empire's attack force. They also pinned down squad seventeen and Qawohl. They were presumably destroyed or captured when the Sith Empire won the battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quad laser cannon turrets were equipped onto the Millennium Falcon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
