As the peace brought by the Treaty of Coruscant collapsed into open war, the Sith Lord Darth Decimus led an invasion force to the prestigious Core World, sparking a lengthy fight for control. Darth Decimus's invasion force descended on the planet after months of planning and the forming of alliances with the Corellian Council, who declared Corellia's allegiance to the Empire as the Imperials arrived in the world's skies. However, pockets of civilian resistance soon began to spring up, organized by the Corellian Security Force and the native Green Jedi, and the Empire quickly discovered that the Corellians would not accept Imperial rule so easily."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under the command of Darth Decimus, Darth Acharon and Darth Hadra, the Imperial Military and the Imperial Guard began to crush the native resistance, but the forces of the Republic soon arrived and established a foothold in the Blastfield Shipyards on the outskirts of Corellia's capital, Coronet City. The once pristine metropolis, already ravaged by war, quickly became a battlefield as Republic and Imperial forces fought for control, with both sides aided by native corporations and groups of mercenaries. Both forces suffered heavy losses as the conflict continued, with powerful Jedi and Sith falling to battle and betrayal\u2014but Darth Decimus believed victory was within his grasp after Jedi Master Arfan Ramos and the rest of the Green Jedi Council were killed when an Imperial strike force stormed the Green Jedi Enclave."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under the leadership of the Jedi Knight known as the Hero of Tython, the Jedi forces on Corellia rallied and halted a plot by the fallen Jedi Master Tol Braga to massacre millions of civilians and soldiers. With victory in sight, Jedi Grand Master Satele Shan and Republic High Command pulled some of their forces off the planet to aid in an all-out assault on the Imperial capital of Dromund Kaas, but even with the reduced troops the Republic was still able to push the Empire on the defensive. The Republic's efforts were aided immensely when the elite Special Forces unit Havoc Squad led an all-out assault on the Bastion\u2014a Republic military complex that had served as one of the military's main centers of operations before its capture early in the invasion\u2014and successfully retook the base, capturing General Arkos Rakton in the process. The Barsen'thor of the Jedi Order brought the full might of the Rift Alliance to the Republic's aid, with Voss commandos, Esh-kha, and Balmorran droids fighting to reclaim the fortresses known as the Guardian Holds from the Children of the Emperor\u2014secret agents of the Emperor scattered throughout the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The height of the battle saw Darths Acharon and Hadra killed by Republic strike teams, and with the loss of the inside knowledge provided by the Corellian Council\u2014many of whom defected to the Republic or were killed during the battle\u2014the Imperial offensive began to lose cohesion and direction. After securing Axial Park and pushing through the Imperial presence in the Government District, a Republic strike force attacked the Legislature Building and defeated Darth Decimus in the process, signalling the death blow to the Empire's forces on the planet. Supreme Chancellor Dorian Janarus was assassinated aboard his personal flagship during the long battle, but his successor Leontyne Saresh received the formal declaration of victory by General Aves to the Senate.

Agents of Imperial Intelligence identified potential turncoats in the highest levels of the planet's government and secretly recruited them, promising the politicians lifetime power in return for loyalty, and the Empire soon had almost the entirety of the planet's ruling Corellian Council in its pocket. Darbin Sull, one of the youngest individuals ever elected to the council, was quick to pledge loyalty to the Empire when they promised him the position of prime minister in return\u2014something they refrained from informing the current Imperial-allied prime minister, Cal Falcone. Councilor Belos agreed to aid the Empire out of a belief that their superior military might would inevitably overwhelm the Republic, while Councilor Caicos used a combination of bribes, blackmail, and threats to convince the other council members to back the Empire when the Imperial admiral known as the Voidwolf called in a debt. The First Son of the Sith Emperor helped convince the Council to join the Empire by revealing his identity as Syo Bakarn, a Jedi Master and member of the Jedi Council, to Secretary Nadien as an example of his power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 3642 BBY, the tenuous peace brought by Treaty of Coruscant shattered under the stress of multiple conflicts, both internal and external, amongst the Republic and the Empire. Seeing an opening, Decimus put his plans in motion: Imperial Intelligence agents attempted to infiltrate the offices of the Corellian Engineering Corporation in order to seize control of the complex's powerful defense systems and halt any possible resistance. However, Intelligence's operatives disappeared after entering the offices, and CEC's defenses remained under the corporation's control when Decimus ordered the invasion to proceed as planned around 3640 BBY. Launching a fleet from the heart of the Empire, he signaled the Corellian Council to make their move. The politicians declared a fake emergency that cleared all hyperlanes into the Corellian system, shut down the planet's spaceports, and convened in the Government District of Coronet City for a meeting. There, the Council unanimously voted to submit to Imperial control just as Darth Decimus's fleet arrived above the capital city."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The invasion"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Seizing Coronet City"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Corellian Council capitulated to the Empire, Decimus's forces attempted to conquer the planet anyway as a show of force. All communications were immediately cut, leaving the Republic unaware of the Imperial invasion. An initial attack on the capital of Coronet City shattered sections of the fabled Coronet Zoo, releasing alien wildlife into the streets of the city. One of the Empire's primary targets was the district known as the Incorporation Islands. A series of towers occupied by Corellia's largest corporate entities, the sector quickly became a battleground as corporate security forces fought back against the Empire aided by armies of droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bastion, a massive military complex in Coronet City, was a stronghold of resistance that served as the center of operations for the entire Republic military. Therefore, it was a prime target for Imperial conquest in the eyes of General Arkos Rakton, and part of the Imperial invasion involved the reformation of an elite black ops team under the command of Lieutenant Pierce. Pierce's unit, including Captain Lorant, Sergeant Arlos, Lieutenant Tanido, and several other soldiers, infiltrated a Republic shuttle carrying reinforcements to the Bastion mere hours before Darth Decimus's forces arrived in-system, and the team had complete control of the complex a few hours later. Axial Park was the target of an Imperial force led by the Sith Emperor's own personal Guard, and the captured Museum Republica quickly became an Imperial base of operations in the park. One of the city's high-rise towers was clipped by a damaged Imperial warship, and the near-collapse of the structure killed the founder of the Beharen Droid Factory. Fortunately for the Republic, Syo Bakarn was able to fortify several buildings known as Guardian Holds with elite Republic troops, munition stores, bunkers, and other military assets, and the Holds withstood all Imperial attacks through the long invasion. However, the First Son used his identity of Bakarn to place several Children of the Emperor within the Holds."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Resistance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the Corellians were not a culture to submit to Imperial dominance so quickly. As Darth Decimus made his headquarters in the offices of Corellia's Trade Tariff Service at the advice of his lieutenant, Moff Tarandon, the Corellian Security Force immediately realized it would not survive an all-out war with the invaders. Therefore, CorSec commissioner Jonah Carter and his lieutenants sent out a panic alert to all officers, sending them underground, and began to prepare for war. However, some CorSec officers, like Raddus Venn, willingly submitted to the Empire and began to aid the planet's new rulers. Coronet Durasteel immediately joined the Empire at the beginning of the invasion, and it was followed by corporations like Horizon Enterprises, led by its Senior Executive President Erin Kaldo. However, while the Board of Directors and the rest of the company's upper management were willing to work with the Empire, Horizon's workforce had begun to rebel the moment they learned the Empire arrived. Kaldo and the directors were forced to call in Imperial help to \"reduce\" the workforce, hoping that the elimination of a number of workers would convince the others to see reason and submit to Imperial rule."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Normal citizens began to band together with freighter crews and unemployed mercenaries in an effort to strike back against their new rulers, and with coordination and training by CorSec the rebels proved highly successful in the early days of the occupation. Over a dozen high-ranking Imperial officers were assassinated, and the group bombed many of the shipyards that the Empire was using as landing pads; rebels would often pretend to cooperate with the invaders in order to access Imperial bases and wreak havoc. A major target of the Empire's first strikes was the enclave of the Green Jedi, a group of Corellian Jedi who wore green cloaks to symbolize the fact that they valued their loyalty to their native world over that of the Republic. A first attempt to bombard the structure was halted by the Enclave's powerful shields, powered by internal reactors, and the Green Jedi quickly erected offensive weapons emplacements. The Imperial warship sent to attack the Enclave a second time was shot down by the base's defenses, and the section of the vessel that did strike the structure failed to weaken it or inflict heavy casualties. The Green Jedi's leader, Arfan Ramos, quickly allied with the resistance and the group began aiding their fellow Corellians in the fight against the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another stronghold of resistance was the CorSec Maximum Security Prison. CorSec forces under the command of Wolroff had secured the facility for use as a staging area for attacking the Empire, and many of the prisoners had agreed to aid the police in exchange for a shortened sentence. However, the Empire had gained intelligence on the prison's extensive security systems from a captured program\u2014the systems now ignored CorSec personnel and only attacked Imperial forces, but an assault team could reprogram the systems at certain control nodes. This covert assault was successful in their mission, causing the prison security systems to inflict heavy enough losses to drive out the CorSec presence, and the unit also managed to eliminate Wolroff in the process."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Fighting back"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite small errors, the Imperial invasion was progressing almost perfectly until rebels knocked out Coronet City's rocket tram system, which the invaders had been using to quickly move their troops.

Fighting soon began to erupt in the Incorporation Islands as powerful companies began aiding those Corellians who resisted the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon learning of the situation with the rocket trams, Darth Decimus ordered his subordinate Darth Charnus to rectify the problem. At the Sith Lord's directive, Imperial operatives struck a blow against the Czerka Corporation by eliminating several of its weapon caches in the Incorporation Islands as part of an operation to seize the company's hull-cracker explosive weapon. Charnus continued to direct operations from orbit aboard his flagship, the Tears of Taris, and directed a strike force to aid Commander Jastal at Imperial Outpost Alpha in the Imperial Guard's attempt to retrieve the hull-cracker. After retrieving the codes for the weapon from the Czerka employee Brall Tavar, the strike team seized the hull-cracker and prepared to use it against the Corellian Engineering Corporation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By disabling two of CEC's signal towers, the Imperial operatives shut down the corporation's massive army of security droids, and Commander Jastal initiated his siege of the CEC complex.

Commander Krade and Charnus's forces defended Imperial explosives experts while they planted charges, and the Sith Lord's operatives stormed the company board room itself. After defeating the prototype C-9X droid sent by Maas, the Imperial forces killed the CEC board and overloaded the ion cannons targeting the rocket trams."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A major rebel assault on the occupation forces was averted when the Imperial agent Hazeen, who had infiltrated the resistance, managed to alert other Imperials through the probe droid G-05 to the rebels' dead drops of intel and thereby put a stop to the attack. As they had in several other regions, the Empire offered bounties on groups of rebel saboteurs in the Incorporation Islands when the resistance members became especially troublesome. When Raddus Venn learned that groups of heavily-armed CorSec officers were still resisting Imperial control in the Incorporation Islands, he helped an Imperial strike team draw out and kill several of them, hoping that his former comrades would see reason and surrender to Imperial rule. However, CorSec continued to resist\u2014an elite CorSec unit gained access to high-grade explosives and used them to bomb Incorporation Spaceport, destroying an entire squadron of Imperial transports and forcing the Empire to use the nearby Coronet Spaceport instead. An Imperial squad under Randun Ard were ordered by Junia Tavrak to eliminate the CorSec officers, but when the squad failed Tavrak was forced to enlist the help of other agents of the Empire in order to stop an attack on Coronet Spaceport."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A group of Drall\u2014a species native to the planet of the same name in the Corellian system\u2014under the leadership of a Drall named Aerowynn resisted initial attempts by Lieutenant Veet's squad to take their weapons factory, but further attacks by the Empire allowed the invaders to successfully take control of the explosive mines and munitions stored in the factory. A unit under Captain Helricks encountered a group of Wookiee factory workers within the magnogravitics plant in the Incorporation Islands. The Wookiees quickly decimated the squad, and Helricks was forced to retreat and seek help from other Imperial operatives.

Arriving on the planet, the military under General Aves quickly established a foothold at the Shipwright Auxiliary Spaceport in Coronet's Blastfield Shipyards and withstood all Imperial attempts to force them off the planet. Before long, the shipyards served as the main entry point for Republic forces, and their presence survived the numerous bombing runs made by the Imperials across the sector. The Empire established its own foothold in the area by seizing the Coronet Shipping trade hub, destroying the main ground approach to the facility's landing pads and maintaining constant aerial patrols to dissuade Republic assault shuttles. The Imperials also restricted Republic troop movements when they began use modified neutron emitters to blockade the Blastfield Shipyards. The emitters, which were targeted at the rocket trams and killed all organic lifeforms aboard, deadlocked Aves's forces and prevented him from moving any large detachments to most of Coronet other than Axial Park."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, fighting with the resistance primarily spilled over into the Labor Valley region, where Imperial forces under Major Tradik fought rebel guerrillas amidst burning factories and devastated structures. As the fighting increased across Corellia, arms dealers came to the planet in order to ply their trade to the occupation forces. One of these arms dealers, Jerris Rez, set up shop in the Labor Valley and began to supply military-grade ordnance and other weapons to Major Tradik. However, when groups of Wookiees, Drall, and Selonians began to attack his shipments, Rez hired several mercenaries to eliminate the aliens in exchange for some of his stock. Corellia StarDrive, a hyperdrive manufacturer, began to funnel credits and supplies to the resistance, but the Empire soon learned of this and had Captain Corgan Sturm's troops detonate explosives throughout the company's complex. The Republic forces aiding StarDrive were killed in the explosion, and the company's buildings were reduced to rubble."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "What few Republic forces that could get through to Axial Park soon managed to gain a foothold, and both the Empire and the Republic quickly erected shield generators and weapons emplacements to secure the region. Fighting also spilled over into the Government District, and a Republic command center was established in the Drall Library as the resistance and military besieged the Legislature building. The heavy fighting for Axial Park soon came to be called the \"Battle of Axial Park\" by the natives, as both the Republic and the Empire deployed significant portions of their forces and their military hardware to the fight for control of the region."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In response to continued resistance in the Labor Valley region, the Empire bombed several factories known to harbor Corellian rebels. However, many Corellians escaped the attack and were aided by Republic doctors, and the Sith Lord Velash ordered the execution of the survivors as a warning to the resistance. The Empire also began to offer a bounty on rebel Selonians in an effort to cull the aliens' numbers. Tradik's forces gained significant ground against the resistance when information from Councilor Sull allowed the Imperials to destroy several of the rebels' supply stores, striking a heavy blow against the Corellians. However, the resistance forces fled into the Selonian tunnel network underneath Coronet, forcing an Imperial strike team to follow and eliminate the Selonian den mother Murthil. As the resistance began to draw back from the region, Lieutenant Bregor ordered attacks on several of the rebels' remaining supply caches in order to deprive the Corellians of further resources in the fighting."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The forces under Generals Hesker and Adele Konya in Axial Park were forced to defend against Republic infiltrators when their turrets came under attack, and the Republic quickly deployed jump troopers, walkers, commandos, and artillery batteries in an effort to maintain their foothold in the area. Ambushes by Green Jedi soon became common in the park, and mercenary teams hired by the Empire to eliminate the ambushers failed repeatedly until the alien Grud enlisted the help of Imperial operatives. After drawing out the ambushers near the park's rocket tram tunnels, the Imperials overwhelmed the Green Jedi and ended the threat they posed. The Republic employed its elite rocket-jumpers as another method of ambushing Imperial forces, but the alien Thadd convinced Imperial squads to move the rocket-jumpers' landing beacons, drawing the Republic soldiers into ambushes themselves. When an Imperial weapons transport was shot down over the park, Lord Karvus led a munitions recovery team to retrieve the craft's newly designed high-yield explosives, but Republic forces ambushed the unit.

Despite the protests of zoo staff, Lieutenant Boonan's men exterminated the rare Corellian predators in order to end the threat they posed. When a Selonian warren in Axial Park began to threaten the Imperial occupation forces there, Lord Kanno's forces invaded their den and eradicated the natives. General Dane's position in Axial Park was threatened when the Republic began to deploy sapper droids against the shield generators protecting the Imperial Garrison there. Fortunately for the Empire, a combined Imperial and Sith offensive drove back the Republic troops from the generators, and the Imperial Garrison remained secure against the Republic. Hesker's forces eventually managed to push back the enemy into their command center, where an elite strike force stormed the compound and eliminated the Republic commander Jedi Master Corin Tok and his apprentices, killing many Republic wounded in the process.

He also utilized a bounty hunter, who had been publicly disgraced and criminalized by Supreme Chancellor Dorian Janarus and the Jedi Master Jun Seros, to advance the Imperial cause on the embattled Core World. Tormen intended to crush the Corellian resistance before the Republic could marshal a full military response, which would force the Republic to recognize a treaty declaring Corellia an official subject of the Empire, and therefore draw out the Chancellor so that the bounty hunter could eliminate him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Corellia, the hunter was employed by Tormen to capture several influential leaders of the rebellion so that the Empire could force them to publicly surrender. Working with Tormen's forces, the mercenary successfully captured Chairman Harlon Fane of the Corellian Corporate Council from his stronghold in the executive offices of the Corporate Council's tower in the Incorporation Islands. The bounty hunter also captured the Selonian Shrona Bel-Il, a raider who was aiding the resistance in breaking the Imperial lines, and delivered her to Tormen in the Sith Lord's headquarters in Axial Park. Tormen's third assignment was to capture Commissioner Carter from the CorSec Headquarters itself, and Prime Minister Falcone broadcast the trio's surrender from the Grand Assembly of the Legislature Building itself.

However, the hunter infiltrated Seros's headquarters and killed the experienced Jedi Master before he could complete his preparations. Not long after Janarus arrived in the Corellian system, he and Jedi Master Syo Bakarn learned that an Imperial fleet composed of over thirty troop transports, carrying thousands of reinforcements, was on its way to Corellia, led by a dreadnaught named the Javelin.

The Barsen'thor, meanwhile, traveled to Corellia to recover one of the members of the Javelin strike team, who had been ejected in an escape pod that had crashed in the Blastfield Shipyards.

Within the Enclave, the Sith forces killed Master Arfan Ramos and the other members of the Green Jedi Council in a battle in the Council's chamber, and Decimus's agents eliminated Darbin Sull since the man had outlived his usefulness. After taking the Green Jedi enclave, the Imperials established a garrison in the structure, but the Republic employed stealth troopers in an attempt to drive out the invaders. The Imperial tech specialist Shorn determined that the Republic was utilizing an incredibly advanced cloaking technology, but managed to modify a stealth field generator to disrupt other fields.

The Wrath foiled several assassins in the Incorporation Islands before making contact with Vowrawn in the elder Sith's base within one of the nearby towers. Allying with Vowrawn, the Wrath began to target Baras's subordinates on Corellia, starting with Colonel Senks, a spy planted in the Corellian resistance. After killing the spy in a resistance stronghold located in the Labor Valley, the Wrath exposed the traitorous Jedi Master Injaye to her comrades Rubatin, Tatham, and Joce before killing all four of the Jedi in their secret bunker.

With Gosse's information, the Republic began preparing for an assault on Coronet Shipping, but also freed her trapped den-mates from the Imperials at her request. The capture of Gosse's sept, or den-family, was part of the Empire's crackdown on the Selonians, whose efforts in aiding the resistance had greatly frustrated the Empire.

The Smuggler class, however, has no information on where it occurs in relation to the rest of the classes, so this article only assumes that it occurred sometime during the other classes' storylines."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Battle of Corellia was first hinted at in Corellia's entry in the HoloNet section of The Old Republic's official site, it did not appear until the release of The Art and Making of Star Wars: The Old Republic in November 2011. The game itself was released December 20, 2011, and the battle was a major part of the story on Corellia, which is a level 48-50 planet. Characters, missions, and locations in the battle appeared in the Star Wars: The Old Republic Explorer's Guide, which was released concurrently with the game, and the short story \"The Last Battle of Colonel Jace Malcom\" revealed the canonical outcome of the battle upon its release in Star Wars Insider 137 in October 2012. The novel The Old Republic: Annihilation, released in November 2012, also mentioned the battle, and the Star Wars: The Old Republic Encyclopedia released around the same time gave further information on the conflict."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Jedi Knight mission \"Firestorm,\" the three buildings can be visited in any order during the mission, so this article refrains from specifying the order, though Doctor Godera's comments to the player at the beginning of the mission erroneously indicate that there are only two buildings in which the Sith are working. According to the game's conversation files, the mission \"Firestorm\" originally had the player accompanied by Unaw Aharo, and the shuttle would be damaged by Republic artillery on the way to the first turbolaser. Aharo would repair the shuttle while the player took out the second turbolaser, though players could leave T7-O1 to repair the shuttle and take Aharo. However, this version of the mission was ultimately cut from the game. The Jedi Consular, Jedi Knight, and Trooper classes all see players commanding military forces, and most of their class missions on Corellia feature alignment choices as to how to commit those forces. As these three classes are Republic classes and are thus considered to follow the light side alignment choices, this article details those outcomes above. The dark side alignment choices, where one's forces are committed to goals such as attacking Imperial medical camps or working for bribes rather than aiding the resistance, result in the loss of the forces under the player's command. Some class missions deal with other choices, such as the Trooper class's decision whether to destroy the Lucky Lancer or to allow the resistance to fly it away. The Bounty Hunter class can choose to not kill Janarus and instead kill Darth Tormen, after which Janarus will resign due to corruption charges."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
