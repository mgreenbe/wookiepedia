Around 3 ABY, Jermit refused to do business with Jabba the Hutt in favor of doing business with a mysterious competitor of Jabba's. In response, Jabba sent his majordomo, Bib Fortuna, to try to persuade Jermit to reconsider. Jermit spoke with Fortuna during the Great Hunt of Malastare, but still refused. In response to his refusal, Fortuna allowed the Trandoshan bounty hunter Bossk to kill Jermit, as he had been hired to do by Jabba."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
