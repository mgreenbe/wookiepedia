After Pavol and Aleksin overpowered the stormtrooper sentries, the group took the yacht into space. However, this yacht turned out to be the Emperor Palpatine's pleasure craft Imperialis. Before Lando and Lobot could flee into hyperspace, the Emperor dispatched three Imperial Star Destroyers to recover the vessel. Pavol and Aleksin watched as the yacht evaded Imperial gravity mines.
