Around that time, Jabesq worked in the hangar of Naboo's Theed Royal Palace, wearing a helmet that bore the engineer's first name in the Futhork alphabet. Jabesq's surname was shared with Bernie Jabesq, another Theed Palace Space Vessel Engineering Corps member active around the same period."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character Jabesq was created for 1999's Star Wars: Episode I The Visual Dictionary, written by David West Reynolds. Although the caption accompanying Jabesq's helmet in the reference book states that \"Jabesq\" is the name written on the headgear, 2008's The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia established a transliteration table of the Futhork alphabet with which the writing on the helmet can be deciphered as \"Simon.\" The same source also established \"Simon\" as Jabesq's first name. The 2012 reference title Star Wars: The Phantom Menace: The Expanded Visual Dictionary reprinted the caption from Star Wars: Episode I The Visual Dictionary with a correction to reflect Jabesq's full name."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
