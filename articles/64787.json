The term Il Madri when translated into Basic was \"contemplation upon that stored away for meditation.\" The tenets of this religion required that the Ayrou lead ascetic lives marked by quiet action. The religion was utterly dropped, however, after the Ayrou made contact with the Galactic Republic. The Il Madri religion was replaced by the Society of Self-Actualization. One interesting aspect of the Il Madri religion was that its leaders hoarded vast amounts of treasure, but identified it as taboo, and only used it when deep meditation indicated the need for it. The accumulated wealth of treasure was believed to have been sealed away in a vault somewhere in the Moddell sector, and only the chalcedony idol known as Tessent could open the vault."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
