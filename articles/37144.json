He attended the Skystrike Academy with Wedge Antilles and Rake Gahree. He and Antilles defected to the rebellion after making contact with Sabine Wren. After the Battle of Yavin, Luke Skywalker invited Klivian to join Rogue Squadron.

He trained others in asteroid running and no-instrument navigation. One day Klivian met fellow pilot Wedge Antilles while playing several hands of Sabacc at their baracks. He also met Rake Gahree. However, Klivian, along with many of his peers, eventually wanted to contact the growing rebellion against the Empire and use his skills to fight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Antilles and Gahree were also discontent with the direction they felt the Empire was taking and made plans to defect to the rebellion. This information eventually made its way to one of the many Fulcrum agents, who became the link Klivian needed. Fulcrum passed the information to the Phoenix Cell."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The information also caught the attention of the Imperial Security Bureau, which dispatched Lothal sector's Governor Arihnda Pryce as well as agent Kallus to investigate the claims.

Sabine arranged for her rebel comrades Ezra Bridger and Kanan Jarrus to rendezvous their CR90 corvette near the planet. At Sabine's signal, Hobbie and his comrades flew towards the rebel corvette. However, Pryce deactivated the TIEs' solar collector panels, leaving them derelict in space. Pryce also ordered Captain Vult Skerris to shoot one of the TIE pods as a warning; claiming the life of Rake. Hobbie, Sabine and Wedge were soon arrested by Imperial forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following their capture, Wedge and Hobbie were thrown into a holding cell by Kallus. Inside the two debated their escape plans with Wedge suggesting they surprise the guards. A demoralized Hobbie was dubious of their chances of success due to the lack of an escape plan. Fortunately for them, they were rescued by Sabine, who had managed to knock out Governor Pryce. The defectors and Sabine then fled down a corridor only to run into Agent Kallus. However, the ISB agent had a change of heart due to his previous encounter with Sabine's rebel cell and allowed them to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Heading to Hangar 24, Hobbie and his friends fled on a TIE bomber.

They suddenly heard Hera Syndulla call for them, and in the shock to get ready, the two ran straight into each other. In their absence after they left, Chopper Base was infiltrated by the E-XD-series infiltrator droid EXD-9, who was searching the Outer Rim Territories for rebel bases. The Lasat Garazeb Orrelios, the inventory droid AP-5, and the astromech droid Chopper managed to capture and reprogram the droid as an improvised rigged bomb which destroyed an Imperial Star Destroyer."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Alliance to Restore the Republic"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Battle of Atollon"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, all of the individual rebel cells grouped together to reorganize into the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Just as Phoenix Squadron had been preparing to make an attack on the Imperial factory on Lothal, the Chiss Grand Admiral Thrawn managed to discover the location of Chopper Base, and subsequently launched an all-out attack in an attempt to finally thwart out their rebel actives, which had become a legitimate threat to the Empire. During the ground assault, Hobbie, Wedge and two other rebel pilots launched their A-wing starfighters in order to counter the AT-AT walkers that had been stationed on the planet's surface. With Wedge signalling Hobbie to follow him, the duo attempted to attack the walkers; however, Thrawn quickly took note of their excursion, and dispatched TIE fighters to repel them. The A-wings and the TIE-fighters consequently engaged in a dogfight. Towards the latter part of the battle, the two managed to escape, along with the remnants of Phoenix Squadron and General Jan Dodonna's Massassi Group to Yavin 4."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Rand Ecliptic mutiny"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around this time, Klivian went undercover and attended the Prefsbelt Fleet Camp with Biggs Darklighter.

After the rebel presence on the planet was discovered by Darth Vader's Death Squadron, Hobbie and other starfighter pilots attended a briefing by Princess Leia Organa prior to the impending Battle of Hoth. Klivian and Rogue Squadron would fly T-47 snowspeeders, with the squadron's X-wing starfighters kept in reserve to escape Hoth, to delay the landing Imperial ground forces while the rest of the station evacuated. Once this task was completed, the pilots would escort each individual transport away from the base, past the Imperial blockade. Skeptical that two fighters would be able to fight their way past an Imperial Star Destroyer, Organa nevertheless assured him that the base's v-150 ion cannon would provide enough cover for the escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the battle against the Empire's AT-AT walkers, Hobbie served as Skywalker's wingman, and he remained in the air for longer than the majority of rebel pilots. In addition to a high casualty rate, however, the rebels also lost their base's deflector shield generator to General Maximilian Veers's walker, Blizzard One. After a hit crippled his snowspeeder, Hobbie did not eject from his ship and instead crashed it into the head of Blizzard One. With the walker now decapitated, Hobbie's maneuver had saved numerous rebels from its cannons and blunted the Imperial advance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Klivian was a human male who stood 1.75 meters tall.

The author Daniel Wallace, in an interview with Eleven Thirty-Eight, clarified that the Lucasfilm Story Group pointed him to the planned scene, so he could incorporate it in the book.
