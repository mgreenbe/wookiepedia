After the bounty hunter Fennec Shand tracked down her target, the child clone Omega, in the marketplace and persuaded the girl to come with her by posing as a helpful stranger, Shand learned Omega was hungry. Deliberately bumping into the vendor, who was carrying a basket of her wares, Shand knocked some of the fruit to the ground while making it look like an accident. She then stole two pieces by concealing them in her helmet as she and Omega helped gather the fallen fruit and return it to the vendor, who thanked them for their kindness."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
