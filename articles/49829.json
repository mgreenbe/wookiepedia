The height to which a user could jump varied depending on skill level and physique; however, most Jedi Masters could easily jump several times their own height. Jedi Knight Jaden Korr was known to have been able to jump up to eight times higher than a normal jump and a Jedi during the Battle of Galidraan was able to jump high enough to reach the Mandalorian Myles who was flying high in the air using a Jetpack and cut him in half. A skilled user could leap tremendous distances when combining this technique with that of the muscle-enhancing Force speed and perform impossible acrobatic stunts with Inertia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It can be considered a hybrid ability also placing it in the Alter area as Telekinesis is used to conduct abnormal jumps. One example is when Obi-Wan Kenobi was hanging with his hands just before leaping to slice Darth Maul in half. When jumping down Telekinesis is also coupled when slowing the landing of the jumps in order to make sure the user isn't hurt during the fall. Another example is when Mace Windu jumps off the balcony on Geonosis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In combat, a well-timed Force Jump enabled the user to quickly cross the distance to engage an enemy; this was most widely employed during lightsaber battles. It was also common for Jedi to use this technique to evade attacks in lightsaber combat, many would use and practice sai acrobatics which relied on the Force for the jump's power, height, and speed. This ability was essential for practitioners of the acrobatic fourth form of lightsaber combat, such as Yoda."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the time of the Dark Nest Crisis, Jedi trainees of the New Jedi Order at the academy on Ossus practiced their Force Leaps from a young age by jumping over a three-meter cross ray.
