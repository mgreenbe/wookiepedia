Various Hutt criminals attempted to take control of Skar'kla territory while Ur'etu was in control; eventually, one of them hired a bounty hunter to impersonate a Jedi and harass Skar'kla operations and then kill Ur'etu. To defend himself from what he believed was a Jedi, Ur'etu hired the Duros bounty hunter Cad Bane to kill the assassin. Bane however allowed the bounty hunter to kill Ur'etu before defeating him in turn and making a deal to collect the crime lord's bounty himself and be taught how to make the imposter's equipment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Skar'kla Consortium first appeared in the short story Reputation which was written by Ari Marmell and published in Star Wars Insider 136 in 2012."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
