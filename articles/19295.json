Saw Gerrera used it to torture Bodhi Rook on Jedha to ascertain the truth behind his claim of being in contact with Galen Erso. Afterwards, Rook was for a time left a gibbering wreck, unable to speak a coherent thought and acting very panicky. Despite this, Rook showed some resilience, as he recovered upon hearing himself referred to as \"the pilot,\" and was able to recover enough of his senses to escape from Jedha when Jedha City was targeted by the superlaser of the Galactic Empire's Death Star superweapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bor Gullet first appeared in the 2016 film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The creature was illustrated by Ivan Manzella and designed by Neal Scanlan, and it was sculpted at full size, which had never been attempted before. Two and a half tons of silicone were used in the process, and Bor Gullet was ultimately realized as a life-size, 10 by 6 by 6 foot puppet operated by a crew of fifteen puppeteers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
