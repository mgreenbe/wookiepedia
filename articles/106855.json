Riders rode up an incline of forty-five degrees to the apex topped by a Gate Fence. Past the peak, riders had to guide their swoops over a chasm of thirty meters, dropping ten to fifteen meters in height to land on the opposite side. The pit in the middle of the Pop'N'Drop was usually filled with spikes and dropped one hundred meters. A variation of the Pop'N'Drop was the Suicide Peak."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
