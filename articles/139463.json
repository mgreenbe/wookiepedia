Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, a female Zabrak Rebel Second Lieutenant, named Aaph Koden, became involved in a series of operations to save Reede from the Galactic Empire. With the help of a Rebel agent, Reede was rescued from the Empire and brought to Anchorhead to begin her Jedi training."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime following 0 BBY, a female Zabrak Second Lieutenant named Aaph Koden of the Rebel Alliance, learned that entertainer Talia Reede might be a Force-sensitive. Knowing the dangers of being a Force-sensitive in an Imperial-controlled galaxy, Koden hoped to deliver a warning message to Reede."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fortunately, Koden encountered a spacer who happened to be a loyal member of the Rebellion. Koden asked the Rebel agent to deliver the warning to Reede, with the hope that she would recognize the danger, and contact the Alliance for help. The Rebel agent agreed, and set off to find Talia Reede. When Reede received the message, she expressed surprise at being a Force-sensitive. However, she told the Rebel that she would check it out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However the situation grew worse. The Empire had learned of Talia Reede's Force-sensitivity, and were on their way to kill her. Aaph Koden, unable to entrust anyone else with the mission, asked the same Rebel agent to save Reede. When the Rebel asked why Reede could not simply use the Force to save herself, Koden replied that Reede was not adequately trained. Ultimately, the Rebel agreed to save Reede from an Imperial stormtrooper commander and two other stormtroopers. Fortunately for Reede and the Rebel agent, the stormtroopers proved no match. Koden eventually asked the Rebel to help Reede again, this time by escorting her safely to Anchorhead for Jedi training. When the Rebel asked why Reede had not started training sooner, Koden answered that Reede was still skeptical she was a Force-sensitive. Koden believed that she simply needed to be convinced. Once again, the Rebel agent agreed to help, and successfully found Reede and brought her back safely to town. Though she still found the whole idea of Jedi training farfetched, she agreed to give it a try. From then on, Talia Reede would begin her training under the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Reede had tan colored skin, brown eyebrows, and yellow eyes. She was also an entertainer. Before being contacted by the Rebel agent, Reede was totally oblivious to the fact that she was Force-sensitive. Before the Rebel approached her, she noticed a rock fly past her, but dismissed this as a mirage, rather than an unintentional use of the Force. Even after nearly being hunted down by stormtroopers, Reede commented to the Rebel agent that the whole idea of Jedi training still seemed farfetched to her. Indeed, Reede was quite unaware of her abilities, but Aaph Koden felt she simply needed to be convinced. Indeed, Koden was confident that Reede had the markings of a future Jedi Knight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because Reede had never been formally trained in the Force, she could not use any powers to her advantage. However, she did once notice a rock fly past her. She dismissed this as a mirage, rather than an unintentional use of telekinesis. Before being brought to Anchorhead to begin her Jedi training, Reede was for the most part helpless, depending on the Rebel agent to escort her safely to Koden.
