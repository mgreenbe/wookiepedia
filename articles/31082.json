The treats were similar to cream-stuffed pastries but were filled with live crabs. In 0 ABY, crab-stuffed creampuffs were served at the Life Day celebration of the Mon Calamari Bobringi Mafusa on the luxury star-cruiser Star of Empire, but when the ship was evacuated because of engine troubles, the leftover creampuffs were abandoned. After the evacuation of the cruiser, a Human named Zak Arranda found a platter of the creampuffs and eagerly bit into one of the desserts. To his dismay, his mouth was filled with tiny, live crabs, so he spit the creampuff out while shaking the crustaceans off himself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Crab-stuffed creampuffs appeared in the tenth installment of John Whitman's Star Wars: Galaxy of Fear young reader series, The Doomsday Ship, published in 1998."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
