Meadlin's trees grew in groups and and would twist around each other and merge as they got bigger, forming complicated networks that were several kilometers in length. These outcroppings also produced a dim blue light, which was emitted from the trees' spherical spore buds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The largest networks of Mealin's trees grew inside Nyriaan's caverns and canyons.
