Following that engagement, which saw the Hammers reduced to roughly a third of its former size, the unit served at a battalion level for more than two years, nonetheless experiencing a rapid succession of victories against the Alliance forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the Hammers' commanding officer, Colonel Zel Johans, convinced the Imperial Command of the practical value of restoring his unit to regimental strength, and to that end, the Hammers were recalled to Brintooin for reorganization and retraining.
