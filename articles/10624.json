It consisted of four separate sections which came together as one to create the entire sculpture, which resembled the town's insignia. This was meant to symbolize how each citizen of Aurilia was just one piece in a greater whole. A complete set of sculpture pieces were awarded to a Force-sensitive spacer by Whip, Quharek, Captain Sarguillo, and the township's chief engineer. They were a reward to the spacer for being instrumental in the defeat of Aurilia's greatest enemy, the Zabrak Dark Jedi Mellichae, sometime after the Battle of Yavin during the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Aurilian sculpture appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. Its four pieces were originally rewards from several different quests in the original iteration of the village of Aurilia. When Aurilia was blocked off with the release of the New Game Enhancements in November 2005, the sculpture pieces became no longer obtainable, and thus very valuable. The sculpture pieces were reintroduced in the \"rare loot system\" on October 7, 2010. The rare loot system allowed players to loot increasingly rare items from any enemy in the game. Despite the game's treatment of the statue as a unique item, multiple players characters could own it simultaneously."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
