As Jabba was not interested in Skywalker's proposal, Skywalker used the Force to snatch Nizuc Bek's blaster from his holster, prompting Jubnuk to try and wrestle it out of Luke's hand to protect Jabba. The Hutt, however, opened the trapdoor of the room in which they were and Skywalker fell into the pit of Pateesa, the Hutt's pet rancor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As being near to Skywalker when the trapdoor was opened, Jubnuk fell into Pateesa's pit despite his attempts to hold onto Jabba's moving throne. The Jedi Knight and the Gamorrean then slipped down the slide which led to the pit. After getting up, both saw the door open revealing Pateesa, who had previously eaten Jabba's dancer Oola. Jubnuk, squealing in terror, attempted to climb back up the trapdoor's steep slide to no avail. As his fellow Gamorrean guards laughed at his misfortune, the rancor grabbed Jubnuk and ate him. Skywalker, on the other hand, was able to kill the beast and avoid a similar fate, greatly angering Jabba."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of Jubnuk's hands was stuck in between Pateesa's teeth when Malakili and Giran mourned the rancor's death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jubnuk was portrayed by puppeteer Simon Williamson in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, the final installment of the Star Wars original trilogy.

The book particularly showed Jubnuk surviving his encounter with the rancor, escaping from him after the beast's stomach was cut. Holocron continuity database keeper Leland Chee stated that he didn't know about this until he was notified by a Wookieepedia user.
