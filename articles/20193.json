Because of this, the Jedi Council were eager to investigate when a distress signal was received from the planet.

Kenobi and Gallia encountered one of Ravna's creatures, who infected the clone trooper Peel. The Jedi investigated the Citadel, discovering that Count Dooku was working with Lord Ravna, planning to infect the Republic army with Ravna's creatures and cause it to collapse. As Dooku confronted the Jedi Masters, he was infected by Ravna, but managed to fight back with help from Kenobi.
