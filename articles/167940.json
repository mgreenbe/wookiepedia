Following the evacuation of the spaceport, he met C-3PO and his counterpart, R2-D2. Quickly he gained their support and that of dozens of leftover and broken droids. Together they rerouted a possible explosion on the station and foiled Olag Greck's plan to steal a load of ash ore. They then pursued Greck across space to Nar Shaddaa, where Unit Zed was wounded by Greck's bodyguard, Xob, before he was destroyed by Jace Forno."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
