Within the Order, he became a Jedi Guardian, a combat-orientated Jedi specialization. However, at some stage he fell to the dark side of the Force and became a Dark Jedi. He abandoned the Jedi Order and joined the Believers, a Sith-worshipping cult that was active in the Cularin system. He also acquired a stolen lightsaber weapon which had been built by the Jedi Master Mace Windu."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 31 BBY, a team of Jedi researchers discovered the Pulas, an ancient and powerful Sith artifact in the Sith fortress on the planet Almas. To prevent the Pulas from falling into the hands of the Believers, the Jedi shipped the artifact away from Almas, for safekeeping at the Jedi Temple, the headquarters of the Jedi Order, on the planet Coruscant. The Believers schemed to steal the Pulas when it arrived on Coruscant and as part of the plot, Fahr, the Human scoundrel Malyas and a band of Believer thugs gathered at a secret base deep in the Coruscant undercity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the assistance of Es'Loma, a Tarasin Force witch, a group of Believers seized a Mandalorian iron box containing what they believed to be the Pulas from a Coruscant landing platform. In truth the box was a decoy set by the Jedi to deceive the Believers and it instead contained a fragment of the dark-side imbued city Conkesta. The Believers transported the box to their secret undercity base; it was placed on an altar and Fahr attempted to open it using his lightsaber and a set of tools."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A short time later, a group of Jedi-allied agents arrived at the Believer facility in pursuit of the stolen box.

Though outspoken in his support of the Believers, Fahr was not fully corrupted by their ideology.

When in a difficult situation, Fahr would refuse to surrender even if at cost of his life. To that end, during the raid on the Believer Coruscant undercity base by the Jedi-allied agents Fahr's sole aim was to escape with the stolen Mandalorian iron box at whatever cost."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fahr was proficient in the use of the Force to sense things, grip and push objects, to drain energy and to heal and strengthen himself.

If the player characters apprehend a Believer guard posted to watch the entrance to their base, their arrival takes Fahr and the other cultist by surprise. Alternatively, the guard can forewarn Fahr of the coming of the Jedi-allied agents, in which case Fahr and the other cultists gather in the central chamber of the base to await the player characters' arrival. It is possible for the players to incapacitate or kill Fahr and for them to take his lightsaber from him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Coruscani Dawn it is also possible for the Jedi Knight Devan For'deschel to join the player characters in their fight against Fahr. If For'deschel duels with Fahr and comes close to overcoming him, Fahr gets a lucky strike against her at the last moment and then flees. If the player characters are defeated and immobilized by the Believers, Fahr ensures that they receive medical treatment to steady their condition and leaves some medpacs next to them.
