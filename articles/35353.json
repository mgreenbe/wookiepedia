Prior to the two meeting, Glen thought he would remain a bachelor and a simple farmer. She died prior to the rebellion on Akiva in 4 ABY. Her son Dav joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic, while Webb attended the Imperial Academy and remained loyal to the Galactic Empire. During a family dinner at the Taffral home some time after the mother's death, Glen entreated the two brothers to stop quarreling over their differing loyalties. He fondly brought up the memory of their mother and mourned her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mother of Dav and Webb Taffral was first mentioned in Aftermath, a 2015 novel written by Chuck Wendig as the first installment in Star Wars: The Aftermath Trilogy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
