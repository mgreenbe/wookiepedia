The battle began when forces from an Imperial splinter group ambushed an X-wing squadron from the New Republic cruiser, Nova while it was conducting a series of training maneuvers. The entire squadron was lost in the ensuing dogfight, including two of the cruiser's best pilots. The Imperial faction, known as the Kaarenth Dissension, was allied with the Dark Jedi Durrei, although it was unknown if he participated in the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
