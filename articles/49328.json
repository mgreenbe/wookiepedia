The Alliance to Restore the Republic used a simulator which resembled the interior of an X-wing cockpit removed from its frame and connected to a large monitor. The highest score on this simulator was held by pilot Wedge Antilles, although his record was trumped by new recruit Luke Skywalker shortly before the Battle of Yavin. The simulator was designed to present Rebel pilots with a no-win scenario. It immediate plunged the pilot into a space battle with simulated Imperial forces, steadily increasing the number until the battle became overwhelming and even the most skilled pilot could no longer survive under the onslaught."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Age of the Empire, the Jelucan aristocrat Thane Kyrell's family owned an old flight simulator. He invited his new-found friend Ciena Ree to practice with him. The two later joined the Imperial Navy.
