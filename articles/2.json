It depicts the technical schematics of the All Terrain Armored Transport walker. The 3-D model for the AT-AT itself required 25 set pieces for creation. The image was 36\"\u00a0\u00d7\u00a017\", and 43\"\u00a0\u00d7\u00a024\" when framed. The model was colored in gold aluminum that was designed by a group of architects in Seattle that were affiliated with the United States Navy. It was mounted in 2\" polished stainless steel standoffs on a supporting plate in a shadow box frame. Like all SpecPlates, it came with a Certificate of Authenticity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
