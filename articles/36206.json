The Republic agent subsequently pursued the Shroud to his base on Nar Shaddaa and killed him, before deactivating the beacon, sending the dreadnaught flying into Coruscant Prime. Additionally, the agent found encrypted data in the Shroud's databanks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unfortunately, when the agent returned to Riss's office, a Shroud replicator droid had placed a collar on the back of Riss's neck which would go off if anyone approached her. The droid then changed into the image of the Shroud, who revealed that he had a decoy die in his place. But his decoy had stolen information he was not supposed to and demanded that the agent wipe it from Riss's console in exchange for Riss's life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The agent then chose to save Riss's life, and compiled with the Shroud's demands. Upholding his end of the bargain, the Shroud released Riss, bid the agent farewell, and detonated the replicator droid. Riss was initially unhappy that the Shroud was allowed to escape, but then convinced herself that the agent's actions were overall positive, as the attack on Coruscant had been thwarted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Deena Riss appeared in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel a 2013 expansion to the 2011 massively-multiplayer online roleplaying video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.
