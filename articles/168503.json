The Death Watch, led by Pre Vizsla and Sith Lords Darth Maul and Savage Opress met Moj at the front of the facility. Maul requested an audience with his leader, Xomit Grunseit. Moj led them there where they met with Grunseit. Maul attempted to sway the Falleen to his side, but Grunseit refused. As a result of this, Opress killed him, along with all the other members of Black Sun in the room. Moj, meanwhile, decided to ally with Maul."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Now allied with Maul's Shadow Collective, Moj would travel with Maul and Opress as they searched for people to rally. A short time later, he was present for a briefing session where holographic images of the city were analyzed, in order for them to attack the city in the right places. In the takeover of the New Mandalorian capital city of Sundari, Moj's job was to cause disruption throughout the city as per the plan devised by Maul and Pre Vizsla. Moj first attacked the Sundari shipping docks, where the gangsters first entered Sundari, and then moved on to wreak havoc in Peace Park. Moj's team was ultimately \"stopped\" by Death Watch forces led by Bo-Katan Kryze, and he was presented to the people of Sundari as a prisoner."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
