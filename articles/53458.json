This allowed them to glide among the native trees of their homeworld. These membranes were attached to specialized muscles that allowed them to adjust the position of the flaps. This made them very agile in flight. Gazaran had sharp claws that made them proficient climbers. They were herbivores and subsisted on fruits, nuts and berries|. The species gave birth to live infants after a 133-day gestation that had to be nursed when young."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Making their homes in the Veron rain forests, they had minimal technology by the time of the Galactic Empire's rise to power.
