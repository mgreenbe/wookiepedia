The armor could bring its wearer to life from near-death conditions. After studying the armor, the Empire gave it to the White Maw Captain Valon, instructing him to carry out strikes against the Galactic Republic. However, Valon became too independent and planned to use the armor to become the leader of the entire White Maw organization. The Captain was stopped by the Barsen'thor of the Jedi Order, who broke the armor by repeatedly inflicting serious injury to Valon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
