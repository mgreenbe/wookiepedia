The son of Senator Hamato Xiono, Kazuda served with the Starfighter Corps of the New Republic Defense Fleet during the Cold War, at which point the Resistance recruited him to spy on the First Order. As a result, he was sent to the Colossus\u2014an independent refueling station located on the Outer Rim planet Castilon\u2014where Commander Poe Dameron instructed him to gather information pertaining to the local population's sympathies and determine if their allegiance was to the Republic or the First Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xiono upheld an occupation in Jarek Yeager's repair station as a cover, though he struggled to hold his cover as a spy. Befriending Neeku Vozo and Tamara Ryvora while on the station, Xiono struggled to uphold his role as a spy, often finding himself at odds with both the First Order and the station's own citizens. When tensions came to a head with the destruction of his home planet, Xiono played a vital role in liberating the station from its First Order occupation, though doing so came at the cost of Ryvora's allegiance. After freeing the Colossus and helping it escape Castilon, Xiono was anointed a member of Ace Squadron, and helped to defend the Colossus from First Order forces during the hunt for the station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xiono helped search for a suitable new home for the Colossus as the station traveled through space, visiting multiple different planets. Throughout the journey, Xiono made rendezvouses with other Resistance cells, and found himself caught in multiple close calls with the pursuing First Order. In numerous encounters, Xiono found himself directly fighting Ryvora herself, who had joined the First Order. Though briefly intending to leave the Colossus to fully join the Resistance after he had been offered a place among their ranks, Xiono changed his mind, choosing to instead lead a final stand against the First Order forces led by Commander Pyre and Agent Tierny when the Colossus came under attack. Xiono, with help from Yeager, rescued Ryvora from the First Order upon her decision to defect. Xiono's actions and selflessness helped to inspire the citizens of the Colossus to fight back alongside Captain Imanuel Doza and Ryvora, leading to their victory against their attackers. Following the Colossus' liberation, Xiono later piloted the Fireball at the Battle of Exegol as part of the citizens' fleet amassed by Lando Calrissian, the events of which ultimately resulted in the demise of the resurrected Darth Sidious and a galactic uprising against the First Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Born on the Core World Hosnian Prime in 14 ABY, Kazuda \"Kaz\" Xiono was the son of his mother and Senator Hamato Xiono, a wealthy politician who served in the New Republic Senate during the era when the galaxy was governed by the New Republic, years after the Galactic Civil War.

They were engaged by Major Elrik Vonreg, who sought to prevent the squadron from completing their mission. Xiono briefly argued with his droid, R2-C4, remaining adamant that Poe Dameron would arrive. After protests from his wingmates regarding the intel's importance, Xiono pointed out that it must have been important if they were being attacked over it. Unable to outmaneuver the First Order pilot, Xiono ordered his wingmates, Mia Gabon and Hugh Sion, to abandon the mission while he remained behind to await the arrival of their Resistance contact, Commander Poe Dameron. After his wingmates' escape, Xiono's X-wing was shot and damaged in one of its engines, though he remained ecstatic due to Gabon and Sion's escape. The euphoria proved to be short-lived as both Xiono and his droid lamented that they were too young to die, though Dameron suddenly appeared, rescuing Xiono.

Dameron met him onboard soon after, and they congratulated one another on their victory and teamwork. Dameron briefly inquired as to whether or not Xiono was interested in joining the Resistance, to which Xiono affirmed that he had, but ultimately decided against due to his father's wishes for him. Dameron was soon after called to deliver the intel to General Leia Organa, prompting Xiono to ask Dameron to tell Organa that he believed her to be the bravest person in the whole galaxy.

Xiono eventually heard General Organa behind a door, which promptly opened, causing Xiono to stumble into the room where Dameron was speaking to her via hologram. Dameron quickly ushered Xiono out of the room, asking if the young pilot was spying on him. After Xiono denied this claim, Dameron confided in him that the intel Xiono had delivered confirmed the Resistance's suspicions that the First Order was preparing for a full-scale attack on the New Republic.

Dameron simply responded that Xiono would \"be both.\" The duo soon began their approach to the Colossus, a supertanker fuel depot stationed on Castilon. Xiono's excitement returned as he recalled stories he heard about the Colossus.

Dameron briefly introduced Xiono to Neeku, in turn, before having him follow to Aunt Z's Tavern. As Xiono and Dameron carried about their business, however, Neeku began to spread word about Xiono's self-proclaimed skill as a pilot, leading nearly the entire station to learn about Xiono's false reputation. As a result, Aunt Z addressed Xiono accordingly, albeit sarcastically, upon meeting him. The group informed Aunt Z they were searching for Yeager, who was already sitting in the tavern. Dameron introduced Xiono to Yeager, who, like Aunt Z, expressed awareness of who he was due to the rumors, as well as an initial refusal to help Poe and Xiono carry out the mission.

After an argument between Grool and Grevel over who Xiono owed, a bar fight was started in the tavern, which Yeager promptly ended after he and Dameron returned. During the following conversation, Xiono reaffirmed that Vozo had taken Xiono's word too easily, blaming him for the trouble that had occurred. Xiono's  words had hurt Vozo, who he proceeded to try and apologize to, stating that it was technically in the realm of possibility that he was the best pilot on the Colossus, as he had yet to race anyone.

Afterward, Dameron informed Xiono that he would be leaving, though he first informed him that the race could be Xiono's best chance to establish good relations with the citizens of the platform. As he left, Dameron ordered BB-8 to remain on the Colossus and keep an eye on Xiono. After Dameron's departure, Xiono expressed frustration toward Vozo oncemore, though the Nikto stated that he believed in Kaz, and that Xiono could change the lives of the platform's citizens for the better.

Later, in Aunt Z's Tavern, Xiono was distraught over his lack of a ship with which to participate; in response, Yeager stated he would loan Xiono the Fireball, a racer he and his crew, Team Fireball, had been working on. The group went to Yeager's repair shop, where Xiono reacted in disbelief to the Fireball's poor condition. At this point Xiono was introduced to Tamara Ryvora, who claimed to Xiono that he had never flown a better ship than the Fireball. Yeager, in turn, introduced Xiono to Ryvora as their newest employee. However, the introduction between Xiono and Ryvora was stale, with Ryvora leaving in frustration upon learning Xiono would be lent the Fireball. Afterwards, Xiono accidentally broke a part off of the Fireball, prompting Yeager to call his old astromech droid, Bucket, who took the part from Xiono and knocked him out with it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Xiono asked Yeager what supplies would be necessary to repair the Fireball.

Xiono expressed to Yeager that he may still have a slim chance, prompting Yeager to chastise him, telling that he only needed to survive the race, not necessarily win it.

After Vozo pleaded with Orka briefly, the Chadra-Fan agreed to supply Xiono with second-hand parts if he and Vozo grabbed a gorg for Flix and Orka's lunch. Xiono and Vozo went to the Colossus marketplace, where they discovered the gorg salesman was in fact Bolza Grool, the Klatooinian Xiono had accidentally hit with a dart earlier. After being threatened, Xiono offered Grool a deal, in which he would market Grool's gorg shop on the Fireball during the race in exchange for a gorg. Grool accepted the offer, and Xiono purchased a gorg that had just bitten his fingers. After the exchange, Xiono and Neeku returned to the Office of Acquisitions, only to discover Flix and Orka had already eaten. Nonetheless, they accepted the gorg and gave Xiono the parts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xiono and Vozo returned to the repair shop, only for Ryvora and Yeager to complain about the condition of the parts.

As he prepared for launch, however, the Fireball malfunctioned. As Torra took off in the Blue Ace with a head start, the Fireball began to plummet toward the ocean below. Xiono narrowly escaped the crash, managing to activate his racer just before impact. He eventually began to catch up to Torra, growing cockier as his success lasted longer. Xiono nearly won, but eventually began to push the engines of the Fireball too much, despite Yeager's warnings, resulting in the Fireball malfunctioning. This caused Xiono to crash into the final sky ring, before finally impacting the ocean's surface, knocking himself out in the crash."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xiono eventually woke up in Yeager's shop, surrounded by Yeager, Vozo, Ryvora, and Torra.

Yeager agreed to allow Xiono to stay with him and work as a mechanic in Team Fireball, though in exchange Xiono was to leave Yeager out of his dealings with the Resistance.

Neeku Vozo then approached Xiono to inform him of a new job, but then noticed Xiono's trophy, complimenting it before going into a tirade regarding his old pet Lucky, which disgusted Xiono. After the brief conversation with Vozo, Yeager called Xiono over to the worksite, informing him that he would be performing his first job as a mechanic as Ryvora and Vozo supervised. Xiono then lamented his inexperience in repairing ships, asserting that he was better suited for work as a pilot.

Xiono briefly panicked after accidentally causing his friend harm, again accidentally handing him the wrong tool, though Vozo noticed this time and grabbed the correct one. Xiono then pushed multiple buttons in a haphazardly attempt to help fix the ship, only resulting in an ear-piercingly loud feedback loop to occur. Xiono quickly disabled it, and timidly claimed that his \"test\" of the feedback system was a success. Ryvora then confronted Xiono, asking him if he had ever worked on a ship before.

However, Xiono decided to use this chance to also begin his attempts at \"spying.\" Xiono's attempts to do so were poor, with him often hiding in plain sight, which in turn caused attention to be attracted to him by the Ithorian Egdir, though he quickly departed. He then stumbled across a pair of squabbling Snivvians, Nod and Narb, who caught Xiono and confronted him for listening in. Grevel then arrived, exclaiming that Xiono still had yet to pay his debt to him. Xiono escaped in a panic, being chased by the Snivvians, though he was eventually caught after tripping over a basket of food Grevel had knocked over. While being held by Grevel, Xiono dropped his trophy, which Grevel realized was made of pure aurodium.

Xiono was pulled aside by Ryvora immediately after, who chastized him for being \"late.\" Ryvora then dragged Xiono back to the repair shop by the ear. Upon his return, Yeager had Xiono immediately start installing the compressor, during which Xiono overheard Nark speaking to the captain of the Warbird gang, Kragan Gorr. While eavesdropping, Xiono heard Nark tell Kragan that they were \"all clear for a triple dark.\" Xiono then finished his work, hopping out of the shuttle and informing Nark, only to startle the Neimoidian and cause him to drop his comlink.

When Xiono inquired as to the meaning of \"triple dark\", Glem explained that they were a type of storm with low visibility, often used as a cover to launch attacks by pirates. Initially expressing empathy to Nark and Kragan Gorr, hoping they had escaped the storm alright, Xiono soon learned that Gorr was in fact an infamous pirate on Castilon, and that Hallion Nark was in fact a spy for the Warbird gang. As Xiono attempted to leave and warn the others, he was stopped by Grevel, who was now threatening him at gunpoint for his trophy.

The pirates quickly swooped around, dumping Xiono and Grevel back onto the platform. Xiono then made a break for the blast doors once more, as they had begun to close again. Xiono panicked in an attempt to find a way to hold the door for Grevel, before quickly thinking to use his trophy's sturdiness to hold it open, saving Grevel.

After realizing the comlink was patched into pirate communications, Xiono quickly caused the high-pitched feedback loop he had created earlier, and broadcasted it through the Warbird gang's communications.

Xiono was surprised to learn that Rucklin's crew was given days off, as Yeager himself rarely provided Xiono with such a luxury. Gaava and Wiles then explained to Xiono that if Yeager wanted to, he could have been one of the top racers on the platform. Rucklin then asked Xiono if he had ever seen Yeager's racer, which Xiono had initially assumed he meant the Fireball; Rucklin instead reaffirmed that he meant Yeager's \"real\" racer.
