As part of this military presence, the New Republic also had some guards stationed on the moon guarding the Praxeum hangar. In 24 ABY, Anja Gallandro stole a freighter, the Lightning Rod, and fled the moon. The fleet was not prepared to intercept someone leaving the moon, and so were unable to prevent her unauthorized departure."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
