Encountering the young Tusken Raider Reirin in the city of Mos Eisley, they hired her to steal a crystal from a tribe of Jawas. The trader told Reirin that the crystal would be one of many colors, including blue, green or purple, and that the Jawas would know what it was. They wore a cloak and hood to conceal their identity. In exchange for the crystal, they offered Reirin passage off Tatooine.
