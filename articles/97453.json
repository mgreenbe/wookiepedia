Idyth used the amulet to contain his darker emotions, allowing himself to appear as a paragon of the Jedi Order. However, the amulet's darkness influenced Idyth, who stalked the Coruscant Underworld at night, causing terror. Idyth was eventually killed, and the amulet was given to his Padawan, Sol Mogra, who was similarly affected by the amulet. After discovering the truth, Mogra was ashamed, and allowed the darkness within the amulet to consume him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
