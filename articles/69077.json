Amidst the chaos, Jango Fett and his grunts made an improvised push toward the location of the True Mandalorians' targets, only to find a trap laid out for them by the Death Watch, a renegade Mandalorian splinter-faction in sworn opposition to the True Mandalorians. Fett's unit was able to repel the ambush\u2014killing several Death Watch troops using blasters and gauntlet-mounted flamethrowers\u2014and moved to reinforce their fellow True Mandalorians on the battlefield, but failed to reach their leader, Jaster Mereel, before he was mortally wounded by the Death Watch's own leader, Tor Vizsla. As Mereel died, Fett was chosen to succeed him as leader of the Mandalorians, and \"Jango's grunts\" dispersed back into the larger ranks of the True Mandalorian forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Jango's grunts\" were first introduced to Star Wars in the second issue of the Jango Fett: Open Seasons comic book series, written by Hayden Blackman and published June 17, 2002."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
