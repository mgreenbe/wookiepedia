It was a system of control over information and propaganda on Metalorn, allowing the Governor to keep his workers in total ignorance, save for the propaganda he wished them to know. For a time the program seemed to work well, to the extent that the workers of Metalorn did not even realize a Rebellion existed, but the actions of Leia Organa during the Mission to Metalorn revealed to some workers that they were being kept in ignorance. Leia Organa believed that this would result in workers rebelling against their Imperial masters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
