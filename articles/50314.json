They were the four primary obligations a Korun adhered to. From the Pillars came all other Korunnai traditions, rules, and customs. The Pillars were Honor, Duty, Family, and Herd, arranged in reverse order of importance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Pillars"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Honor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The First Pillar, Honor, was defined by Korunnai tradition as the obligation to oneself, primarily one's own reputation, and secondarily one's own safety. This Pillar advocated honesty, truthfulness, fearlessness, restraint, and unconditional love."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Duty"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "More important than Honor was the Second Pillar, Duty, which represented the obligation to others beyond the self. This Pillar advocated diligence in work and loyalty to elders and the gh\u00f4sh."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Family"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even greater than Duty was Family, the Third Pillar. It was similar in function to the Second Pillar, but with a much narrower scope, applying specifically toward love and care of one's immediate family. It advocated care for one's elderly parents, love of one's spouse and children, and defense of one's relatives."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Herd"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The supreme Pillar, superseding the demands of all else, was the Fourth Pillar, the Herd. The grasser herds of the Korunnai people were their only link to survival on the Korunnal Highland, they provided food and transportation, and without its herd, a gh\u00f4sh would die. Korunnai law demanded that one's allegiance lie, above all else, even one's own children, to the grassers of the herd, as they alone kept the race alive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
