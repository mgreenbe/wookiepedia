As such, he only allowed cadets at the academy a single 15-minute session every month and monitored the transmissions. When Zare Leonis desired something more private, he took the advice of his fellow cadet, Penn Zarang, and visited Jasko's in Scaparus Port. Jasko, a washout cadet, enjoyed irritating Hux by providing comm services that weren't monitored, though his prices were somewhat expensive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
