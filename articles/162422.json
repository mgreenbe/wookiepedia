Sometime prior to the Clone Wars, which broke out in 22 BBY, the droid began to serve moisture farmer Owen Lars' family at their moisture farm on the planet Tatooine. The droid worked with the protocol droid C-3PO for several years before the Jedi Anakin Skywalker, who had built C-3PO as a child, came to visit the Lars family at their moisture farm and took him away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droid continued to serve the Lars family for more than twenty years, leading into the time of the Galactic Civil War. It would do jobs such as helping the Lars' nephew Luke Skywalker to do a variety of chores including doing repair work on his uncle's moisture vaporators out in his desert. Although it appreciated working with Owen and Luke, WED-15-77 preferred working for Beru, as she would always ask it to do the same predictable jobs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One day in 0 BBY, WED-15-77 accompanied Luke Skywalker to repair his uncle's vaporators in the desert when Luke caught sight of a battle in the skies above between the Tantive IV and the Devastator."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "WED-15-77, also known as \"Treadwell\" in Star Wars Legends, was designed for the 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope by production designer John Barry. The same droid model was used for two other droids in the film's production, one of which was identified in Legends as WED-15-I662, but the other droid was never identified. Barry's notes show that the prop had one functioning arm, and that its base housed a radio controller that allowed for off-screen crew members to control it during filming. Barry's production sketch of WED-15-77 indicated that the prop stood between four and four and a half feet. Scenes featuring the droid were shot on location in Tunisia in March 1976."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When A New Hope entered post-production, Treadwell was the first of the droid characters to receive a voice from the film's sound designer Ben Burtt. To create its vocalizations, Burtt combined electric noises with sounds of himself speaking in a fake \"baby talk\". Although some crew members likened the voice to that of a talking chicken, director George Lucas ultimately approved the sound effects and Burtt's voice for Treadwell served as a template of sorts for the other droid characters in the film, including R2-D2. Treadwell made its first appearance in Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker, the novelization of A New Hope ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster and released in November 1976. The novel predated the film's release by over six months. The droid was originally featured in a scene with Luke Skywalker that was ultimately cut from the final release of A New Hope where Luke is in the Tatooine desert repairing a moisture vaporator when he notices shining objects in the sky. He uses his macrobinoculars at two ships that are engaged in combat beyond the atmosphere and jumps in his landspeeder, but Treadwell blows a fuse and is unable to follow. Although it was cut from the final film, the droid still appeared in the film's various adaptations including its previously released novelization as well as its storybook, radio drama, and manga."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "WED-15-77 eventually made its full movie appearance in the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. which made it one of the few characters to appear in both the original and prequel trilogy of Star Wars, even though its appearance in the original trilogy had been cut."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
