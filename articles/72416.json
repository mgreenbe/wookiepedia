The beast was essentially a parasitic organism native to the planet Mustafar, more specifically the equatorial region of the world. They began life as a small organism which would attach itself to a host, where it would begin gaining nourishment from the 'parent'. Eventually, it would burst forth in its adolescent stage and thus kill the host. From that point on, the Jundak would begin to slowly grow to adulthood. While deadly, it was discovered that the Jundak could not live outside beyond its native environment, which was fortunate for other forms of life. Despite this, however, some holodramas, such as \"It Came From Mustafar!\", tried to insinuate that Jundaks invaded another planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jundak appeared in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
