The funeral was attended by Jedi Master Plo Koon, Yoda, Mace Windu, Ki-Adi-Mundi, Saesee Tiin, Ahsoka Tano, Barriss Offee, Anakin Skywalker, Adi Gallia, Satine Kryze, Shaak Ti, Jar Jar Binks as well as Senators Mon Mothma, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, and Bail Prestor Organa and Chancellor Palpatine. Obi-Wan's \"body\" was clothed and lowered into a lower coffin chamber, and then sealed with a laser device. During the services, Tano expressed her concern about Skywalker's mood and lack of speech to Plo Koon since Kenobi's faked death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The purpose of this deception was for Obi-Wan to be able to go undercover as the bounty hunter Rako Hardeen while everyone believed him dead, so that he could uncover a plot to kidnap Chancellor Palpatine.
