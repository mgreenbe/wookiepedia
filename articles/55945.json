Located in the Mid Rim, the Graadorians' planet came to share its name with the Graador sector. The Graadorians drew scant attention from the Galactic Empire, the central authority in the galaxy during the Imperial Period, and for that reason, their homeworld was identified as a possible sanctuary for the Rebel Alliance Fleet; however, the presence of sentient, mutant mynocks and space slugs dissuaded the Rebel operatives who investigated the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Graadorians were a sentient species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Graadorians evolved on Graador, a planet located in the Graador system of the southwestern Mid Rim. Their homeworld was riddled with vast caverns, and while it was capable of supporting life, the planet contained little in the way of resources that the Graadorians could exploit. The Graadorians, therefore, developed an agrarian society. The space around the Graadorians' homeworld was explored between 1000 BBY and 25 BBY, and it eventually became integrated into the galaxy as the Graador sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the period of the Galactic Civil War, the Graadorians' homeworld was also populated by colossal space slugs and a species of mynocks who had mutated and achieved sentience; the mutant mynocks were able to control the space slugs. At that time, the ruling power of the galaxy, the Galactic Empire, paid little heed to Graadorian society. For that reason, after the Battle of Yavin, General Airen Cracken of the Rebel Alliance dispatched several operatives to Graador to scope out the planet as a possible refuge. The operatives initially approved Graador as suitable for the Alliance Fleet, but they reconsidered once they uncovered that the sentient mynocks and their space slug thralls posed a threat to the fleet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 137 ABY, the Graadorians' homeworld was part of the pan-galactic territory controlled by the Sith Lord Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Graadorians were created for the Rebellion Era Campaign Guide, co-authored by Rodney Thompson, Sterling Hershey, Owen Stephens, and J.D.
