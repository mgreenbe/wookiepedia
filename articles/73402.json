They had a series of forehead ridges and small facial horns surrounding their eyes and on the chin. Their noses were covered with a movable flap of skin and a semi-permeable membrane which allowed the Nikto to breathe without ingesting sand and grit. The Kajain'sa'Nikto also had a pair of breathing tubes on each side of the neck with openings covered by similar membranes. These membranes also trapped exhaled water vapor and sent it back into their system. The Kajain'sa'Nikto equivalent of smiling was a flattening of the mouth flaps."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the common moniker Red Nikto, blue-skinned Kajain'sa'Nikto were known to exist.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because they pledged loyalty to the Hutt families, numerous Kajain'sa'Nikto became Nikto guards, and lived to serve the Hutts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
