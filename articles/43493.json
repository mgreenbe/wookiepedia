With a more exaggerated helmet and far more advanced programming than standard dark troopers, these advanced battle droids were meant to serve as \"super soldiers\". They carried blaster cannons, SE-14c pistols, fragmentation grenades, thermal detonators, and concussion grenades. They, like all dark troopers, proved to be very effective in battle. Unlike Phase I dark troopers, these soldiers saw many more battles and were more experienced. The early elite dark troopers were cyborg clones, but were changed to droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
