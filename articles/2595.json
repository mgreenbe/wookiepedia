Building the AV-21 required the acquisition of two very rare parts obtainable only from the \"Corellian Corvette\" missions: the AV-21 vehicle schematic and AV-21 power plant. The schematic was the reward for completing the mission, while the power plant was a rare loot drop within the mission. As a result, the vehicle in game was seen as a luxury item, and players would be willing to purchase one for 2 to 3 million credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars Galaxies, the AV-21 could manage up to 17 meters per second in speed, which was the equal-fastest ground vehicle available in the game.
