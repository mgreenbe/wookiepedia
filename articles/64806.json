Providing an extensive account of the Order's history and origins, Orpin's greatest work was titled the \"Revan Mythologies\". Many of the stories contained in the mythologies tell tales of a mysterious reptilian species the Rakata, and how their Infinite Empire came to dominate the galaxy through the use of exotic machinery and hyper-space capable ships that employed the force as power. Jedi heroes in the Revan Mythologies often discover Rakatan devices of immense power, and were forced to choose between destroying the devices or being corrupted by their power. In the wake of the rise of the Galactic Empire and the destruction of the Jedi, Orpin's work was oft dismissed by scholars as myth and legends. These scholars believed that the mythologies were an updated derivative reworking of the Qel-Droma Epics to better acculturate Jedi younglings of the day."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
