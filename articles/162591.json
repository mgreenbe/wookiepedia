The term could also refer to especially large droids with legs (usually combat droids), though such droids were usually referred to using more specific terminology (such as \"spider droid\"). The All Terrain series contained some of the most well known examples of walkers. The designs for walkers utilized by the Galactic Empire were directly inspired by the successful use of animal cavalry from ancient civilizations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Walkers were first utilized during the Clone Wars, with then-Supreme Chancellor Palpatine even admitting that, while awe-inspiring, they also were a terrifying force to behold."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Owing to their use of legs for locomotion, they held several advantages to repulsorlift vehicles, including them being able to freely operate on worlds with atmospheric conditions that prohibit the operation of repulsorlift vehicles. As such, they are obviously immune to anti-repulsorlift jammers. In addition, part of the reason why the walkers were frequently designated as \"all-terrain\" was because they were able to react to changing surface conditions and shift footing similar to ordinary soldiers, unlike repulsorlift vehicles and/or treaded vehicles, and yet are still able to brace the ground against the recoil of heavy weaponry. They do have their weaknesses, however: Namely, while they are immune to anti-repulsorlift jammers, they are not immune to having their feet blown off by explosive mines."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Types of walkers"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Republic walkers"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Confederacy of Independent Systems walkers"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial walkers"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Eternal Alliance"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Corporate Sector Authority walkers"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "New Republic walkers"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Yuuzhan Vong walkers"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Walkers in other media"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars has popularized the use of various walkers and mechs in various media, from various Japanese anime to video games like Command and Conquer and Metal Gear.

The other, cited by Joe Johnston, was the Cybernetic Anthropomorphous Machine (CAM) that was commissioned by the United States Army for potential use in the Vietnam War before being abandoned by General Electric.
