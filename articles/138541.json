It carried only one laser cannon, as several sensors replaced the second laser cannon found on traditional TIE fighters. The TIE/gt starfighter was designed to be dependent on the precise targeting information provided by the TIE/fc starfighter, though large structures could still be destroyed without the TIE/fc's assistance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE/fc was primarily designed to scan an enemy base and transmit the information back to the fleet.
