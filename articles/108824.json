It was theorized the atomic structure of the pyronium itself stored the energy; when the quantum shells were unable to accommodate more, the energy was theoretically shunted into a localized hyperspatial matrix, making its absorptive potential extraordinarily high. The metal was so rare it was sometimes referred to as a jewel or gem."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jax Pavan was known to have a large and unflawed nugget of it, given to him by Anakin Skywalker while he was still a Jedi Padawan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
