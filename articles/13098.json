Though trained in TIE Fighters, the disintegrating state in which the Imperial Remnant found itself prior to the Pellaeon\u2013Gavrisom Treaty\u2014and the legalization of open trade between the two rival parties\u2014forced Colonel Bas to include Preybird-class starfighters in his fighter wing. Despite misgivings about the usefulness of such craft, Bas personally witnessed their effectiveness in a skirmish with hostile pirates claiming to be Garm Bel Iblis where, following Paelleon's orders, he used his starfighters to effectively execute an A-wing Slash."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
