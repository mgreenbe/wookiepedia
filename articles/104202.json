With its sleek outline, it presented less of a target to potential enemies, while at the same time optimizing its shield protection."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The forward-sloping superstructure of the Pellaeon-class also gave the main gun batteries excellent vantage points, more so than on the Star Destroyers of the previous centuries."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The class had slightly more armament than the older Imperial II-class Star Destroyer. Some of these guns were of a similar design to the XX-9 turbolaser batteries of the old Galactic Empire. The Pellaeon-class also possessed an interdiction field, capable of pulling ships out of hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Complement"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The class had a ventral hangar where starfighters and shuttles could land and embark from. Predator-class fighters would be stored in racks in narrow passages throughout the hangar area. Traffic control centers were located on either side of the main hangar opening, overlooking the area."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Its sloping profile allowed the Pellaeon-class to be shorter than the Imperial-class while at the same time be able to carry a decent amount of landing craft and small starships."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Propulsion systems"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A reactor bulb protrusion was visible outside the ventral hull.

The original idea entailed not making the vessel incredibly long, like the Executor, but incredibly tall and with a cathedral-like aspect to the design. The refined design harked back to the original Star Destroyers, but with a \"front plow\" addition based on the Khetanna, Jabba the Hutt's sail barge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the actual number of guns on the Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer are currently unknown, the ship's entry in Starships of the Galaxy lists a number of weapon batteries, which according to the Star Wars Roleplaying Game Saga Edition Core Rulebook, represent up to ten weapons of the same type per battery."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An image of the Pellaeon was used to represent a Harrower-class dreadnought bombarding Coruscant in Timeline 1: Treaty of Coruscant, as the ship's design had not yet been finalized at the time of the video's creation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
