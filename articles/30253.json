They began collecting Sith artifacts including what they believed was Darth Vader's lightsaber to burn in order to reunite with their former Sith owners after death. Later, other Acolytes including Remi and the Pantoran Kiza also surfaced on the Corellian city of Coronet City. Their activities including tagging walls with the Vader mask sigil and the warning \"VADER LIVES\", stealing credits, slicing into the HoloNet, and attacking Corellian peace officers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Acolytes then decided to launch a coordinate attack on Coronet City in order to steal a Sith lightsaber from the archives beneath the city's Peace and Security station. The archives were part of a shared basement with the museum nextdoor. As part of the plan, the Acolytes falsified papers which allowed Kiza to infiltrate the station disguised as a dame from the secretary pool. Her lover Remi also allowed himself to be captured by the detective Erno, who intended the boy for vandalism. His task was to steal the lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The attack"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before Erno could interrogate Remi, the security officer Spob Rydel informed him that the Acolytes were launching attacks throughout Coronet City. The Acolytes attacked various areas throughout the city including Diadem Square, where they mobbed storefronts and leapt on top of the air-tuks to pull the speeders down to the ground. Other Acolytes swarmed the 1-line of the mag-lev subway, the train stops at the Juni Street Station, and assaulted pedestrians at the city's casinos. These Acolytes were armed with red sticks and wore masks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Erno returned to the interrogation room only to learn that Remi had disappeared. In fact, Remi had retrieved the lightsaber from the basement. After the emergency lights had come up, Erno headed into the main room to join Rydel and the detectives Shreen and Mursey. Before he could speak to Rydel, Kiza shot Rydel in the forehead. Kiza then gunned down Shreen and Mursey, killing them. Erno tried to reach for his blaster. When he asked Kiza what was going on, she replied that she was no longer his doll. She described the attack as a revolution, the revenge of the darkness, and oblivion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Erno attempted to shoot Kiza but Remi sliced off his hand with his newly-acquired lightsaber. Remi remarked to Kiza that he had told her the weapon was in the basement. After confirming that the blade was the weapon they had been looking for, Kiza clubbed Erno in the head. She then told him that Vader lived and to tell everyone that the Acolytes were coming."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Coronet City revolution, Kiza and Remi's Acolytes cell traveled to the Colonies world of Devaron.
