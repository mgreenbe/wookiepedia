He succeeded Chi Cho as the Chairman of the Pantoran Assembly during the Clone Wars. Father to a Republic Senator, Chi Eekway, Baron Papanoida was an influential figure in Coruscant affairs, a well-known intelligence provider, anti-Palpatinist, and lover of the performance arts\u2014he was known to frequent the finest auditoriums and holo-entertainment venues, including the Galaxies Opera House in the Uscru Entertainment District."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Papanoida fathered several children, including Ion, Che Amanwe, and Chi Eekway. Papanoida was once a humble playwright on his homeworld of Pantora, and had a number of hits that became immensely popular among his people. The success of his plays helped fund Papanoida's growing entertainment empire, and Papanoida himself became an influential trade guild baron. He kept much of his past shrouded in mystery, so it was not known how Baron Papanoida was able to cultivate his information network that some claimed even rivaled the famed Bothan Spynet. He spent some time working in the Wroonian holodrama industry and during that period, he acquired and refurbished the Rainhawk-class transport Falfa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the death of Chairman Chi Cho during a conflict on the ice moon of Orto Plutonia, Papanoida was appointed as the new chairman. When the Trade Federation blockaded Pantora, public unrest threatened to force the moon to secede from the Republic and join the Separatists, who were offering aid. Papanoida relied on Senator Riyo Chuchi to plead for assistance in the Senate in ending the blockade. However, the Federation had his two daughters kidnapped as leverage. Papanoida could guess that his daughters might be on the Droid Control Ship blockading Pantora and dispatched Chuchi and Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano to go there under the pretense of a diplomatic mission, while he and his son Ion do their own investigation. Whereas the Coruscant Security Force failed to find any clues in his quarters, Papanoida discovered that one of his idols was misplaced and smeared with blood. Analyzing the blood, he found that it belonged to a Rodian bounty hunter named Greedo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Pantorans traveled to the palace of Jabba Desilijic Tiure on Tatooine, whom Greedo was employed by. Papanoida was able to draw the Rodian out by simply telling a female Twi'lek that they were looking for him. As expected, Greedo came to the Pantorans and attempted to get rid of them, only for Papanoida to pull out a knife and hold it against Greedo's throat. Matters were brought before Jabba, whom Papanoida managed to reason with into assisting them, by comparing Greedo's blood to the sample he found on Coruscant. No sooner that Jabba permitted it did Greedo spill that he had Chi Eekway held in Mos Eisley. The Pantorans forced Greedo to lead them to the cantina where Eekway was being held. But things got tense, as Greedo's Gotal partner began to question him. The Rodian turned on the Pantorans and fled the cantina, as all the patrons started firing on them. The Pantorans were able to dispatch all the assailants; Eekway even saved her father's life by shooting the Gotal when he attempted to kill Papanoida when his back was turned. The Pantorans returned to Coruscant as Chuchi and Tano rescued Che Amanwe from the Droid Control Ship. Because the Federation lacked leverage, they were forced to end the blockade of Pantora."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the Clone Wars, Papanoida made frequent visits to the Galaxies Opera House; his love of the performing arts was one of the few aspects of his life Papanoida did not keep hidden. Papanoida was present at a performance of Squid Lake following the Battle of Coruscant, which Supreme Chancellor Palpatine also attended. Papanoida was an outspoken critic of Palpatine, though he did not concern himself with any overt political actions against the Chancellor, such as the growing Delegation of 2000. Papanoida instead relied on funneling information to Senators of conscience, including his young daughter Chi Eekway, who was the representative of Wroona."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Baron Papanoida served the Galactic Republic as an intelligence agent, though there was some question as to the Baron's true allegiance\u2014it was rumored that he was, in fact, a double agent, loyal only to himself. This may have explained why he informed the Jedi Council that there was no Separatist presence on Utapau: a claim Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi later proved false when he discovered the headquarters of General Grievous in Pau City. Papanoida did not comment on whether this was a genuine mistake or a deliberate omission\u2014a stance that only added to his shifty reputation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thanks to his discretion towards his opposition of Palpatine, N. Papanoida was able to retain his standing as the Republic transitioned into the First Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Baron Papanoida was portrayed by film director and Star Wars creator George Lucas in Revenge of the Sith.
