In 10 ABY, after Palpatine's elite cadre of Dark Jedi, the Dark Side Elite, suffered losses due to the efforts of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker and his Jedi, Sha was chosen to reinforce the group. The Emperor empowered Sha and a fellow darksider named Xecr Nist with the dark side of the Force; Nist became the Emperor's newest Executor, while Sha was appointed as Palpatine's second-in-command."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Sha participated in an attack on the New Republic hideout on the planet New Alderaan. Tasked with incapacitating Skywalker by poisoning him with miniature scarab droids so he could be taken captive, Sha and the Dark Jedi Krdys Mordi infiltrated Skywalker's personal quarters while he was asleep and released the droids. However, the Jedi's screams alerted his sister, Leia Organa Solo, and the Jedi trainee Jem Ysanna, who rushed to his aid.

After the Emperor's return later the same year, Tedryn-Sha, along with a darksider named Xecr Nist and the Imperial engineer Umak Leth, joined Palpatine on an inspection tour of his newest superweapon, the Galaxy Gun, which was being constructed in orbit of the world of Byss, the capital of Palpatine's Dark Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they were performing the inspection aboard a shuttle, Palpatine was notified that Executor Sedriss QL and Vill Goir, two members of the Dark Side Elite, Palpatine's elite cadre of Dark Jedi, had been killed by Skywalker on the planet Ossus. To replace the fallen Dark Jedi, Palpatine chose Tedryn-Sha and Xecr Nist, empowering them with the dark side of the Force. The ritual was so powerful that it caused a disturbance in the Force, which was even felt by Skywalker back on Ossus. Palpatine then named Nist the new Executor, thus placing him in charge of the entire Imperial Military, while Tedryn-Sha became Palpatine's second-in-command."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While those events transpired, a shipment of X-1 Viper droids, procured from Governor Hinch Beltane of the planet Balmorra, arrived on Byss aboard the star hauler Reliance. However, Beltane had secretly betrayed the Empire and had allowed the New Republic to smuggle a group of commandos within the droids. After the droids were delivered to the Emperor's Citadel, the infiltrators powered them up. Sha then bore witness as the New Republic forces launched their attack on the Emperor's fortress. In response, the Emperor gave the order to release fearsome chrysalide rancors, which repelled the Viper droids' attack. Nonetheless, the New Republic troops escaped from Byss with the help of local smugglers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having complete confidence in the power of the Galaxy Gun, Palpatine gave his forces the order to let the fleeing smuggler ships go, a command that took his newly appointed Dark Jedi by surprise.

The Emperor believed that the Jedi would take refuge on the same planet that served as the secret hiding place of Leia Organa Solo and her children\u2014the twins Jaina and Jacen. Sha's Master hoped to capture the children so he could turn them over to the dark side, but he needed to learn the location of the planet first. The opportunity presented itself when a New Republic pilot, Major Ntthan, was captured by the Empire in an uncharted region of space while making a supply run to the New Republic hideout. The pilot was promptly delivered to Bast Castle on the planet Vjun, the headquarters of the Dark Side Elite, where Dark Jedi Kvag Gthull started interrogating him in order to learn Organa Solo's location."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sha and Nist accompanied Palpatine to Bast Castle aboard the Lambda-class shuttle Tridius to oversee the results of the interrogation. When they arrived, Gthull informed Palpatine and the Dark Jedi that after a twelve-hour-long torture session, Ntthan had revealed the coordinates and the name of the planet\u2014New Alderaan. Palpatine ordered Nist to assemble all Dark Jedi and embark on a mission there. The darksiders were to infiltrate the city of New Aldera and capture Skywalker and the Solo children, after which the Empire would launch a full-scale assault on the settlement using All Terrain Armored Transports."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boarding I-7 Howlrunner starfighters, Sha and the rest of the Dark Side Elite embarked on a journey toward their goal as part of Dark Side Squadron. Upon exiting hyperspace near New Alderaan, Sha consulted the ship's sensors but was unable to detect the presence of Skywalker and his allies.

Although the Jedi Master did not notice the ships, he almost sensed the presence of the Dark Jedi through the Force, a result of Sha failing to mask his Force presence well enough. After Dark Side Squadron landed their ships, Nist reprimanded Sha for his mistake. The Executor then dispatched Sha and Dark Jedi Krdys Mordi to Skywalker's quarters, providing the pair with a number of tiny scarab droids, which carried a powerful poison capable of incapacitating the Jedi. Sha and Mordi were to release the droids upon Skywalker, who was battling Palpatine in his sleep, as the Emperor had entered the Jedi's dreams and was haunting him there. Nist himself took the rest of the Dark Jedi and went after the Solo twins."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Making sure to hide their Force presence from Skywalker this time, Sha and Mordi successfully reached the building that housed Skywalker's quarters. Releasing the scarab droids upon him through a window to his room, the two watched as the droids began their work on immobilizing the Jedi. However, just as Sha and Mordi entered the room and moved in to claim their captive, Skywalker cried out in his sleep, resisting the Emperor's influence. That scream alerted Organa Solo and Ysanna, who arrived at the scene ready to defend the Jedi Master. As a result, Mordi was immediately killed, sliced in half by Ysanna with her lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Certain in his powers as the Emperor's second-in-command and knowing that Palpatine wanted Organa Solo to be taken alive if possible, as she was pregnant with her third child, Sha gave the women a chance to surrender, but Organa Solo refused and fired her blaster at Sha. The Dark Jedi blocked her shot with his hand and, in response, shot Ysanna square in the abdomen with his own blaster pistol. Not skilled enough yet to avoid the shot, Ysanna was gravely wounded by it. Sha was then struck down by the infuriated Organa Solo, who cleaved him in half with her own lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker was healed from the poison by the Jedi Vima-Da-Boda with the Force, while Nist and the rest of the darksiders were defeated by Skywalker's remaining Jedi.

Sha addressed his superior darksider using the honorific title of \"Lord\" and did not argue with his reprimands."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sha took pride in being the Emperor's second-in-command and boasted on this ranking before Organa Solo, whom he recognized as the daughter of Palpatine's deceased apprentice, Darth Vader. Upon first arrival at Bast Castle, Sha was awed to discover a statue of Vader there\u2014erected by the late Sedriss QL\u2014and he realized that the Castle had once belonged to Vader himself.
