But after the Big Crush, the planet was torn apart into fragments and sent hurtling through the system. By the time of the Battle of Mindor, the asteroids still had not had enough time to stabilize into a settled orbit, and were still flying through the system, making travel through the vicinity of the former planet very hazardous."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the time of the Big Crush, a group of Melters, energy-based beings that lived in a natural substance called meltmassif resided on the planet.

In 1 ABY the facility was abandoned after a cataclysmic event called the Big Crush, where the planet was torn to pieces after a mishap while testing a gravity well projector. Afterward, all that was left of Taspan II was an asteroid field, akin to the Graveyard of Alderaan. The debris from Taspan II's destruction had not had time to stabilize as of 5 ABY, and debris was still hurtling through the Taspan system, making its sister planet Mindor, also known as Taspan I, almost inaccessible."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The debris was later used to the advantage of Empire warlord Shadowspawn during his campaign against the New Republic in 5 ABY. Shadowspawn set up his main base of operations on the former resort planet of Mindor, hidden by the flying asteroids. In 5 ABY, the New Republic battled Shadowspawn's forces at Mindor, led by Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker. During the Battle of Mindor, the culmination of Shadowspawn's efforts, planetesimals in the Taspan system, including the fragments of Taspan II, were captured by the gravitational pull of the star Taspan. The impact of the fragments making contact with the star emitted hard radiation and flares, which tore through Mindor's surface."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Taspan II was first mentioned in Matthew Stover's novel Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor, released in 2008.
