At that time, he had sided with the Confederacy of Independent Systems in their fight against the Galactic Republic. This Geonosian was a notably skilled mechanic and was placed in charge of the Tambor Deep Space Centre which was servicing the Confederate Navy. It was the efforts of this mobile shipyard that aided General Grievous in striking Republic positions throughout known space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This eventually led to the Republic dispatching Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Mace Windu along with Clone Commander Ponds and Cody to assault the facility. They, along with their clone trooper detachments, managed to board the station, but were ambushed by battle droid forces that were attached to the station as Gorgol's security forces. Gorgol the Handy later used his controller to remotely activate the deep space center's defenses which allowed him to eliminate the clone known as Swift as well as his group of AT-RT troopers. This later prompted an apparent surrender from the Republic forces which Gorgol was willing to accept as he believed he would be rewarded by General Grievous, but discovered that it was a carefully laid out trap. Ambushed by the remaining Republic soldiers and the Jedi, Gorgol attempted to flee but was caught in the sight of Commander Cody's blaster. Rather than kill Gorgol, the clone simply destroyed his controller. Gorgol was arrested with the intention of him being placed in a detention center for his crimes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
