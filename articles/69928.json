A Jedi general was the commanding officer of a battalion of clone troopers\u2014elite soldiers cloned from the template of Jango Fett and conditioned to follow orders with absolute obedience. As generals, the Jedi had various wartime responsibilities such as leading troops on the battlefield or coordinating strategy with the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. The Jedi High Council was the governing body of the Jedi Order; therefore its members directed the rest of the Jedi in their role as military leaders. However, the Council could also make forays onto the battlefield, serving as warriors alongside their troopers as Jedi Master Mace Windu demonstrated during the campaign to liberate Ryloth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clone troopers were subject to the authority of their Jedi Generals. They were loyal to the Jedi and the Republic, although there were instances of disobedience among the rank-and-file. In such cases a Jedi could exercise their authority as a general by ordering the arrest and court-martial of an offending clone. If the offense was treason, it was within the general's authority to have the prisoner summarily executed.

Under the Jedi High Council's skillful leadership, the clone army was able to achieve both air and ground supremacy against the forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Following their victory on Geonosis, the Jedi Order's role in the military forces of the Galactic Republic was made official, with Jedi Knights and Jedi Masters holding the rank of Jedi General by the time of the Battle of Arantara."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout the Clone Wars, the Jedi generals commanded the loyalty of the clone troopers who followed them into battle across the galaxy.

Unknown to the clones, secret behavioral modification biochips had been designed and integrated into them to compel them to follow Order 66 without hesitation as part of a Sith plot to destroy the Jedi and gain control of the galaxy.
