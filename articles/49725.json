They were generally rectangular in shape, with the long axis lying parallel to the floor on which they generally rested. Latches kept the hinged lids from swinging up, and they could be locked to provide secure storage. Footlockers could be found anywhere in the galaxy, however they were frequently found in military bases, especially in barracks, armories, and storerooms, as well as warships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
