The moon had been turned into a massive graveyard after a terrible war on the planet, with ships bringing thousands of bodies to the mass graves. A band of grave robbers eventually joined forces and formed the Bando Gora, which comprised of skilled assassins who became known as some of the most ruthless in the galactic underworld."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The cult ruled through fear in the Outer Rim and uncivilized worlds in the galaxy, often killing those who stood in their way or refused to convert. Their ruthless assassination attacks began crippling the galaxy's most powerful industries. Shortly after the Battle of Galidraan, the cult attacked the planet Baltizaar. The Galactic Republic requested Jedi intervention, but the Jedi were under-prepared to face the power of the Bando Gora. The Jedi were almost overwhelmed and many died, but the cult was eventually driven off."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One unauthorized member of the Jedi task force was Komari Vosa, who was captured by the cult with two others and brutally tortured. Succumbing to the dark side of the Force, she broke free and slaughtered both her captors and fellow captives before taking leadership of the cult."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Members of the cult became hideous, with black mottled skin and glowing red or blue eyes. Bando Gora captains usually wore terrifying masks with long, downward horns and carried staffs which emitted green balls of fire. Shortly after the Battle of Naboo, the Bando Gora produced a potent strain of death stick which contained even more powerful narcotics and was used to help brainwash victims."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Forming an alliance with Black Sun, Gardulla Besadii the Elder, and Ars Veruna, the corrupt king of Naboo, the Bando Gora helped stage an attack on Sojourn, the fortress of Sith Lord Darth Plagueis and an enemy of Veruna's. Secretly, the assassination attempt had been organized by Plagueis's apprentice, Darth Sidious. The Dark Lord had sent his apprentice, Darth Maul, to the prison of Cog Hive Seven to find a reclusive and influential arms dealer named Iram Radique and acquire the nuclear bomb he was developing inside the prison. However, Radique's hatred of the Bando Gora (who had tried to kill him once in the past) made the attempt to broker the deal all the more difficult. Eventually, however, Maul killed Radique and the bomb was delivered to the Bando Gora. They later used it to destroy Sojourn. Plagueis escaped, however, with help from Gardulla's rival, Jabba Desilijic Tiure. Following the attack, revenge was meted out by the Sith Lord: Darth Maul was sent to wipe out Black Sun's leadership, Plagueis personally dealt with Veruna, and Gardulla's fate was left for Jabba to decide. The Bando Gora escaped the wrath of the Sith, however."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Darth Plagueis's death at Sidious's hands during the Naboo crisis, the new Dark Lord of the Sith began to consider the Bando Gora to be a dangerous threat and feared what they could do with a former Jedi like Komari Vosa as their leader. He instructed his new apprentice, Darth Tyranus, Komari Vosa's former Jedi Master, to have her executed and the cult destroyed so it couldn't threaten their long-term plans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dooku hired bounty hunters Jango Fett and Montross to track down Vosa for a sum of 5 million Republic credits, an offer few could refuse. After chasing the Dark Jedi down to Kohlma, the burial moon of Bogden, and defeating his rival, Fett penetrated Vosa's heavily defended fortress and engaged her in a furious battle. He finally bested Komari, but spared her life. Dooku, who somehow seemed to be present, had other ideas and used the dark side to choke her to death, decapitating the Bando Gora cult and ending their reign of terror. He revealed that he knew the location of Vosa all along, that this was a test and made an agreement with Jango for him to become the template for a clone army."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
