The conflict took place after Vader brought the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 aboard the ship. The Dark Lord attempted to turn R2 to the dark side, but the droid refused, drawing a lightsaber. A short duel ensued with R2 using rocket boosters to maneuver around the Sith Lord. The astromech gained the upper hand, knocking the lightsaber out of Darth Vader's hand and then cutting the control box off of his armor. Badly crippled and unable to breathe, Vader was caught off guard when C-3PO backed up into him and knocked him into a carbon-freezing chamber. The Dark Lord of the Sith was frozen in carbonite to the excitement of the two droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
