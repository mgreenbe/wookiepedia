Around 3978 BBY, he was chosen by the Sith Emperor to act as his emissary to the current Mandalore, Mandalore the Ultimate, the leader of the Mandalorian warriors. He was sent to the planet Mandalore and managed to convince Mandalore to help in his search for the Emperor's half-brother's tomb. After Mandalore helped the Sith find the tomb on the planet Rekkiad, the emissary retrieved the remains to bring back to the Emperor. He then told Mandalore of the vision his Master had seen of the Mandalorians rising up and defeating the Galactic Republic. He told Mandalore of how his Master saw the Mandalorians conquering many worlds, and of how they would crush the Republic until it collapsed on itself, promising Mandalore a glorious victory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two years later, the Mandalorians went on to invade the Republic, crushing countless worlds in the process, until in 3963 BBY the Jedi Knight Revan and his faction of Jedi joined the war.

Only as Mandalore lay dying did he realize that he and his people were betrayed by the Sith and the emissary they sent, and that they were never meant to win the war but to test the Republic's strength.
