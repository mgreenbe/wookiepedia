It was purchased by the Zirtran brothers. On the initial hyperspace jump, its hyperdrives failed completely, leaving the Zirtrans with a stranded ship in the middle of nowhere. A group of Geelans subsequently bought the ship and converted into a space station that would eventually be known as Zirtran's Anchor. Among the denizens of Zirtran's Anchor, KV-29233-44B was better known as \"The Hub\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
