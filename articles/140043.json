During his career, Dree was wanted by the Galactic Empire and a bounty of 10,000 credits was placed on his head. At some point, he was aboard a freighter, the Dorion Discus, as it left the planet Thorgeld I along with the ship's captain, the smuggler Roark Garnet, Garnet's daughter, Jill, and her grandfather, Jackson Farseeker. While breaking orbit, the Dorion Discus was hailed by the Imperial Customs Frigate Assessor wanting to perform a customs inspection. Dree made it clear to Garnet that the Imperials could not discover him aboard, or the smuggler would face the consequences. Jill suggested that they could hide Dree by having him exit the vessel and trailing behind the ship holding onto a rope.

Almost immediately after Dree had made the remark, an ominous clicking sound began to originate from the freighter's upper hull, in addition to slight fluctuations in its power output.

Wanted by the Empire, he has no qualms about threatening his companions to ensure his safety, or firing at Imperial ships.
