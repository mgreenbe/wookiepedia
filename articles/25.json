Since the bolt caster was not an ion blaster, it was also devastating when used against organics, although to a lesser degree than when used against droids and cyborgs. It was however limited by its short range and slow rate of fire."

Seeing its effectiveness against droids and its usefulness as a weapon, many soldiers began wielding it against battle droids and other enemies that they encountered. After realizing its undeniable capability as a weapon, Drever Corp promptly produced the \"DN bolt caster\" for use as an expensive yet highly efficient weapon against droid armies."
