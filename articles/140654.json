Following the race, a number of spectators traveled to Tathin, where the post-race award ceremony was held. Several booths were set up by some Cularin natives for the duration of the event, including ones ran by the Cularin Militia, the Jedi of the Almas Academy, Lony Hertz's Force Adept Club, Seelana's Droids and Nenmo's Curios. A group of mercenaries led by the Zabrak Dantin Vellos detonated a number of grenades in the village in an attempt to murder Osten Dal'Nay, the leader of the Cularin Militia. However, they only succeeded in destroying Tathin's medical center and an injured Dal'Nay fled into the jungle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
