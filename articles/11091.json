Rae survived the Jedi Purge and believed both Tuum and Skywalker to be dead, prompting her to put her past behind her and become a bounty hunter.

There, she was reunited with Rasi Tuum and was ordered by her fellow Imperial Knight Marasiah Fel to accompany Skywalker on a mission to assassinate Darth Krayt. The mission led Skywalker's strike team to Had Abbadon, where they lured Krayt into a trap and managed to mortally wound him after Rae stabbed him through the chest. She herself was brought to the brink of death by Krayt's Force lightning, and Skywalker rushed her to Kiffex to be healed by his uncle Rawk.

Rae promised to serve the Force through dedication to Fel and his throne. Her training began, and her understanding of the Force expanded. She constructed her own lightsaber, different from the standardized model of the order and with an orange rather than a silver blade. After completing her training and becoming a full-fledged Imperial Knight, Rae earned the rank of \"Master,\" a title reserved for the order's highest-ranking members.

Rae and Rawk battled telekinetically with the Force before Rae drew her lightsaber on the older man. He responded by brushing her arm out of the way and elbowing her in the face, knocking her out of the fight. Skywalker recovered and approached the two, prompting Rae to remove her mask and reveal her face. Surprised to see her, Skywalker invited her into Rawk's home to drink some caf. Therein, she sat down with Skywalker, Rawk, Rawk's wife Droo, Skywalker's co-pilot Jariah Syn, and his mechanic, Deliah Blue. Rae told them of her past since the Sith's attack on Coruscant but left out any mention of the Imperial Knights, claiming to still be a bounty hunter and to have pursued Skywalker in the interest of collecting the bounty on his head. She also claimed to no longer be interested in collecting it, having realized that Skywalker was the same friend she remembered from her childhood. At that moment, Rawk's long-range sensors detected the arrival of a Star Destroyer in the system, belonging to Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire.

As a greeting party arrived to welcome the Mynock's crew, the Jedi Knight Shado Vao saw Marasiah and her companions depart their ship and drew his lightsaber. He and Skywalker engaged Draco and Krieg in a duel, and after a furious Skywalker Force-pushed the two Knights away, he realized that Rae had betrayed him and began shouting at her. Marasiah asserted that the Imperial Knights were on a diplomatic mission and placed Rae within its safe conduct, and as tensions began to die down, the Imperial delegation was brought to see the Jedi Council.

She left to consider his words and sought out Marasiah in the quarters that had been assigned to them. Marasiah, too, could sense Rae's conflict, and reminded her that the oaths she had sworn were lifelong. She also stressed that the only Imperial Knight to have ever left the order had died soon after. While Rae struggled with her dilemma, the Jedi Council refused Skywalker's request for help in his mission to assassinate Darth Krayt. He was determined to proceed without their assistance, however, and Marasiah assigned Rae, Draco, and Krieg to accompany him while she remained behind to continue negotiating with the Jedi.

As she spoke to his door, the ship was drawn out of hyperspace by the interdiction field of the Star Destroyer Iron Sun, which Old Republic Jedi Celeste Morne had commandeered ten years before and kept dormant in the Deep Core. Skywalker emerged from the captain's quarters and accused Rae of interdicting them, and the two argued on their way to the bridge. No TIE predators or other ships came out of the Destroyer to meet them, and when the Mynock was locked in a tractor beam, Skywalker and Vao sensed the presence of a Force-user aboard the warship. The strike team set out to explore the derelict vessel, and Rae's party, including herself, Skywalker, Syn and Vao, found nothing but bones in the hangar bay. Draco and Krieg commed Rae from adjacent corridors and reported similar discoveries, and as Rae's party mulled over their findings, a group of Rakghoul beasts emerged from a doorway and attacked them.

While they waited for the metamorphosis to occur, Morne told them of her past and how she had come to wear the Muur Talisman in order to keep Karness Muur's spirit contained. Rae and Skywalker began bleeding, and Skywalker, desperate, asked Morne if the Rakghoul plague was a disease. When she replied in the affirmative, Skywalker grabbed Rae and called on his healing powers to rid both of them of their ailment. Their minds flashed back to their youth together as energy surrounded them, and their disease vanished.

After being scratched, Reave fled, and a telekinetic push from Morne prevented Rae and Skywalker from pursuing him. She had decided to allow Reave to report to Krayt, hoping that the bait of the Muur Talisman would lure the Sith Lord into their trap. As the strike team prepared themselves for Krayt's arrival, Rae was approached by Krieg, and the two discussed romantic feelings that he had for her.

All of the Sith Lords save Wyyrlok confronted Morne and Skywalker, before Rae, Krieg, Draco, and Vao emerged from hiding, having managed to conceal themselves in the Force. The six members of the strike team attacked the Sith, aided somewhat by Morne's unpredictable army of Rakghouls, who ended up cutting the Imperial Knights off from the battle.

She lamented the fact that she would never feel anything on her skin again and once again wanted to die."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rae gained some of her will to live back after Hogrum Chalk fitted her with a more practical suit of armor and was eager to test out its capabilities in battle. She was once again fully dedicated to the Imperial Knights and the Emperor, going to great efforts to keep Princess Marasiah Fel out of the Sith's clutches. Although she had been unconscious when Marasiah had been taken by the Sith, Rae felt that she had failed her duty by not having prevented it. Rasi Tuum attempted to dissuade her from pursuing Marasiah into a Sith\u2013Imperial Star Destroyer, but she insisted that her duty demanded she try. Pragmatism won out in the end, however, when Rae realized that she could not take on an entire Sith\u2013Imperial fleet in a single attack ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although she served an organization that viewed the Force as a tool, Rae believed in the will of the Force.

She believed him to be dead after the Jedi Order was scattered by the Sith, and she put her past, including memories of Skywalker, behind her as she began a new life. Although she deceived him and earned his ire after reuniting with him seven years later, their memories came flooding back to both of them when he used the Force to heal them of the Rakghoul plague. Both of them realized that they had always loved each other, and they spent an intimate night together on Had Abbadon. When Rae was almost killed during battle with the Sith, Skywalker expended a considerable amount of Force energy to keep her alive, nearly falling to the dark side as he did so. He ignored Rae's wishes to die and ensured her survival, claiming that it was out of love. Rae was then placed in a life-preserving suit, and she lashed out at Skywalker, accusing him of keeping her alive for selfish reasons. The two parted ways, but Skywalker continued to think of Rae as one of the most important people in his life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Azlyn Rae was trained in the ways of the Force by both the Jedi Order and the Imperial Knights, two organizations whose members were said to be among the most talented and powerful Force-users in the galaxy. After becoming a full-fledged Imperial Knight, she possessed a unique diversity of training that led to her often being assigned by the Emperor on missions as a scout or undercover agent. She showed prowess as a scout, pursuing Cade Skywalker from Socorro to Iego without being noticed. She was also skilled at deception, able to lie to Skywalker and his friends and convince them to trust her while she was actually using them to smuggle her fellow Imperial Knights into the Jedi's Hidden Temple."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rae was skilled in various uses of the Force, including telekinesis and mind tricks. She could also sense others in the Force at great distances. Rae survived a battle with a group of Sith on Agamar that saw several Imperial Knights fall, killing at least one Sith during the melee. She later participated in the defense of the Jedi's Hidden Temple and was able to down an Imperial walker alongside Ganner Krieg. During the Battle of Coruscant, Rae fought in a strike team that killed a number of Sith as well as several of Darth Krayt's Sith troopers. Her stabbing of Darth Krayt on Had Abbadon was the first of several strikes that led to his defeat, although the encounter nearly killed her as well.

Hogrum Chalk, the master armorer of the Imperial Knights, later built a new set of armor for her that negated the need for a helmet by installing an artificial breathing system in the suit's neck. It resembled the crimson armor of the Imperial Knights and protected Rae from suffering a fatal injury when she was knocked unconscious by an explosion on Agamar.

Rae went on to play a major role in six further issues of the series in 2008, including Legacy's chapters of Star Wars: Vector, a crossover event that occurred throughout all four Star Wars comic titles then being published by Dark Horse Comics. In the final third of 2008, Legacy's pages were home to Vector's conclusion, and Ostrander and Duursema spent much of the year moving various pieces of the story into motion in preparation for that conclusion. Azlyn Rae was one of those pieces, and in Vector's final issue, she directly contributed to the apparent death of Darth Krayt.
