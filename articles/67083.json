The ship was built by Corellian Engineering Corporation and primarily used as a long-haul cargo and troop transport. It was equipped with forward and rear guns to defend against pirates. The vehicle was also equipped with a hyperdrive. The versatility of the vessel made it indispensable for the Resistance and critical for transporting troops between bases."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An individual I-TS designated Cargo vessel TR141 was once stationed at the Resistance encampment at the ancient ruins just outside the Black Spire Outpost on Batuu, but was later captured by a First Order Resurgent-class Star Destroyer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This transport was first seen as part of a model of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge revealed by Disney.
