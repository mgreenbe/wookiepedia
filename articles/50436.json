The ceremony involved taking individuals powerful in the Living Force to the Frangawl Temple, a subterranean temple where the cult was headquartered on Bardotta. The leader of the cult would chant, and then push the sacrifice down an oiled slide into the maw of a statue of Malmourral. At the statue's jaw, the sacrifice would be electrocuted by green lightning, transferring their Living Force into the living sphere. Their lifeless bodies would then be dropped into the magma below."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 BBY, the leader of the cult, Peteen, sacrificed multiple members of the Bahk-tov Council as part of the ritual, however while attempting to sacrifice Queen Julia, he was interrupted by Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks and Jedi Master Mace Windu, who were sent by the Galactic Republic to help the Bardottans discover who was behind the disappearances of the Bahk-tov Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the efforts of Windu and Binks, Peteen escaped with Julia, taking her to the Temple of Malmourral on the moon Zardossa Stix.
