It was headquarters of Viper Sensor Intelligence Systems and home to its Vulpter-based offices. Shortly before the outbreak of the Clone Wars in the year 22 BBY, 60 AAD-4 assault droids belonging to VSIS competitor Arakyd Industries entered Viper Tower just prior to the end of the business day and quickly eliminated its ground-floor security units. The remaining Viper staff were relocated to the testing wing while three XR-37 droid tanks obliterated the building's top floors, which housed accounting and administrative divisions. Arakyd's assault on Viper Tower resolved an 18-month dispute between the two companies, with the former successfully taking over VSIS and keeping it in operation as a research-and-development division. A garrison remained at VSIS headquarters in order to assist with the transition."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Viper Tower was originally created for HoloNet News Vol. 531 50, a HoloNet News article written by Pablo Hidalgo and Paul Ens with illustrations by Joe Corroney and released on April 4, 2002."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
