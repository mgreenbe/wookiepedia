When her son came of age, every adult male Nelvaanian aside Rokrul's shaman, Orvos, had been taken captive by the Techno Union and transformed into cyborgs. Seeing no better time to be a man, Tuzes-Adaz and her son quickly ventured into the forest to perform the manhood initiation ceremony, which was to steal a tail scale of the large and dangerous horax. After finding one, the young boy began the extraction process. However, Anakin Skywalker, while searching for General Grievous on Nelvaan, killed the horax single-handedly, inadvertently interrupting the young Nelvaanian's initiation process."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
