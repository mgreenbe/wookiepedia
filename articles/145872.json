It was based on the Interdictor tactics brilliantly employed by the Grand Admiral to bring reinforcements into his attack on Coruscant and in other battles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It started with a main task force being divided into two. The first group would drop into an enemy system and engage the enemy fleet while the second would jump into a nearby system. When the enemy fleet activated its gravity well projectors, the commander would then order the second fleet to make a micro-jump through hyperspace, usually behind the enemy fleet. Ordinarily, a ship would come out of hyperspace without precise control of where it stopped, requiring it to continue traveling at sublight speeds to reach its intended destination. The advantage of this tactic, then, was that it permitted a fleet to come out of hyperspace at a precise, knowable position."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This tactic was notably used during the Battle of Ciutric against Prince-Admiral Delak Krennel.
