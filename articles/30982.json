Their bodies were wobbly-fleshed and so as a consequence when they traveled they wore exoskeletal travel suits. On their homeworld, they breathed a very thin atmosphere; to simulate this offworld, they used respirators built into their suits. In 2 BBY, a number of Courataines were present on the planet Bonadan at the same time that the smuggler Han Solo was there investigating a slaving ring."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Courataines were created by Brian Daley for his novel Han Solo's Revenge, published by Del Rey in 1979."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
