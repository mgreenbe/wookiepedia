It was a determining body that licensed the use of special battle droids to private owners that were deemed too sophisticated and dangerous for full scale sales. The Devastator war droid developed by Ubrikkian Steamworks was deemed by Republic designates for being such a droid with any individual or organization wanting to purchase them requiring the necessary permit from the Military Arms Regulatory Bureau.
