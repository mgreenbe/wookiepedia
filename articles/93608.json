He was nearly killed when his group was ambushed by a rival gang of mercenaries. He ejected in an escape pod and would have been killed if not for the timely arrival of a patrol of X-wings that drove off the hostiles. Gundeeb felt he had a debt to Korren Starchaser who was leading the patrol, and joined the Rebel alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gundeeb was unusual for a Sullustan in that he was quiet with no sense of humor.
