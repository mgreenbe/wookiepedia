It was also the site of a factory for Lhosan Industries. A filing error removed all record of the planet from astrogation charts and planetary logs, so that years later, people were unsure if \"Wayland\" was the planet's real name or an Imperial codename. The Human colonists quickly came into conflict with Wayland's indigenous sentient species, the \"crystal-skinned\" Myneyrshi and the \"lumpy armor-plated\" Psadans. In their early years, the colonists came to dominate the Myneryrshi and Psadans with Republic technology, but isolated over time, the colonists technologically regressed to the level of the indigenous species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Centuries later, Wayland was rediscovered by Palpatine, perhaps in the pre-Imperial period, who determined its isolation and uncharted nature made it ideal for a storehouse of arcane artifacts and secret technology."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, the Wayland system was restricted by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and a battle claiming the life of a Jedi was fought over the planet at some point."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 BBY, the Empire built a research station.

In 9 ABY, after five years without Imperial contact in the wake of Palpatine's death, the Guardian established a city he populated with Wayland's three native populations: Humans, Myneyrshi, and the Psadan. Joruus C'baoth, an insane clone of the Jedi Master Jorus C'baoth, dueled with the Guardian later that year. The clone killed the Guardian and maintained the settlement himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "C'baoth, hungry for power, established himself as the hand of justice on Wayland, installing a cruel, twisted Jedi code.
