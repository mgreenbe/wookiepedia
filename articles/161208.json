When the Commander, Arn Peralun, and Aryn Leneer returned from their mission to the old Dantooine Jedi Enclave, where they investigated the whereabouts of Darth Malgus, Tesh was one of the Jedi chosen by Master Gnost-Dural to discuss the next moves in rebuilding the Jedi after the war against Zakuul. Gnost-Dural chose to invite him, along with Tau Idair and Sal-Deron to the gathering because Gnost-Dural believed them to be the Order's most important representatives. Tesh protested Leneer's appearance at the meeting, believing that she no longer had the right to participate in the affairs of the Jedi as a former member, but was rebuffed by Peralun and Gnost-Dural. Gnost-Dural assigned Tesh to comb records of the Jedi Enclave to identify what Malgus took from the ruins."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the meeting, Tesh apologized to the Commander for coming off as cold and leaving a bad first impression.

He considered himself slow to trust those he was not already familiar with. Tesh valued the security of the Jedi Order and was paranoid of being betrayed from within, believing it necessary to look out for potential spies within Task Force Nova. He believed this because he blamed the decline of the Jedi Order when the Eternal Empire attacked on help they received from within the Order, and did not want a repeat of this event. Tesh did not get along with those he considered interested in changing the Jedi to something new and those who challenged Tesh's convictions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vinyor Tesh appeared in the 2019 expansion Onslaught to the 2011 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic by the company BioWare.
