Division Three was a CompForce detachment with loose ties to the Bureau, and  waged an aggressive campaign against black marketeers. Under Division Three's scrutiny, small businesses that evaded Imperial bureaucracy were targeted, such as unlicensed food vendors and droid shops. Division Three's methods were unnecessarily violent, with up to seventy percent of individuals arrested needed medical attention. While successful as a campaign against the black market, many of the affected merchants or their families ended up joining the Rebel Alliance. Division Three operatives were either Field Agents or Assault Troopers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Major Tel Trelou worked in Division Three and planned to crack-down on black market activity in the Estaria Central Starport."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
