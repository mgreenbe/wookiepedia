Also referred to as the Clone War, it was named after the army of clone troopers used by the Republic against the Confederacy's battle droid army. With both being fielded in enormous numbers by each respective side, the Grand Army of the Republic and the Separatist Droid Army were two of the largest military forces in galactic history, and fighting between them swept through the galaxy upon the outbreak of war in 22 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to the conflict, Darth Sidious, under his alter ego Sheev Palpatine, had spent years amassing political power, eventually rising to become the Republic's Supreme Chancellor. Through his Sith apprentice Count Dooku, he sparked the Separatist Crisis, causing thousands of Republic star systems to secede and form a new government as the Confederacy, with Dooku as its Head of State. Beginning with the First Battle of Geonosis, the conflict quickly spread throughout the galaxy with both sides scoring significant victories. At different points in the war it seemed that either side was likely to triumph over the other. At the war's outset, both sides vied for control of major hyperspace lanes to gain strategic advantage. That particular struggle ended with a Republic victory when Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, secured an alliance between the Republic and the Hutt Clan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Battles, skirmishes, raids and other actions continued for the next two years, with notable battles occurring on Ryloth, Felucia, Malastare, and Kamino. During this time, the Separatists developed various super weapons, including more traditional weapons such as the ion cannons of the battleship Malevolence, as well as biological weapons such as a variant of the Blue Shadow Virus. Meanwhile, the Republic launched several key offensives, including the Second Battle of Geonosis, which obliterated Geonosis' battle-droid foundries, and a failed Jedi-led operation to capture Supreme Commander of the Droid Army General Grievous at Saleucami. Amidst the escalating conflict, many planets\u2014including Mandalore and other members of the Council of Neutral Systems\u2014struggled to maintain their neutrality, but found it difficult to escape the carnage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over a year into the war, Republic Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Separatist Senator Mina Bonteri collaborated on an initiative to end the fighting. However, their collaboration ended after Dooku and Grievous' bombing of the Republic capital on Coruscant. Later, a peace conference on Mandalore also failed to resolve the conflict. With no end in sight, the Jedi worked with local militaries, including Mon Cala's military and Naboo's Gungan Grand Army, and covertly trained an insurgent rebel cell to retake Onderon from Separatists occupation. Similarly, the Confederacy relied upon factions such as the Umbaran Militia and the Zygerrian Slave Empire. Furthermore, a proxy war materialized when Mother Talzin and her son, the now rogue Sith Lord Maul, strove to exact their revenge on both the Sith and the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the war's third and final year, the Republic drove the Separatists into redoubts within the Outer Rim Territories, initiating a campaign termed the Outer Rim Sieges. In an effort to reverse the course of the war, Grievous launched a massive strike on Coruscant through the Deep Core. Much of the Confederate fleet was lost in the assault, along with Head of State Count Dooku. The Confederacy quickly lost its core leadership in quick succession, with Grievous subsequently falling in battle during the Battle of Utapau, and the Separatist Council being massacred on Mustafar. This, coupled with the issuing of Order 66 and the deactivation of the droid army, led to the total capitulation of the Confederacy and, with it, an end to the war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unbeknownst to most involved, the conflict was instigated, facilitated, and eventually resolved by Darth Sidious, whose ultimate goal was to restore the Sith Empire and to transform the Republic into the Galactic Empire with himself as Emperor, as well as the complete eradication of the Jedi Order. Evading arrest by Mace Windu and a cadre of Jedi, Sidious would succeed in this endeavor with the aid of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who Sidious seduced to the dark side of the Force and molded into his new apprentice Darth Vader. Sidious publicly branded the Jedi as traitors and triggered Order 66, which forced the Republic's clone troopers to betray and execute their Jedi Generals, thereby initiating a galaxy-wide Great Jedi Purge. Palpatine then declared an end to the Clone Wars in an extraordinary session of the Senate and proclaimed the transformation of the Republic into the First Galactic Empire, and the Galactic Senate into the Imperial Senate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A millennium-old vendetta"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The origins of the Clone Wars dated back to the time of the Old Republic, which reigned over a millennium prior to the war. That era marked a dark age in galactic history, as the Sith battled their ancient enemies, the Jedi, for control of the galaxy. The Sith suffered from infighting, which ultimately led to their defeat, but although the Jedi believed they had vanquished their foes, the Sith had merely retreated into hiding. Darth Bane, the last surviving Dark Lord of the Sith, founded a philosophy known as the Rule of Two, which dictated that the entire Sith Order would be comprised solely of a master and an apprentice. Operating in the shadows, the Sith accumulated power and influence in preparation for the endgame of their grand plan: galactic domination and revenge against the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From the remnants of the Old Republic, a modern Galactic Republic was formed. For the first time, a Galactic Senate afforded political representation to hundreds of worlds and star systems. The Old Republic's armed forces were disbanded, leading the Jedi Order to assume a peacekeeping role within the Republic, serving at the behest of the Senate and its Supreme Chancellor. Over time, the Senate incurred notoriety for its stagnant bureaucracy and corruption, and rifts emerged as the central Core Worlds\u2014including the Republic's capital, Coruscant\u2014became reputed for their willingness to exploit the resources of the outlying Outer Rim Territories. Adding to the morass of bureaucracy and inaction was the fact that corporate blocs such as the Trade Federation, the InterGalactic Banking Clan, and the Techno Union were granted Senate representation alongside the Republic's member worlds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nearly a thousand years into the Republic's reign, Darth Sidious became the ruling Dark Lord of the Sith. Using his alter ego of Senator Sheev Palpatine of Naboo, he devised a complex scheme to unseat the incumbent Supreme Chancellor, Finis Valorum, and install himself as the Republic's next head of state: as the Republic became embroiled in a dispute over the taxation of trade routes, Sidious secretly allied himself with Nute Gunray, the Viceroy of the Trade Federation, and ordered the Trade Federation to blockade his homeworld of Naboo. When the Senate's characteristic stagnation proved ineffectual at overturning the Invasion of Naboo, Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo called for a Vote of No Confidence in Valorum's leadership. The Senate thereafter elected Palpatine as Valorum's successor, and the Jedi Order aided the Royal Naboo Security Forces in ending the blockade, though not before the Sith revealed themselves in the form of Darth Maul, Sidious' current apprentice. Maul was defeated by the Jedi Knights and presumed dead, leading the Jedi High Council to suspect the existence of a second Sith Lord. Now the Supreme Chancellor, Palpatine was seen as a crusading reformer in the face of the Republic's failings. Additionally, thanks to the Invasion of Naboo, Palpatine was able to vilify galactic corporations, which helped lead to the Separatist government. Though an open war was still ten years away, the fight for Naboo had served as the first spark of the Clone Wars in a number of ways."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The creation of the clone army"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sidious found a replacement for Maul in Count Dooku, a former Jedi Master who had left the Order and become integral to the Sith plan for galactic conquest. Sidious and Dooku, the latter of whom adopted the name Darth Tyranus, plotted to manipulate the Republic into a sham war with an opposing state. The Jedi would be forced to serve as generals for a Republic army of soldiers, who would eventually serve as their executioners. Furthermore, the conflict would destabilize the Republic and render it vulnerable to the Sith takeover."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to the Invasion of Naboo, the Jedi High Council dismissed one of its members, Master Sifo-Dyas, due to his unorthodox belief that the Republic would need to raise an army for a full-scale conflict that he had foreseen. Undeterred, Sifo-Dyas contacted the Kaminoans, a species reputed for its cloning industry, and ordered the production of a clone army on behalf of the Republic. In so doing, Sifo-Dyas circumvented both the Senate and the High Council, purporting to have the support of the former. When the Sith discovered the existence of the clone army, they went to extreme lengths to hijack the project. At the time, then-Chancellor Valorum asked Sifo-Dyas to oversee confidential negotiations between the Republic and the Pyke Syndicate, a rising spice cartel that had begun to dominate the Coruscant Underworld. Unaware of Valorum's request, the High Council separately dispatched Sifo-Dyas to resolve a tribal dispute on the planet Felucia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sifo-Dyas never reached Felucia, and the resulting events became enmeshed in a web of subterfuge that took the Jedi Order many years to unravel. Dooku, as Tyranus, hired the Pykes to assassinate his old friend Sifo-Dyas, and his T-6 shuttle was subsequently shot down over the moon of their homeworld Oba Diah, killing Sifo-Dyas in the crash, while Valorum's personal attach\u00e9 Silman, who had accompanied him on the mission, survived the attack. The Pykes delivered Sifo-Dyas's corpse to Tyranus, but covertly kept Silman hostage as potential leverage in the future. The Jedi Order, meanwhile, believed Sifo-Dyas to have died on Felucia after he failed to negotiate peace between the local tribes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After seizing control of the cloning project, the Sith selected the renowned bounty hunter Jango Fett as the genetic template for their army. Chief Medical Scientist Nala Se served as one of the project's main engineers. On the Kaminoan homeworld of Kamino, Fett provided both genetic samples and training for his so-called clone troopers, who were subjected to growth acceleration and thereby aged at twice the normal rate of humans. As a result, the first generation of troops was ready within a decade of Sifo-Dyas's original order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Implanted within each clone's brain was a structural inhibitor chip that was the key to the Sith's revenge against the Jedi. The Kaminoan scientists believed the chips were designed to preclude aggression within each subject, and that Sifo-Dyas had ordered the installation of the chips as a countermeasure against betrayal from rogue Jedi. In truth, the chips would force each clone to comply with Protocol 66, a directive for the soldiers to execute their Jedi commanders. Thus, the Sith would be able to massacre the entire Jedi Order via its subordinate soldiers."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Separatist Crisis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eight years after the Invasion of Naboo, a pan-galactic Confederacy of Independent Systems began to take shape when Count Dooku commandeered a HoloNet relay station in the Raxus system and berated the Republic with condemning rhetoric. Over the next two years, a Separatist Crisis arose when thousands of star systems seceded from the Republic and flocked to the Confederacy. The Separatist Crisis sent the Republic into a frenzy, particularly as Dooku repeatedly spurned Palpatine's public requests for negotiation. The Republic Senate soon became divided over the passage of a Military Creation Act. Advocates of the bill argued that the Republic required a military force to defend itself from the Separatists, whereas others such as now-Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala believed that the measure would provoke full-scale civil war between the Republic and the Confederacy. Such a war became increasingly inevitable, with the Sith Lords poised to lead both sides of the approaching conflict that would tear the galaxy asunder."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 22 BBY, the Sith had nearly completed preparations for open conflict between the Republic and the Confederacy. Nominally the Confederacy functioned as a democracy, and delegates from its myriad member worlds formed a Separatist Senate. At the same time, the galaxy's major corporations pledged their support and resources to the Confederacy, and their leaders thereby earned seats on Dooku's Separatist Council. Its members included Chairman San Hill of the InterGalactic Banking Clan, Foreman Wat Tambor of the Techno Union, Magistrate Passel Argente of the Corporate Alliance, Presidente Shu Mai of the Commerce Guild, and Archduke Poggle the Lesser of the Geonosian hives, as well as Senators Po Nudo of Ando and Tikkes of Mon Cala."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nute Gunray's condition for joining the Separatist Council was that Amidala be killed in revenge for her humiliating defeat of him at the Battle of Naboo. Jango Fett and his associate, Zam Wesell, undertook the bounty that Gunray subsequently issued on Amidala. Just before the Senate's vote on the Military Creation Act, Wesell mounted an unsuccessful attempt on Amidala's life, resulting in the High Council designating Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan, Anakin Skywalker\u2014both of whom had been instrumental in the Republic's victory at the Battle of Naboo\u2014as Amidala's personal bodyguards. Wesell's second attempt on Amidala's life similarly failed, and Fett used a Kamino saberdart to execute Wesell before Kenobi and Skywalker could extract information from her. Nevertheless, Kenobi identified the saberdart's connection to Kamino, and was alarmed when his research revealed that the planet had been erased from the Jedi Archives. Without the help of Grand Master Yoda he pinpointed Kamino's location above the galactic plane, just south of the Rishi Maze, and traveled there as part of his investigation into Amidala's assailant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Kenobi arrived at Kamino's capital of Tipoca City, Prime Minister Lama Su greeted him and revealed the existence of the clone army. By this time, 200,000 troopers were ready for deployment, with a million more soldiers nearing completion of their training. A shocked Kenobi reported his discovery to the High Council, which ordered him to detain Fett and bring him to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant for questioning. Fett escaped from Tipoca City with his son, an unaltered clone whom he named Boba, and fled to the Confederate capital of Geonosis. Kenobi tracked the Fetts and, after engaging in a starfighter dogfight that led them to believe him dead, followed them to the planetary surface. There, he discovered that the Geonosians were manufacturing millions of battle droids in their droid foundries. He also witnessed a meeting between Dooku and the Separatist Council, discovering that they were preparing to merge their resources into a Separatist Droid Army.

While Kenobi was in his custody, Dooku claimed that the entire Republic was under the sway of a Dark Lord of the Sith named Darth Sidious, and tried to persuade Kenobi to help him destroy the Sith.

Though Palpatine promised to relinquish his emergency powers once the crisis had passed, that was never to be the case. While Master Yoda traveled to Kamino to marshal the clone troopers for the Grand Army, Master Mace Windu assembled an assault team of 212 Jedi, drawn from the Masters of the High Council and the Order's ranks of Knights and Padawans, to save Kenobi from imprisonment on Geonosis.

During the ensuing ground battle, Council member Coleman Trebor came within seconds of ending the conflict when he nearly managed to kill Dooku, but Jango Fett gunned him down before he could do so. Windu thereafter beheaded Fett, an act that would earn him the ire of his son, Boba. Within a short span, only Amidala, Kenobi, Skywalker, Windu, and a fraction of their Jedi allies were still standing.

Overwhelmed by the Republic's assault, Dooku and the Separatist Council ordered a retreat. Poggle the Lesser entrusted Dooku with the Geonosians' plans to the Ultimate Weapon, and Dooku headed for a remote hangar where his Punworcca 116-class interstellar sloop was docked.

Skywalker agreed to the alliance, hoping the Ascendancy he now knew of may become an ally to the Republic. While Skywalker elected to fly down to Batuu in his Eta-2, Thrawn elected to take a shuttle to lead the way to the Nubian's location, as he ordered Che'ri to take their ship back to the Mokivj system so that, when he arrived, she could fly down to retrieve the shield generator. He ordered her to use as many decoys as needed to keep the droid starfighters away once he signaled her. Upon landing, after he fought a group of smugglers who had found the ship, Skywalker investigated the Nubian while Thrawn and R2 remained outside to search for clues. All three then departed for Black Spire Outpost aboard Thrawn's shuttle."}, {"tag": "h5", "text": "Mission to Mokivj"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In time, Skywalker and Thrawn learned of the smuggling operation for Mokivj, which they learned was under the command of Solha, and that a ring of thieves was stealing from the operation. Before leaving Batuu, Skywalker informed Thrawn about Dooku, Grievous, and Palpatine, and Thrawn advised him to remember that, in war, his goal should remain victory instead of revenge. On Mokivj, Amidala, having crashed landed the Possibility after being attacked by a vulture droid, bribed three locals named Cimy, Huga, and LebJau to keep her presence a secret, and Thrawn, Skywalker, and R2 landed at the Separatist factory with the captured CIS freighter Larkrer, initially pretending to be its crew before they were captured. The Chiss and Jedi ultimately escaped their improvised cells. Joined by Huga and Cimy, Amidala, who had witnessed the arrest of her husband and his allies, and her allies disguised themselves as maintenance workers to head to the detention block, with the Senator taking out two B1 battle droids guarding it. Upon entering, she united with Skywalker and Thrawn. As Skywalker served as a distraction, Amidala and Thrawn journeyed to retrieve the Jedi's lightsaber, and Amidala also convinced Lebjau to evacuate the workers for their plan to destroy the factory. Skywalker found himself in the assembly line.

While Amidala protested the idea of him leaving, Thrawn remained steadfast in his commitment to the Chiss and additionally asked why the Republic had not allowed the Confederacy to secede peacefully. After she stated the Confederacy had attacked first, Thrawn advised her to use the south end's door before she was out of his sight. However, Thrawn made sure to return to helping shortly afterward, wielding a lightning gun to help take down the cortosis B2s. He also explained what the metal, which Skywalker had realized\u2014in his battle against the droids\u2014could resist lightsaber strikes, was and how it was rare. Additionally, the team elected to discover what the northern wing of the factory was producing. After R2 worked to reprogram the B2 factory, Amidala was confronted by Solha, while Skywalker and Thrawn uncovered the north wing was producing cortosis-weaved clone armor; Skywalker quickly assumed Dooku was planning a mass-Serennian infiltration of the clone army as a surprise attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Amidala knocked out Sophla, Skywalker ensured the factory was destroyed, yet he also sought to destroy the Cortosis mine. Thrawn confided to Amidala that he believed the Jedi General's plan was reckless, arguing that it would be better for the CIS to waste resources on Mokivj than to make them to look elsewhere. Although she agreed, the Senator understood that her husband could not be talked out of his plan, even though Thrawn warned her it could be a threat to Mokivj. He also declined her offer to return to Coruscant with them to create a more formal Chiss\u2014Republic alliance, stating he had other duties to attend to and that he was not tasked with such a role. Before departing, Thrawn also advised them that the clone armor may have not been intended for an infiltration, as such operations had a high risk of failing. Although Skywalker was certain that they did not need to worry about the plan, the Chiss officer disagreed. Skywalker's plan to collapse the mining tunnels would indeed have unintended consequences; as he, Amidala, and LebJau, who had asked to leave with them to start a new life on Batuu, watched from their ship, the cortosis redirected the explosives' heat, causing a catastrophe that, despite not moving towards the people of Mokivj, would devastate the environment of the world.

This campaign, called the Outer Rim Sieges, would result in most of the Republic's Jedi and military forces fighting on these outer worlds.
