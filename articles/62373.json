It was similar in appearance to other Rakatan temples, such as the Temple of the Ancients on Lehon. The native Noghri were said to remember the Rakata only as gods, and protected the temple with their lives. It served as neutral ground for the planet's various clans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, the Noghri used the temple to store the Scientific Instrument Package they salvaged from the wreckage of the Gahenna. They stashed the SIP in a chamber protected by poison hyperdarts. Jedi General Rii'ke En attempted to infiltrate the temple, but he and his clone trooper were killed by its protectors. Aayla Secura and CC-5052 later finished En's mission\u2014with dubious help from Quinlan Vos\u2014and absconded with the SIP after thwarting the temple's assault droids and overcoming its defenses."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
