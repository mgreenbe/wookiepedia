Teaming up with the slicer Cian Shee, Farnmir enjoyed relative success in her new profession. Together, they were able to claim the bounty for Disciples of Psusan leader Scri Oscuro's capture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Zealots of Psusan planned revenge, and were able to sway Shee to work with them to kill Farnmir. When Farnmir learned of this, she invited Shee to the Outlander Club on Coruscant, a place known to be popular amongst the Psusan. She gleaned intelligence from Zealot Nyrat Agira, confirming her suspicions about Shee. Confronting Shee, Farnmir tried to apprehend her, but her former partner was too fast. Shee subsequently called off the deal with Oscuro and the Psusan, and Farnmir resumed her life as a bounty hunter. She disagreed with the views of Palpatine's New Order, and worked for the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. Eventually, she came across Shee again on Nar Shaddaa. There, Farnmir killed her former partner in single combat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Kuati Security Forces"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Raised on Kuat, Kalyn Farnmir joined the Kuati Security Forces: a group charged with keeping the peace in the rich and aristocratic Kuat system. Unfortunately for Farnmir, she was set up by corrupt officials from Kuat Drive Yards as the illegal seller of corporate secrets to Neimoidian agents. The officials were the ones who had been selling the secrets, but they needed a non-entity to take the blame. As a result, she was dishonorably discharged from the Security Forces, and left unemployed. Despite the setback, her desire to bring criminals to justice persisted, and as such, she became a bounty hunter."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Bounty hunter"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Donning body armor and obtaining a silver-plated blaster, Farnmir decided that she would need a partner in her new profession, and so enlisted the skills of the slicer Cian Shee. The two enjoyed relative success, hunting down small time criminals and corporate frauds. Eventually, they were hired to bring down High Priest Scri Oscuro, leader of the Disciples of Psusan. Oscuro had been using the church of Psusan as a front for unsavory activities. While they were able to apprehend Oscuro, they incurred the wrath of the Zealots of Psusan."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Betrayal and confrontation at the Outlander Club"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY,[source?] an informant of Farnmir's told her that the Psusan were plotting revenge for Oscuro's arrest. Farnmir also learned that Shee had sold out, and was in on the Psusan plot. Shee was also to receive a substantial fee from the Psusans for setting Farnmir up. Shocked, Farnmir resolved to learn the truth behind the accusation, and arranged to meet Shee in the Outlander Club, on Coruscant. The club was a known nexus of Psusan activity, but Farnmir claimed to Shee that it was merely a business meeting. Arriving early, she recognized the cult tattoo of a Psusan Zealot on Nyrat Agira, and subsequently questioned her. Agira confirmed that Oscuro was present on Coruscant and had made dealings with Shee."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Shee arrived, Farnmir greeted her as though nothing was wrong, so as to uncover the truth and depth of the betrayal. Watching as Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi apprehended bounty hunter Zam Wesell nearby, she strengthened her resolve, and prepared to confront Shee. As the two bounty hunters made to leave the club, Farnmir attempted to pin Shee with a hold, but the slicer was too agile. She escaped into the night, as far away from Farnmir as possible."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Civil War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shee called off the deal with Oscuro, due to the fact that Farnmir was now ready and prepared for any ambush. Eventually, Farnmir started working jobs for the Alliance to Restore the Republic, as she had no love for Palpatine's Galactic Empire. Shee conversely worked for the Imperials. In her work, the slicer was called upon to eliminate her former partner. Farnmir and Shee met on Nar Shaddaa, and fought to the death, with Farnmir emerging the victor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kalyn Farnmir was highly adept at bringing felons to justice. Though she was not able to save herself from the machinations of scheming Kuati businesspeople, she was able to fall on her feet, and use her skills acquired in her former job to best serve her. As a bounty hunter, she was mildly successful, and her marks were usually criminals themselves. She was shocked upon learning that her partner, Cian Shee, had betrayed her, and continued to seek confirmation on the matter after her initial discovery. She did not shy away from killing her former friend, however, in the name of justice. Farnmir could cut an imposing figure when she wanted to, and could intimidate and interrogate to great effect."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kalyn Farnmir first appeared in George Lucas' Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, where she is seen in the \"Outlander Club\" scene. Her character was elaborated on by Daniel Wallace in the Star Wars Insider article Who's Who in the Outlander Club: It's Ladies' Night. Pablo Hidalgo named the character, with \"Kalyn Farnmir\" being an anagram of Mary Franklin, the events manager at Lucasfilm Ltd. The character's backstory was further fleshed out by Benjamin Christopher Norton Dawe through the StarWars.com Hyperspace feature, \"What's The Story?\" Dawe specifically chose Kuat as Farnmir's homeworld due to the fact that he didn't believe many characters from the Expanded Universe hailed from there. Due to that particular choice, he tied Farnmir's story into Kuat Drive Yards, an Expanded Universe company that had originated in 1989's Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dawe deduced that Farnmir's progression from Kuat Drive Yards to bounty hunting would have to have taken place between Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace and Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, and so he decided to use the Neimoidians, who had been featured prominently in the former, in his story. Dawe also used the character of Cian Shee, who Farnmir is seen embracing in Attack of the Clones, as a prominent character in his entry. Originally, Dawe had identified Farnmir's informant as a Kubaz, but the reference was cut by StarWars.com. Another previously established element from the Expanded Universe that Dawe used were the Zealots of Psusan, first mentioned in Underworld: The Yavin Vassilika. The Databank entry was later used, almost verbatim, in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
