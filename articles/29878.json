Corellian Colonizers were considered to be the pride of the Exploration Corps and at one point the Jedi operated thirteen of them. However, many were lost during the New Sith Wars and following the end of the conflict, only three remained: the Beneficia, the Luminosity and the Silikan Stillness. The three surviving ships were used to carry out regular patrols of the Core Worlds, the Rim Worlds and the edges of Wild Space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
