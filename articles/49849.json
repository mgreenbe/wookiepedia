It allowed a member of the Mind Walkers to sustain themselves with nothing but the essence of the Force. The forsaking Jedi Knight Qwallo Mode used this technique to fire a missile launcher at the Jade Shadow, without wearing a helmet, while floating in the vacuum of space. The technique's power could be amplified through the exercises of Mind Walking, as evidenced by Rhondi and Rolund Tremaine's combined usage of these Force powers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
