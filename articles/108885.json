Q-7N was forgotten, however, and thus he guarded the temple storing the treasure for two thousand years. In 0 ABY, he was encountered by a Rebel, who was attempting to eliminate Imperial activity surrounding the temple.

Returning home, he found his fellow mining droids eliminated, and then was called to help investigate the attempted Imperial theft of the freighter Stellar Manx. Following a journey to Kwenn Space Station and Bonadan in turn, he found himself back on Malagarr, where Frap Radicon was planning to develop new gravity well projector technology.

The Malagarrians had already mined the planet of all natural resources, polluting it in the process. In need of power, they had droids mine the planet's core, and turn the entire world into a giant reactor. Within weeks of construction, millions of Malagarrians perished from the radioactivity, and the survivors built underground installations to survive.

The Massassi eventually died out, but around 2000 BBY, a group of pirates built their own fortress, in much the same style as that of the Massassi, and used it to store the treasure they had amassed in their travels. Q-7N's security skills were called upon to guard both the temples and the pirates who used them for shelter. Eventually, they either departed or died, and Q-7N would go undisturbed for two millennia.

In the first few days of the year 0 ABY, Yavin Four suffered an incursion from the Galactic Empire. Captain Skeezer had been dispatched by Admiral Termo to investigate the aftermath of the Battle of Yavin. Skeezer's task force had been forced to land their Carrack-class light cruiser near Q-7N's temple following an attack by Captain Han Solo of the Millennium Falcon.

The Rebel was able to infiltrate Skeezer's makeshift camp, but their cover was blown, and they were forced to enter Q-7N's temple. The Rebel bypassed Q-7N's makeshift battle droids, and made his way to the temple's main chamber. There, Q-7N scanned his image, and confronted him, demanding to know the Rebel's intent. Q-7N was suspicious, as the Rebel bore the white armor of the recent arrivals. When the Rebel referred to his \"friends,\" Q-7N assumed he was in fact aiding the Imperial invaders, and used a trap door to drop him into a pit of treasure. There, Q-7N projected the illusion of two Imperial stormtroopers, and gauged the Rebel's reaction. When he shot the two \"troops\" for stealing, Q-7N understood his intent was different to that of Skeezer, and decided that the treasure was safe for the time being."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After two thousand years, Q-7N had grown tired of Yavin 4. He sought to see the outside world, and the surrounding galaxy, and so requested that the Rebel take him along with him. The Rebel agreed, provided that Q-7N stay close and out of trouble. Watching as the Rebel battled stormtroopers, Q-7N offered to help, activating a nearby battle droid and programming it to attack the Imperials. However, after several paces, the droid collapsed and disintegrated, alerting the Imperials to the Rebel's presence. The Rebel and Q-7N were able to find cover, but the diminutive droid was very apologetic. Blasting his way out of the camp, the Rebel retrieved the speeder bike he had used to reach Skeezer's camp, and attempted to escape, with Q-7N in tow. Skeezer and his troops, however, gave chase, while the Rebel was forced to make a stand. When he was knocked off his speeder bike by blaster fire, Skeezer closed in for the kill, but Q-7N quickly flew at the Imperial captain's hand, disarming him. However, the stormtroopers opened fire on the droid, severely damaging him. The Rebel eventually incapacitated all the troopers, and Skeezer was taken into Alliance custody. Q-7N's chassis was retrieved, and taken back to the Great Temple.

Solo, Organa, Chewbacca, Luke Skywalker, C-3PO, and R2-D2 all set out for Thyferra, where bacta was developed, on the Millennium Falcon. R2-D2 brought along the damaged Q-7N, and finished repairing him while the Falcon was in transit.

Setting down in Docking Bay 72, Q-7N was excited about working for the Alliance, and relished the opportunity to investigate the bacta scandal.

Q-7N was able to avoid notice by keeping by everyone's feet, before ducking into a small hole."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the Rebels managed to free himself, and Q-7N joined the escapee. Due to his knowledge of the labyrinthine temples of Yavin Four, Q-7N was confident he could help the Rebel escape the Imperial compound. However, his \"shortcut\" caused the Rebel to encounter a group of technicians. While the Rebel was amused by Q-7N's choice of exit, the droid was indignant, claiming that he could not have detected the existence of the Humans. The Rebel made his way to Docking Bay 72, where a stormtrooper discovered that the Falcon may be of interest to Grand Moff Tarkin. News of the Death Star's destruction had not reached Thyferra, and so the Rebel quickly dispatched the trooper and retrieved his datapad. This, however, attracted the attention of the other stormtroopers, forcing Q-7N to find a new method of escape. The small droid lead the Rebel up to the rooftops of the docking bay, and showed him to the Y-wing that had been left earlier."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebel sought only to distance himself from the Imperials, however, and set the Y-wing down nearby.

Unbeknownst to the pair, the cantina was actually the Plastoid Pitt. Q-7N waited outside, while the Rebel ventured in, but eventually threw caution to the wind when he heard the Rebel yell. He discovered his friend standing over the body of a Gamorrean, and the Rebel explained that people were lured into the cantina, captured, and sold for slave labor. Deciding that the cantina was certainly not Morbo's Place, the pair ventured through the underground chambers of the cantina, fighting off guards and avoiding traps."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After defeating an abrasive Brubb, the pair ventured into a hidden stockroom. Sending a pair of Rodian guards tumbling into a vat, the Rebel encountered Plurra, a Vratix slave.

Plurra explained that he made bacta in the warehouse, and after the Rebel defeated the healed Rodians, the Vratix showed him and Q-7N the way out. The Rebel, however, barged straight back into the Plastoid Pitt, and interrogated the Devaronian owner as to the real location of Morbo's Place. Plurra then offered to help the Rebel in liberating his friends, and Q-7N led them back to Docking Bay 72."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebel decided that he needed to get back to the room with the technicians in order to save his friends.

Defeating the Imperial TIE Fighter patrol guarding the city, the Rebel flew up the side of the mountain on top of which Delrakkin City was located. Battling through the Imperial defenses, and breaking through Delrakkin's cloud cover, the pair were given a full view of the high-altitude city, and witnessed the Imperial X-wings razing their own buildings to the ground.

Q-7N detected that the Imperials had then chosen to land, and were proceeding on foot. After the Rebel defeated one of the pilots, Q-7N spotted a cave, and the pair journeyed in. As the cave got darker, one of Q-7N's mining utilities, a set of high-powered lights, came to good use. The pair eventually encountered a group of native Delrakkins, who had been forced out of their homes in Delrakkin City by the Empire in years prior.

The Rebel explained the ruse, but one of the Imperial pilots entered the cave. The Rebel dispatched the pilot, and bade the Delrakkins go warn the others that he might be leaving Delrakkin to investigate the Imperial presence.

Meanwhile, the pair ventured through the capital ship, searching for clues about the bacta scandal. They made it to Admiral Termo's quarters, and stole a pair of holotapes from his safe. Hurriedly escaping the ship in their X-wing, the pair were attacked by TIE Fighters.

Termo had apparently viewed the tape, attacked the city, and was awaiting the Death Star's arrival, complete with the contaminated bacta supply. The contaminated bacta was then to be used on the survivors of the attack, killing them, and leaving Delrakkin vacant for gravity well experiments. Rebel X-wings were used to discredit the Rebellion and cast them as terrorists in the eyes of the galactic community. The most alarming fact to the group, however, was that Tarkin ordered Termo to go to the Yavin system should the Death Star not arrive on schedule.
