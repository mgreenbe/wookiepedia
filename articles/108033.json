They successfully exposed non-native wildlife to the Nightmare Lands, but succumbed to the effects themselves; as the team's research was crucial to ongoing Imperial operations in hazardous environments on Aaris III and Sebiris, the Science Bureau issued a bounty asking for the retrieval of the team's data."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
