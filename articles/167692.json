During the Imperial Era, when the galaxy was dominated by the Galactic Empire, and prior to the Battle of Hoth in the year 3 ABY, a campaign occurred on Zaloriis between the Zalorians and the Empire, involving a revolt there. The human male Maximilian Veers demonstrated his cunning and courage in the campaign, and won it for the Empire with the use of new tactics he developed.
