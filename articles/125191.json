When the Clone Wars erupted across the galaxy, Forte took up the rank of General within the Grand Army of the Republic and fought valiantly against the Separatist Droid Army. At the end of the war, the rise of the Galactic Empire and the beginning of the Galactic Empire saw Forte deemed a fugitive and on the run. In 19 BBY, Forte confronted Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader and was slain on Kashyyyk."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like most of his peers, Siadem Forte was most likely discovered to be Force-sensitive on his homeworld and turned over to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant for training in the ways of the Force. Entering into the academy there, Forte eventually graduated and was selected by a Master for an apprenticeship. After years of study as a Padawan, Forte passed his Trials of Knighthood and was made a Knight by the Jedi High Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A short, thick-bodied man, Forte eventually went on to selected the Togruta Deran Nalual as his Padawan. Traveling the galaxy together, the duo was recalled to the Coruscant Temple at the outbreak of the Clone Wars where Forte accepted the rank of General within the newly created Grand Army of the Republic to combat the Confederacy of Independent Systems' Droid Army. Fighting side-by-side with clone troopers over the course of the three years of war, Forte and Nalual were caught unaware when the Republic crumbled and its Supreme Chancellor issued Contingency Order 66 to the Grand Army, ordering them to kill their Jedi compatriots. Able to kill their clones before they were overrun, Forte issued Emergency Code Nine Thirteen from his personal Jedi beacon on Dellalt and waited in hiding for responders. When eight other Jedi arrived, Forte took the lead as he was the oldest and lead the group in the hijacking a SX troop shuttle. Fleeing the planet, the group was harried by ARC-170s and a light cruiser, which saw the death of two of the Jedi crew. Limping through space, the group met up with the Drunk Dancer and were given sanctuary by its captain, Jula Shryne."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Traveling aboard Shryne's ship, the group was eventually enlarged with the arrival of Padawan Olee Starstone and her adopted Master, Roan Shryne. After a drawn out discussion as to what to do, Starstone encouraged the Jedi to go to Kashyyyk in order to find Grand Master Yoda. After arriving and speaking with the Wookiee chieftains there, the world was attacked by Sith Lord Darth Vader, who was hunting the fugitive Jedi. Paired with Knight Iwo Kulka, Forte and the Ho'Din attacked together but were no match for Vader. After receiving a strike to the shoulder and thigh, Forte and Kulka were both decapitated by Vader as they attempted to rise to attack. While Master Shryne attempted to strike Vader down with Forte's sapphire lightsaber, the weapon did not guide its new master to victory either. While his Padawan and several other of his comrades escaped, Forte's memory was further slandered when images of his body were used as anti-Jedi propaganda on the HoloNet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
