Darja warns them to stay away from her granddaughter, but the Seventh Sister approaches and coldly assures her they only wish to make friends with Alora \u2013 but first there is some business to attend to, as the Fifth Brother ignites his lightsaber and sets the blades spinning, throwing it down the corridor at the ship's passengers."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Tailing the Inquisitors"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile on Garel, Ahsoka Tano pays Kanan Jarrus a visit with Jedi business to discuss. They decide to have the discussion in private, and board the Ghost. Once aboard and alone in Jarrus' quarters, Tano briefs Jarrus on her recent investigation about the Sith Lord, and so far the information she seeks eludes her. She has also learned more about the Inquisitors, and reveals they have a secondary mission to make retrievals. Tano managed to decode two sets of coordinates, and while she investigates the first one, she wants Jarrus to investigate the second. Jarrus accepts the mission, and so does Ezra Bridger, who had been listening in on the conversation. Bridger, Jarrus, Garazeb Orrelios and Chopper depart from Garel and arrive on the planet Takobo, with a mission to find and retrieve whatever the Inquisitors are after before they do."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After landing in the city, the rebels take a look at the coordinates they were given, which turns out to be housing units. Jarrus orders Orrelios and Chopper to investigate the spaceports for any ship belonging to the Inquisitors, while he and Bridger check out the apartments. With everyone in agreement as to their assignments, the rebels head out in opposite directions. Meanwhile, Tano arrives at the other coordinates, and finds the ship the Inquisitors attacked earlier adrift in space. Once aboard, she finds the ship severely damaged and deserted. However, she does find Darja alive. Tano learns from her that the Inquisitors took her granddaughter, and Darja asks the ex-Jedi to find her.

But their long search finally pays off after they find two Advance TIE fighters under guard by one of the Seventh Sister's probe droids. Orrelios shoots it down, and the two enter the bay intending to destroy the ships. However, before they can begin planting explosives they discover Alora in one of the cockpits. Meanwhile, Jarrus and Bridger arrive at the apartment they are looking for and find the place ransacked, and an injured female Ithorian known as Oora. She tells them the Inquisitors came looking for her child, Pypey, but she managed to send him away with a droid before they could get to him. Bridger and Jarrus promise Oora they will find Pypey before the Inquisitors do, and soon head out on their search.

He sends the droid to go a separate way to serve as a decoy for the Inquisitors, but Orrelios doesn't get very far. The Inquisitors show up and take out the droid, but don't find Pypey.

The Inquisitors lose sight of Orrelios, but the Fifth Brother senses Pypey's fear within the building they were hiding in.

Bridger and Jarrus soon reach the apartment building as well, but immediately hide themselves after Bridger spots the probe droid.

Bridger tries to calm him down, but it is no use. Through the Force, the Inquisitors sense Pypey's fear, and find the apartment where the rebels were hiding him. They try to spike them out with their lightsabers, but Bridger and Jarrus cut an entrance to the next apartment above them. They escape and make a run for the stairs. Bridger still hasn't managed to calm Pypey down, mainly because he can sense his fear through the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jarrus finally understands why the Inquisitors are abducting these children, because they are Force-sensitive.

Meanwhile, the Inquisitors are still roaming the corridors for the rebels. The Fifth Brother uses the Force to find them, and when he senses Pypey and Bridger in the ventilation, he uses his lightsaber to spike them.

Meanwhile, both Inquisitors quickly overpower their opponents, forcing Jarrus and Orrelios to retreat. They jump out of a window and land on a passing speeder. The Inquisitors jump onto another speeder, throw out the driver, and pursue Jarrus and Orrelios through the city streets. Jarrus shoots at the Inquisitors and takes out their speeder.

Suddenly and unexpectedly, before the Inquisitors can take Pypey, Tano emerges from the spaceport, ready to fight the Inquisitors. She tells her fellow rebels to get on board the Phantom, as she engages the Inquisitors in a duel. Despite their best efforts, it is obvious that they cannot hope to compare to Ahsoka, who manages to easily overpower the both of them. She effortlessly takes out the Fifth Brother twice and then turns her attention to the Seventh Sister. Finished playing around with her, Ahsoka turns off her own lightsabers and takes a meditative stance. Seeing an opportunity, the Seventh Sister tries to attack her, but Ahsoka catches the Seventh Sister's lightsaber hilt with her bare hands and then uses the Force to turn the blades off, leaving the Seventh Sister in absolute disbelief. Ahsoka then Force pushes her into a pillar, defeating her. However, her victory is short-lived as Imperial reinforcements arrive and surround her. However, as the Phantom takes off, Tano smirks and then uses the Force to jump aboard the ship and escape capture.

Just then, the Seventh Sister's probe droid shows up with some information that it caught when it spotted Ezra. Recorded in Ezra's own words, the Inquisitors learn that the Rebels are hiding on Garel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The domes and steeples seen on many of the buildings in Takobo City, which is heavily featured in this episode of Star Wars Rebels, resemble that of real-life traditional Eastern Orthodox architecture found in Russia and some of its neighboring countries; likewise, the pattern seen several times on Takobo and used by some of its inhabitants (such as the one that Alora is swaddled in) bears a strong resemblance to the folkloristic designs often found on embroidery and regional costumes in Poland and Belarus. These facts, combined with the tower block laden landscape of Hammertown akin to the cities of Ukraine and other Eastern European countries, suggest that the planet of Takobo was heavily inspired by aesthetics of the Slavonic nations. Its climate also seems to resemble the Siberian tundra."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
