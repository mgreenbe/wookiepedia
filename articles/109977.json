Created from an older model of astromech droid manufactured by Industrial Automaton, they featured black plating, a red photoreceptor, and a grasping arm. Among the improvised equipment that could be found in his shop in Tatooine's port city of Mos Espa, the Toydarian junk dealer Watto owned an R1-type shopkeeping drone that handled most of the routine business operations of his parts dealership. The droid's dome was marked with a handprint, and it was pictured in a HoloNews advertisement for Watto's shop as an example of the droids available at the dealership."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The R1-type shopkeeping drone first appeared in the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.
