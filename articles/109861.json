Although the newly established Galactic Empire rejected mass production of the craft, the prototypes ended up serving in the planetary defense forces of Tammuz-an. Eventually, the Alliance to Restore the Republic procured several Tammuz-an R-22s and modified them into what they dubbed the RZ-1 A-wing interceptor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kuat Systems Engineering R-22 starfighter was noted for its durable, yet remarkably lightweight, wedge-shaped frame.

Although the resulting R-22 did test the limits of maneuverability and speed, the newly established Galactic Empire, successor state to the Republic, did not approve its mass production. Nevertheless, the monarch of Tammuz-an purchased the batch of R-22 prototypes for use in their planetary defense fleet. Because of their resemblance to a Tammuz-an ceremonial spear, the fighters were soon nicknamed \"Spearheads.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "More than a decade later, several of the anti-Empire rebel cells that would ultimately crystallize into the Alliance to Restore the Republic managed to acquire a number of Tammuz-an Spearheads. The highly customizable starfighters were left in the hands of the Underground Engineers, a network of rebel mechanics. The Engineers kept the remarkable frame of the R-22, but updated the weapons, installed new technology, and swapped the original engines with a pair of Novaldex J-77 \"Event Horizon\" sublight engines. The resulting craft was dubbed the RZ-1 A-wing interceptor. In time, the RZ-1 spawned its own variant, the two-seated RZ-1T trainer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the fall of the Galactic Empire and the transition of the Alliance to Restore the Republic into the New Republic, Kuat Systems Engineering brought back the R-22 design as the base for the RZ-2 A-wing interceptor, a more streamlined model that incorporated years of Rebel Alliance field modifications and customizations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The R-22 Spearhead originally appeared in the Star Wars Legends continuity, and was brought into canon in the 2017 reference book Star Wars: A-wing Deluxe Book and 3D Wood Model."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
