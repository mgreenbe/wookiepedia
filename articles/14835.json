Rather, the Yuuzhan Vong launched the attack in an attempt to ensure that the New Republic believed their captured intelligence that the next Yuuzhan Vong attack would be either Corellia or Bothawui. The Yuuzhan Vong hoped that the New Republic would deplete their forces protecting both planets, when they actually planned to attack Fondor next. During the battle, the Yuuzhan Vong captured the Tanallay Surge complex and used it to release a biotoxin into Tynna's world-sea. It quickly made the ocean deadly to any non-Yuuzhan Vong lifeforms, thus aiding in both their conquest and terraforming of the planet. The battle was witnessed by Belindi Kalenda and Showolter, who had arrived at Tynna in a LightStealth-18 Reconnaissance Ship. Despite their efforts to remain under the Vong radar, Nas Choka, who was in charge of the invasion of Tynna, noticed their craft."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
