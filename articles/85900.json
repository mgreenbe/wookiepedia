Commenting on the entry for the Model Q4 hold-out blaster pistol, Mallaggi noted that the weapon had a design flaw in the height of its front sight. The sight protruded enough that it made the weapon prone to snagging on clothing or holsters. Mallaggi recommended shaving down the sight, but did admit that doing so could reduce the weapon's accuracy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
