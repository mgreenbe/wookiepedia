Arrogha was employed by the company Culpharm as a security guard and he worked mainly as a night watchman at the Culpharm Central Laboratory on the planet Cularin. In about 32 BBY, Arrogha was given some time off work, so he went and hung out in the Landing Lights Bar, in the city of Hedrett. While he was off duty, an agent working for Biotherapy, a rival company of Culpharm, posed as Arrogha to steal a Culpharm specimen sample. Culpharm hired the Heroes of Cularin to investigate the theft and they traveled to the Landing Lights Bar, to ask Arrogha some questions. He denied every taking the samples and disliked being accused of doing so, as he believed that the heroes were questioning his integrity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
