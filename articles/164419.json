Bykart was a pilot who often ferried Master and Padawan pairs to the planet Ragoon-6 for a traditional field exercise, where Bykart would go into hiding and the pair would try to track down their fellow Jedi. Around 32 BBY, one of these pairs were Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi. Kenobi would later reflect on his time on Ragoon-6 with Bykart while on a trip to the planet with his own learner, Anakin Skywalker, in 27 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Winso Bykart was first mentioned in Jedi Quest: The Trail of the Jedi, a young-readers novel written by Jude Watson and published in 2002."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
