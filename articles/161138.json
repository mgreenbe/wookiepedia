It was claimed by droid-rights activists that the missile's central processor was so advanced that the entire construct should be considered sentient. Activists from the Mechanical Liberation Front attempted to free a shipment of the missiles near Havridam City on New Bakstre in 22 BBY. During the operation, the activists triggered the missiles' warheads, destroying a twenty-five kilometer area of Havridam City and killing themselves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
