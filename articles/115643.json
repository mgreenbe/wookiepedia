Huge herds of banthas, nerfs, and lesser known herd animals roam the planet's rolling grasslands. The world is hardly a frontier in the galaxy, but since it's used primarily to raise livestock, it's sparsely populated by sentient beings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Froswythe has a few tourist facilities for people who want to experience the ranching life. It's also rumored to be a bandit hideaway for Core World criminals, who can live in profound isolation out on the prairie in buildings of formed dirt that are virtually indistinguishable from the gentle hills that make up most of the planet's topography. One of these criminals, Fegred Ewd, crosses the heroes' paths in this adventure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Ride Herd\" is intended for four player characters of 6th or 7th level."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
