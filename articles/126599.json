Meanwhile, Scythe, a clone trooper of Tango Company, was taking a nap near a Republic landing zone. A Geonosian brain worm crept from underneath a pile of rumble and entered Scythe through his nose. The C.O. of Tango Company, Trap, saw the clone sleeping and woke him quickly. Scythe acted strangely distanced and followed Trap. In his backpack, he had put several brain worm eggs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The skirmish"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the Pelta-class frigate TB-73, Scythe placed the eggs in the room where several clones were sleeping. The eggs hatched and quickly moved towards their hosts. Most of the clones on the ship were now infected. In the ship's mess room, Offee and Tano were discussing Jedi matters, when they were suddenly attacked by two troopers. Quickly drawing their lightsabers, they disarmed the clones. Both of the Padawans wanted to know what was going on and soon they found out the ship was under control of the brain worm-infected clones, who had killed the two clone pilots and barricaded the main bridge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Barriss and Ahsoka managed to fight their way through the clones and found out the brain worms couldn't handle cold temperatures. Tano wanted to turn off the ship's climate control, but Offee too was infected. Ahsoka tried to turn it off, while fighting the now-infected Barriss in a lightsaber battle. It worked and all the brain worms were killed. TB-73 docked at the medical station with the help of two tug ships and the dead worms could now be inspected by Republic scientists."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
