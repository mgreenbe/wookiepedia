After spending a brief time operating in the outer reaches of the system, they realized that they were outclassed by the various pirate groups that were based in the Cularin system asteroid belt, so the League relocated to the city Tolea Biqua on the planet Genarius. There, they began running a number of scams in Tolea Biqua and in the platform city Bayonard on the nearby planet Cularin. However, the League was attacked by a rival criminal faction and their shuttle crashed within the grounds of Cularin's Blue Star Centre. The League took refuge inside the building and held the center's occupants hostage. Welles demanded that the group that attacked the Intarsa League be taken into custody, and that the League be provided with a starship and 10,000 credits, and be allowed to leave the centre unmolested. Eventually, the Office of Peace and Security assaulted the center, where they fought and defeated the League."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
