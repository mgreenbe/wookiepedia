Halfway up the pyramid, a cantilevered balcony reached out over the Funnel, and ended over the cenote opening. It was on this balcony the Sith preformed arcane rituals and sacrificed beings to the dark side. In the aftermath of the Sith's loss of control over the pyramid, the ruins were marked by external attack and an internal explosion which left the facility open to the elements."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
