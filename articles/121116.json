A scout squadron was comprised of two scout lances, with the lieutenant replacing the sergeant in the command lance. Although the lieutenant was officially in charge of the entire platoon, tradition left the \"grunts\" almost exclusively to the sergeant major, while the lieutenant handled the squadron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A scout platoon could be augmented by the addition of three more scout lances, and a line squad."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Special missions company had one augmented scout platoon attached. This variant had four scout lances instead of five, and no line squad. The sergeant major and the lieutenant were also provided with a speeder bike each. The special mission variant had 22 speeder bikes compared to the 10 speeder bikes in a standard platoon.
