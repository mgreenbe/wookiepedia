Thirty years later, the system was visited by the First Order's Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Finalizer, acting on a lead that a map to Luke Skywalker existed on the planet. The Millennium Falcon, piloted by Rey, Finn, and BB-8, escaped from the planet to be captured by the Eravana within the system. A conflict occurred onboard between Han Solo, Chewbacca and the fugitives with members of the Guavian Death Gang and Kanjiklub, and three rathtars. The group finally departed the system as Solo sent the Falcon into hyperspace directly from within the Eravana's docking bay."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
