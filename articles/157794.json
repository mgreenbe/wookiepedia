Kenobi talked to this guard, and asked for the codes to enter the area near the Palace. The guard gave Kenobi the code: J-154. The three were then attacked by more battle droids, but Kenobi destroyed the attackers and continued his mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This guard appears in the 1999 adaptation of the Episode I movie. The player, taking the role of Kenobi, may meet this guard during the course of the game's fifth mission. The player can talk to the guard using several dialogue options and can also choose to ignore the guard. If the player chooses the latter option, he can talk to another guard, who will open the door. This article assumes the player chose to talk to the guard. In the credits, Greg Burson is listed as voicing \"Injured Soldier #1\" while Nick Jameson is listed as voicing \"Injured Soldier #2.\" It is unclear who voices this character.
