They landed it at the Gateway refugee camp on Duro and were told by their mother, Leia Organa Solo, to use it to escape the Duro system prior to the impending Yuuzhan Vong attack, along with Randa Besadii Diori. The two of them refused to leave without Leia, or her Noghri bodyguard Olmahk. Jaina followed her mother's example in staying at the refugee camp and eventually loaded up NM-KO 28 with refugees and sent it away without Randa, her brother, Olmahk, or her mother when the initial Yuuzhan Vong invasion force, led by Warmaster Tsavong Lah, entered the system. Upon witnessing the Yuuzhan Vong's destruction of shuttles evacuating the orbital city Orr-Om, Jaina salved her moral qualms against stealing NM-KO 28 by speculating that the shuttle would have met a similar fate had she and Jacen left it on Bburru. The shuttle was equipped with a hyperdrive, and in Jacen's opinion, could accommodate four or five passengers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
