It consisted of a Wookiee senator and his or her aides. Despite their short tempers, Wookiee senators were respected for their firm sense of justice. The Trandoshans, another species from the Mytaranor sector, were resentful of the fact that Wookiees alone would represent their common area of space in the pan-galactic political arena."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
