Surik was skeptical and wished to know the nature of the information, and Kaul replied that it would lead to some good loot. Surik agreed and paid Kaul the twenty credits, and he told her that there were containers in the Exchange camp that were filled with supplies.

While the information he gives the player is correct, speaking with him is not required to continue the game's plot or to steal from the aforementioned containers.
