The first was the widely-used repulsorlifts. The droid had two built into the underside of its spherical frame. The Decimator also made use of twelve energy tendrils that were purple in hue and emitted from six laser-emitters on the top and bottom of the droid. When one tentacle located organic matter, the others closed in and vaporized it. If no organic material was found after fifteen seconds, however, the Decimator would automatically switch off. It also had a laser cutter capable of burning through solid metal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Decimator was sent by Wat Tambor to try to kill Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, Clone Captain Rex, and Clone Force 99 during their mission to rescue ARC trooper Echo from Skako Minor. However, due to being experimented on by the Techno Union, Echo had gained extensive knowledge of Purkoll through the central computer, allowing him to locate and open an exhaust vent that he, Skywalker, and the other clones escaped through just as the Decimator was burning a hole through the doors. Before they escaped, Wrecker placed several thermal detonators in the room. The Decimator's energy tentacles headed towards Wrecker, but Skywalker was able to lift him out of the lab and into the vent before he could be detected. Detecting no organic matter, the Decimator shut down moments before it was destroyed when Wrecker's explosives blew up the lab."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Decimator first appeared in \"On the Wings of Keeradaks,\" an episode of Star Wars: The Clone Wars that was first released in 2015 as an unfinished story reel before the completed version premiered on Disney+ in 2020.
