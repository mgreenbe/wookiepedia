In highly-polluted Reuss VIII, organs were a valuable good. This was a dangerous choice because Vorne's surgeons were everything but careful but, as the alternative meant facing some of Vorne's thugs, many debtors opted to try cybernetic replacements."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gunrunner Tiv \"Poke\" Pocarno, owner of the badly-maintained Suwantek Systems TL-1800 Transport Broken 'Spanner, asked Vorne for a loan he intended to return after a successful smuggling run off Rampa.
