Later, the group was ambushed by Asajj Ventress and BX-series droid commandos, and Fixer was one of the few clones who survived the ambush. After the group finally reached the Weather-control station, Fixer sliced into the junction box and changed the coordinates for the upcoming artificial storm, directing it at the station itself. The station was destroyed and mission's objective was achieved."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
