The rope, looped around the stick, was used to snag the interloper and keep him or her from escaping. Each capturing stick was unique, so the length varied from one to another. Nevertheless, the stick was a relatively close-range weapon that worked well during an ambush. Once the enemy was snagged, the rope pulled tight around his or her body, so the weapon's user then was able to control the captive, forcing a march, for example."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 ABY, the Lizard Warriors captured the Ewoks Teebo and Wicket W.
