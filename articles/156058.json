He was killed before the end of the Siege of Mandalore. When Order 66 was issued by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, the Republic clone forces turned against their commander, Ahsoka Tano. Tano managed to escape execution with the help of Clone Captain Rex, after removing his behavioral modification biochip. The two of them faked their deaths at each other's hands to cover their tracks. To sell the deception, they created a false grave for Rex, burying this trooper's body instead in some of Rex's armor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This clone trooper was first mentioned in the 2016 novel Ahsoka, written by E.
