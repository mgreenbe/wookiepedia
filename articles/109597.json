Prior to the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, Jinn, unsure of his role as a peacekeeper within a conflict on the planet Bri'n, took his astromech droid and traveled to a remote world, seeking guidance from the Force. He and the droid observed that the world was discovered long ago but never given a designation. As Jinn explored its surface on foot, the droid remained in the astromech socket of the Jedi's Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor. The astromech had a black sensor and green and white plating."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This droid first appeared in Age of Republic - Qui-Gon Jinn 1, the first issue of the Star Wars: Age of Republic comic-book miniseries.
