Shortly after the Galactic Republic's discovery of the Confederate warship Malevolence, Jedi General Anakin Skywalker developed a plan to attack the warship and its commander, General Grievous. Confederate Head of State Count Dooku ordered Grievous to target the Republic's secret Outer Rim medical center, and the Malevolence's eradication of a Republic medical convoy in the Ryndellia system identified the warship's quarry to the Republic.

The cannons neutralized all power to their targets, leaving their prey defenseless without the ability to use deflector shields and vulnerable to fire from the Malevolence's laser cannons. Under the command of General Grievous, the Confederate warship began a series of strikes on Republic task forces that left no survivors to tell the Republic of the weapon or its methods of attack, leading the Malevolence to be dubbed the \"mystery weapon\" for its unknown nature. The attacks formed no pattern, and the unpredictability of future targets drove fear throughout the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi General Plo Koon of the Jedi High Council volunteered to lead a hunt for the mysterious weapon and took a fleet of several Venator-class Star Destroyers to the Abregado system, where the Malevolence had been located. On Grievous's order, the warship attacked the Republic fleet with its ion cannons, and the cruisers launched several escape pods. The Confederate Head of State Count Dooku was aboard the warship and ordered rocket battle droids to eliminate the pods with boarding craft, not intending to allow the Republic to learn of the warship and its weapons. However, Koon and several clone troopers were rescued by Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan, Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano, and were able to escape the Malevolence, taking the knowledge of the warship to the Republic. Dooku, displeased with Grievous, left to discuss the general's failure with his Sith Master, Darth Sidious."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Preparing a counterattack"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the revelation of the superweapon's nature, Skywalker planned to lead a counterattack against the Malevolence with Shadow Squadron of starfighters. The Jedi applied for several BTL-B Y-wing starfighters through Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and Senator Ask Aak, but discovered that they were still in the experimental stage. Skywalker also learned that the request had to come via a Galactic Senate Committee. Unable to obtain the bombers through official means, Skywalker traveled directly to the testing facility over the planet Bormus where the fighters were being manufactured. Arriving with Shadow Squadron aboard his personal ship, the Twilight, Skywalker took the bombers under the pretense that the request had come from Palpatine himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Returning to his flagship, the Resolute, Skywalker developed a plan to lead Shadow Squadron on a direct attack on the Malevolence, believing that while the larger cruisers could not outmaneuver the warship, the bombers would be able to slip through the warship's defenses. The squadron's target was the Malevolence's bridge, where General Grievous would be maintaining command. With the death of Grievous, Skywalker believed that the war could be brought to a quicker end. Skywalker began preparations for his departure, and was to be accompanied by Tano and Plo Koon, the latter of whom chose to fly in Blade of Dorin, his Delta-7B starfighter."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A new target"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Count Dooku met with Darth Sidious and learned of the Republic's secret Outer Rim medical station, the Kaliida Shoals Medical Center, which was treating over 60,000 wounded Republic clones. As the Malevolence ambushed a Republic medical convoy in the Ryndellia system, Dooku contacted Grievous and ordered the cyborg general to target the medical center; without the medical base, the Republic would have nowhere to send its wounded clone troopers. Grievous was pleased with this new assignment, as it showed that the count had not lost all faith in him since his failure to prevent the escape of the Jedi during the Battle of Abregado. The Malevolence eradicated the convoy and proceeded to jump to hyperspace; however, as it was unable to pass through the nearby Kaliida Nebula, the warship was forced to take a longer route around to the medical center."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Skywalker learned of the convoy's defeat from Admiral Wullf Yularen, the Jedi deduced that the medical center was the warship's next target. Skywalker intended to take Shadow Squadron on a shortcut through the nebula in order to arrive at the medical station before the warship, and planned to attack the Malevolence before it could destroy the base. Admiral Yularen and High Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi resolved to take a hyperspace route around the nebula, planning to arrive at the medical center to reinforce Skywalker with several Venator-class cruisers, including the Resolute, as well as Kenobi's flagship, the Negotiator. Yularen warned the medical center's Kaminoan administrator, Nala Se, of the impending danger, and Kenobi contacted the people of the nearby planet Naboo; several Pelta-class frigates were sent to help evacuate the medical center."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker, Tano, Koon, and another Jedi Knight departed the Republic fleet with Shadow Squadron. Upon entering the nebula, they encountered several Neebray mantas, and Skywalker ordered the squadron to assume the single-file Bantha formation and follow him out of the nebula.

Shadow Squadron arrived at the medical center, located in the Ryndellia system, shortly before the Malevolence came out of hyperspace and approached the station. By this time, the medical center had evacuated half of its patients with the help of the Pelta-class frigates, but the clones being treated in bacta tanks were unable to be moved."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Attack on the Malevolence"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Skywalker, Tano, Koon, the Jedi Knight\u2014flying a Delta-7B interceptor\u2014and Shadow Squadron approached, the Malevolence attacked the fleeing Pelta-class frigates with its ion cannons.

Despite the fact that his own Vulture droids would be caught in the blast, Grievous ordered the warship's ion cannon to target the approaching Y-wing bombers. As the Malevolence fired its ion cannon, Skywalker immediately ordered his squadron to head for the top edge of the ray to avoid being neutralized. However, Matchstick's fighter malfunctioned, and his fighter crashed into fellow pilot Tag's bomber, while Shadow Six, Seven, and Ten, were caught in the ion ray."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even with its numbers cut in half, the Republic squadron continued toward the Malevolence and maneuvered through the incoming laser fire as the warship targeted the medcenter.

Taking Koon's suggestion to obliterate the warship's primary weapon, Skywalker changed the target to the starboard ion cannon, and he, Koon, and the Jedi Knight spearheaded the attack on the cannon.

Sidious, in the guise of his alter ego of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, manipulated Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala into traveling to the nebula, under the pretense that she would be meeting with an InterGalactic Banking Clan representative that wanted to negotiate a treaty with the Republic. Amidala agreed and headed to the nebula in her H-type Nubian yacht with her protocol droid, C-3PO.

Admiral Yularen deduced that the warship's hyperdrive was damaged because the Malevolence was not attempting to flee to hyperspace. Taking advantage of the warship's vulnerability, Kenobi ordered all laser fire to be directed at the Malevolence's bridge. The Resolute picked up the arrival of Amidala's yacht and contacted the ship, and Skywalker was dismayed to learn of Amidala's presence, as she was his secret wife. To protect the senator, the Republic fleet was forced to cease its laser fire at the Malevolence. Amidala's ship was pulled aboard the Malevolence with a tractor beam, as Grievous intended to use the senator as a hostage to ensure the warship's escape.

While attempting to contact the Republic fleet from a communications panel, Amidala and C-3PO were forced to hide from Grievous and a B1-Series battle droid patrol.

Back aboard the Resolute, Tano and Koon again contacted Unduli for support, and Unduli stated that she was on her way to the nebula with reinforcements. Amidala contacted the Republic fleet, and Tano patched the communication through to Skywalker and Kenobi, who arranged to rendezvous with Amidala at a rail jet junction in the middle of the ship. Upon arrival at the junction, Amidala and C-3PO were ambushed by a battle droid patrol, and the senator returned fire at the droids while she and her protocol droid backed toward the rail jets. Noticing the senator's blaster fire, Skywalker and Kenobi immediately ignited their lightsabers and Force Jumped across rail jet cars, dispatching several battle droids on their way to the senator. Amidala and C-3PO escaped onto separate rail jet cars, but a B2-HA series super battle droid fired a rocket at the junction Amidala's car was approaching, and Skywalker used the Force to pull Amidala onto his car.

The astromech droid halted the protocol droid's rail jet car and led him back to the Twilight. Grievous, however, was able to intercept the transmission between Kenobi, Skywalker, and Amidala, and the cyborg general proceeded to the ship's hyperdrive room to ambush Kenobi. As the Jedi entered the room and approached the battle droids guarding the hyperdrive, droid reinforcements arrived alongside Grievous and targeted Kenobi. Using several droidekas against their comrades, Kenobi Force-pushed two of the droids at the approaching battle droids behind them, then used the remaining droideka's deflector shield as protection from incoming blaster rifle fire from Grievous. Evenly matched with Grievous, Kenobi chose to escape, forcing the remaining droideka at Grievous and fleeing.

The general and the droids jumped toward the Jedi's rail jet car, but the battle droids were destroyed from an incoming rail jet. As Grievous approached, Kenobi noticed a large, mechanical arm hanging over the rail jet and used it to propel himself toward Grievous, landing a kick on the general.

Meanwhile, the Republic fleet prepared to attack the Malevolence once the Jedi returned with the senator, but with communications blocked, the cruisers were unable to contact Skywalker for an update of the mission's status. Finishing their mission, Skywalker and Amidala left the bridge shortly before more battle droids arrived to take command of the Malevolence. The Jedi and senator met up with R2-D2 and C-3PO, and at the airlock where the Twilight was docked, Kenobi arrived, pursued by several droidekas.

A piece of scrap with the insignia of the Free Dac Volunteers Engineering Corps, a starship-construction organization that was based out of Pammant, was recovered from the destroyed warship, but a circuit board that had not been manufactured by the Quarrens was also found amongst the debris. After the clone squad's return to Coruscant, the piece was sent to the Jedi Archives, and Jedi Master Ring-Sol Ambase was able to confirm that the board was built by KynachTech Industries, a worker force based out of his own homeworld. Master Ambase and the clone trooper squad were dispatched to Kynachi to follow the lead, unaware that they were heading into a trap set by the Dark Lord Darth Sidious. Eventually, the Confederacy decided to rebuild the Malevolence, and Grievous personally supervised the operation.
