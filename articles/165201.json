It had been developed by the Malkite Poisoners. Extremely rare and expensive, it preyed on the tissues of the brain, slowing a victim's thinking and making them become slow and sluggish. Victims would become addicted to the substance, over a space of several weeks or months, to such an extent that an abrupt withdrawal of the toxin would kill the addicted being."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
