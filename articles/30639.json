Realizing that his forces were badly outnumbered, Kelsan ordered the crews of all his ships to set the ships for self-destruct and then leave them in the escape pods. Peto Kelsan himself choose to stay on his ship, Avenger and perished along with the fleet. The only remaining ship of the fleet was Ardent-class fast frigate Steadfast, which took some damage that disabled its self-destruct mechanism. Admiral Gar Stazi of the Galactic Alliance Remnant decided to deposit both its captain Vaclen Tor and his crew to the surface of Ralltiir and then send the ship to Emperor Roan Fel as a gift."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
