A commanding officer employing the fake would rush towards the enemy as if preparing for a brawl, hoping to lure their opponent into breaking formation to counter the move. At the last moment, the incoming ships would heel hard over, forming into a line and blasting the incoming enemy with a running broadside. Enemy commanders who broke formation to counter a brawl were in trouble if caught by the tactic, but commanders who held formation had the opportunity to wheel their forces in behind the last ship and bracket it with weapons fire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
