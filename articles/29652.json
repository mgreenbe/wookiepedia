This device was used as an electronic countermeasure by many starship pilots. When deployed, the copycat pod sent out transponder signals identical to those of the parent vessel. They were used by pirates so that police ships would vector in on the Copycat Pod's signal. Hoping to board the offending vessel, the police forces would find that the real vessel had escaped, and the sensor was bouncing in open space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
