During that time, Doctor Vigh was leading the Parasophic Arachne program,  an illegal and dangerous bioengineering project. The objective was to create an intelligent and powerful form of arachnes for the use of the Galactic Empire. Circa 1 ABY, the project was a success and Dr. Vigh ordered to transport several specimens to the Imperial research facility on Nubia. However, the situation really went wrong in a short time. The transport carrying the creatures crashed in the mountains near Nashal just after its departure and the arachnes escaped in the wilderness. Moreover, the arachnes in the GeneTech Syndicate laboratory escaped containment, overwhelmed and slaughtered their creators. The Corellian Security Force eventually discovered the terrible situation in the lab. Most of the staff was murdered by the creatures but some surviving scientists had fled and went into hiding to avoid being arrested by the CorSec and charged with illegal biological experiments."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
