Amidala journeyed through the swamps of Naboo, escorted by the two Jedi and a small posse of Naboo security guards.

Nass agreed, and the two warring cultures hastily put an end to their dispute to concentrate on a more pressing issue: the occupation of Naboo. Amidala presented her formulated plan to the group, which would consist of her leading a strike team into the Royal Palace and capturing the Viceroy, while at the same time the Gungan Grand Army would lead a ground assault to distract the droid armies.

She then attempted desperately to change their minds against passing the bill, citing that the Separatists would \"offer violence in turn\" and that freedom itself would be at risk, but the session was postponed due to a need to review security measures.

Despite this, she still tried to keep her relationship with Anakin a secret, even after they were married."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even then, she remained loyal as a Senator to her people, and continually urged Skywalker to stay loyal to the Order, even when, at times, he wanted to refuse an order because of the long periods of time away from her. Though pained by the long separations they had to endure, Amidala kept strong for them both, knowing the great burden placed on both of their shoulders. She believed strongly in Skywalker, and when she heard of his exploits during the Clone Wars, she was enthralled, though she remained worried for his safety. Her belief in him became even more evident when she began to believe him over the Jedi Order when he told of their manipulations of him to use him as a spy for their own purposes. She was reluctant even to believe Obi-Wan, a close friend of theirs, when he told her of Anakin's dark deeds. Partly to reassure herself that what he had said was not true, she traveled to Mustafar to ask Skywalker herself. When her husband confirmed her worst nightmares, she still refused to believe that he could not come back to the light and urged him to do so. Even at her death, Amidala continued to have faith in her husband, speaking of the good still in him\u2014though no one believed her at the time. Twenty-three years later, her son would come to share this belief, proven correct when Vader turned on his Master to save his son."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though her marriage to Skywalker was undoubtedly the closest of all her relationships, Amidala maintained a number of close friendships throughout her life. From her early days, Amidala was a favorite of Onaconda Farr, who served alongside her father in the Senate. Their relationship was so close that Amidala even referred to him as \"Uncle Ono.\" This friendship only became strained at one point when Farr briefly joined the Separatist Alliance after despairing of Republic aid during a severe famine. Though Farr had Amidala imprisoned on the orders of Nute Gunray, Viceroy of the Trade Federation and Amidala's archenemy, Amidala forgave him wholeheartedly for his mistake and later defended his honor in front of Farr's Senatorial aide and murderer, Lolo Purs. Amidala's other close friends in the Galactic Senate included Bail Prestor Organa, who would eventually adopt her daughter, and Mon Mothma. They often worked alongside Amidala in peace efforts before and during the Clone Wars, though Organa and Mothma eventually became skeptical of the direction in which the Republic was headed under the control of Palpatine. Though Amidala was outspoken in her loyalty to the Republic, Mothma and Organa trusted her enough to invite her to secret meetings that proved to be the seed of the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amidala was loved by all her people for the interest she showed in their personal lives, no matter how menial their roles. Thus, it is no surprise that Amidala was quite close to her handmaidens and staff. During her reign as Queen of Naboo, Amidala selected a number of handmaidens alongside whom she had trained. These handmaidens assisted her in her personal life as a monarch and were her last line of defense in case of an emergency. As queen, Amidala was particularly close to Sab\u00e9, who served as her double whenever the queen was in extreme danger. They were so close that Amidala and Sab\u00e9 could communicate in the subtlest of phrases or glances. Sab\u00e9 would later be enlisted by Bail Organa to train her former mistress's daughter. As a Senator, Amidala cut down on the number of handmaidens who attended her, though she still remained close to those she had. One of these handmaidens, Cord\u00e9, was killed in an explosion intended to put the Senator out of commission before an important vote. Amidala was grief-stricken at the loss of Cord\u00e9. Her only other handmaiden at the time, Dorm\u00e9, remained unshaken by this loss and voluntarily doubled for Amidala when she fled into hiding on Naboo following a second assassination attempt. In fact, Dorm\u00e9 remained more concerned for Amidala than she did for her own safety. While staying with Skywalker on Naboo, Amidala enlisted the help of a family friend, Teckla Minnau, who later served Amidala as handmaiden briefly during the Clone Wars. The last handmaiden to serve Amidala before her untimely death was Mote\u00e9. Mote\u00e9 was one of the few privileged to know of Amidala's marriage as she helped the Senator dress appropriately to conceal her pregnancy. Amidala also developed decent friendships with her heads of security, Panaka and Typho. Though Typho developed a love interest in Amidala, the Senator never let their friendship go beyond a strictly professional level."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Both during her reign as queen and her time serving as a Senator, Amidala presented herself as an advocate for the Gungans. Relationships between the Human inhabitants of Naboo and the natives had always been tense, but during the invasion by the Trade Federation, Amidala managed to unite the two species against a common enemy. She and Gungan Boss Nass achieved a level of mutual respect, which she carried even for his successor, Boss Lyonie. Amidala also worked so that the unrepresented Gungans might have a say in the Galactic Senate. This goal was achieved when Jar Jar Binks became a representative of Naboo alongside Amidala. Eventually, Binks also became a Senator. During the Clone Wars, the Gungans continued to call on Amidala for aid when relations between them and the Naboo became somewhat unstable. Amidala was summoned when battle droids appeared once again on the planet and a mysterious plague instantly killed the Shaak of a Gungan herder named Peppi Bow. Later, Amidala was also sent to Otoh Gunga when Boss Lyonie stirred up dissent among the Gungans while under the influence of Rish Loo. Ultimately, Amidala's constant care for the Gungans turned the tide in the battle on Mon Calamari between the Mon Cala and the Quarren."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike many Senators, Amidala also maintained close contact with her homeworld's ruling monarch.

After parting ways after the Battle of Theed, he continually thought of her, and his fascination grew for his bold and beautiful friend, who was four years his senior. They met again ten years later, and his fascination blossomed into love. After a hair-raising series of adventures together, she began to return his affection. Padm\u00e9 accompanied Anakin to Tatooine when he sensed that his mother was in mortal danger, and at the Lars farm, they met Shmi's husband, who revealed that she had been kidnapped by a Tusken tribe. When Anakin returned with his mother's corpse, Amidala tried to comfort him, but Anakin revealed that he had massacred the whole village, including women and children, in revenge for the death of his mother.
