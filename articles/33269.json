Circa 1 ABY, he was shot in an ambush during a mission in the Paitnnu Wetlands and severely injured. Borvo's bodyguard sent him a spacer with medicine, and thus saved Dagorel's life. Dagorel later discovered that he was trapped during that mission by one of Borvo's most trusted henchmen known as Niksel Frangee. The spacer who saved Dagorel was thus tasked to assassinate Frangee. Borvo's guard, Dagorel and the spacer finally found that Frangee was an infiltrated agent of the Corellian Security Force. Dagorel also discovered that Frangee entered Borvo's organization thanks to one of Borvo's former business partner known as Montrus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dagorel appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
