The vessel was colored a light blue-gray, with subtle yellow bow stripes which distinguished it from other Providence-class vessels."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the command ship of the Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies, it also served as the flagship for the Confederacy of Independent Systems. At the height of the Clone Wars in 19 BBY, it had become one of the most feared ships in the galaxy.

Each shot from the point-defense ion cannons released as much heat as a 4.8 megaton bomb, while the maximum yield of one of the quad turbolasers was equivalent to a magnitude 10 groundquake."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Grievous's replacement flagship, the Invisible Hand was given several major modifications.

Viceroy Nute Gunray chose the Invisible Hand as his flagship. When the Trade Federation joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems, they diverted their heavy Providence-class starships to the Confederate Navy, including the Invisible Hand."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since control of the Separatist forces was handed to Grievous, after he \"lost\" the Malevolence, Gunray reluctantly surrendered the Invisible Hand to the cyborg general to use as a replacement flagship at the behest of Darth Sidious. Gunray's reluctance was assuaged by permission to allow Lushros Dofine to be the captain of the ship, and he assigned Neimoidian navigators and controllers to the bridge crew."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Invisible Hand saw action at many engagements including at Belderone, Humbarine, Duro, and the final Separatist strike on Coruscant. As part of Operation Durge's Lance, Grievous oversaw numerous atrocities from the bridge of the ship, such as the deployment of the Brainrot Plague in the Weemell sector. As the new flagship of the infamous General Grievous, slaughterer of billions, its name was so feared that Republic agents made a concerted effort to track the ship, but Grievous frequently swapped to a pair of \"decoys\", Lucid Voice and Colicoid Swarm, for Mid Rim patrols to confuse the enemy and further terrorize unsuspecting Republic worlds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was aboard the Invisible Hand that Palpatine was held captive and Count Dooku lost his life to Anakin Skywalker during the Battle of Coruscant. The Battle of Coruscant would be the Invisible Hand's last battle, however."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the suddenness of the attack, as well as heavy signal jamming, not all Republic forces were aware of the Chancellor's presence aboard the Invisible Hand and continued firing on it. A barrage of turbolaser fire from the Venator-class Star Destroyer Guarlara took the Invisible Hand down. Due to Captain Dofine's quick thinking: reversed stabilizers, magnetized fields; and General Grievous's last resort measure\u2014the emergency booster engines\u2014the ship was righted again, but not for long."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a skirmish on the bridge with Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi the main viewport was shattered by Grievous in order to make his escape, sucking most of the crew into space. Dofine and what remained of the crew ran off the bridge, allowing the Invisible Hand to finally succumb to Coruscant's gravity, splitting in two as it fell out of orbit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Against all odds, Skywalker landed what was left of the ship in an abandoned industrial zone, knocking over a radar tower in the process.
