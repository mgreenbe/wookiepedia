Towards this goal, he desired a Sith artifact capable of interacting with the dark side of the Force, increasing the power of the darksider using it. This led him to create the elaborately-adorned Bracers of Najus, which boosted the wielder's dark side power whenever that power was used against an adherent of the light side; however, if the target of an attack resorted to the dark side of the Force, the Bracers would benefit the target rather than the wielder."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bracers of Najus were lost when the Sith starship in which they were crash-landed in the planet Leritor. Centuries later, the dark side adept and scholar Profex Rynalla found a trail to the Bracers in the archives of the University of Sanbra and went to Leritor with Klatooinian minions to recover Najus's legacy. She hoped to find the Bracers in the remains of the ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
