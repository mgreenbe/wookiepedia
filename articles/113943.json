Just prior to the Clone Wars, Padawan Dielle was dispatched to Kabal with fellow Knights Ixian Rovieda, Plessus Ghon, and Nygreena Clo to end the month-long riots in the capital city of Shoribus. The riots begun due to planet-wide food shortages, and were only ended when the Confederacy of Independent Systems dropped parcels of rations and other food stuff within the city.
