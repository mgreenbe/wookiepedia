He used it to attempt to kill a Hutt enforcer disguised as a Jedi, who had been sent to kill the Consortium's leader, a Bothan crime lord name Akris Ur'etu. Bane placed the sensor within the entrance to a Skar'kla base separate to the buildings security as it was more difficult to bypass. He then waited on the roof above for it to be triggered, predicting when it was set off it would be due to Akris fleeing the enforcer. His prediction was proved correct and the Bothan and several thugs triggered it whilst Bane waited."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Portable sensor fields first appeared in the short story Reputation written by Ari Marmell and illustrated by Tom Hodges which was published in Star Wars Insider 136 in 2012."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
