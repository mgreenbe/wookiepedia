During a mission to sabotage a Imperial communications hub on a backwater planet, Truno was made commander of Team Bantha, whose objective was to create a diversion by attacking an Imperial administration center. During the attack, the shuttle Team Bantha was using was destroyed on arrival, and so Truno and his pilot Ryenne stole an Imperial starship to escape. Truno and Ryenne then headed for Sunfall Peak, where the hub was located, to pick up Team Thumper, the team assigned to sabotage the hub. En route however, an Imperial officer still onboard the shuttle attacked the pilot, causing the ship to partially collide with a canyon wall."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Truno managed to pull off the Imperial and subdue him by bellowing at him with one of his four mouths, although sustaining a wound to the mouth in the process. The Ithorian then attended to the damage done by the canyon wall, fixing the shields but being unable to repair the stabilizer. Agent Corvan of Team Thumper then contacted Truno and Ryenne, and they tried made a plan as to how to recover Team Bantha. Upon reaching the hub, Ryenne left the shuttle, handing over controls to Truno, and managed to open a jammed blast door that was trapping the other Rebel team. Once Team Thumper was free, the Lieutenant opened fire on the pursuing Imperials while the other Rebels boarded the stolen shuttle. Once onboard the group saw a pair of Star Destroyers in low orbit releasing TIE fighters, and Corvano revealed the shuttle that Truno and Ryenne had stolen belonged to the local Imperial governor and so contained valuable intelligence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On another occasion the members of Team Bantha and Team Thumper managed to steal data from an Imperial base by downloading it onto a datapad.
