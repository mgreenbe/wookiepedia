Her liaison with Fett was a sore point, as he broke off the relationship without warning, and later insisted that she had mistaken him for one of the many clones produced from his father's template.

In this capacity, she escorted Manuel Both-Hanz to a meeting on Tatooine with Lando Calrissian, Tag Greenley, and Bink Otauna, intended to bring vital intelligence on the new Death Star to the Alliance. After her initial rendezvous was botched, she thought that she had gained some compensation by capturing Fett, although it was actually Tag inside the bounty hunter's armor. The arrival of the real Fett complicated matters, and in the ensuing firefight, Manny was killed by a shot through the chest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She was last seen fighting Fett in a Mos Eisley docking bay, while Tag and Bink blasted their way off-planet aboard what may have been her own ship\u2014a Lambda-class shuttle with a powerful holocomm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kannen's appearance was based on Drea Hoffman, Kevin Rubio's best friend."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kannen is normally shown as a redhead, but she is blond in \"Fett Club\", with a different art team, including Wil Glass rather than Dan Jackson as colorist.

Marangon explains, \"See, Kannen Doom was modeled after Kevin's best friend, Drea Hoffmann, who is actually blond (and a terrific girl, lemme tell ya). Dan Jackson didn't know that when he was coloring the book so he decided to get creative about it, but when I got the chance of doing a colored cover for the TPB, I had to be faithful to the \"actual\" character.\"[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The explanation for Kannen's youthful attractiveness in both \"Fett Club\" and The Return of Tag & Bink: Special Edition was given in a \"Creators Note\" added to this page by Kevin Rubio himself: Kannen is Human and does age.
