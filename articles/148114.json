After several skirmishes with the Republic's experimental stealth ship, lead by General Anakin Skywalker and Admiral Wullf Yularen, Trench locked onto the ship's magnetic signature from his flagship Invincible and fired several tracking torpedoes. Skywalker proceeded to fly the stealth ship straight at the Invincible, skimming past its hull at breakneck speed, and the torpedoes slammed straight into the bridge of Trench's flagship, destroying the ship and severely injuring Trench."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
