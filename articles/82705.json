It had a heavy metal door to prevent the captive from escaping. Some of them came with a slit in the steel door so the captive could see out. These lockers tended to be very small (only several feet wide) and provided no room for a humanoid to sit. Nym locked Vana Sage in one while he went out to attack Trade Federation Superfreighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
