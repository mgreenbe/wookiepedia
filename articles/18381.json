At the Battle of Ryloth, they flew V-19 Torrent starfighters under the command of Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano. As Tano led the squadron into battle against the Separatist blockade, four more Munificent-class frigates jumped out of hyperspace and joined the blockade. Although she received orders to abandon the assault, Tano recklessly pressed forward. Her disobedience cost her squadron, as only two of her pilots survived the battle. At least one pilot from the squadron saw action during the Battle of Coruscant, during which he faced several vulture droid starfighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
