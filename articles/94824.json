Nacronis was chosen as one of the targets of the operation despite the planet posing no threat to the Empire; in fact, none of the Imperials tasked with its destruction had heard of Nacronis beforehand. Colonel Shakara Nuress of the Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing was ordered to participate in the destruction, finding the operation distasteful but not questioning it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Along with other Imperial squadrons, the 204th's pilots, led by Major Soran Keize, were tasked with stoking the siltstorms of Nacronis using specialized vortex detonators deployed from their TIE bombers in the absence of the satellites employed elsewhere during the campaign.

During her time with her former unit, which had since embarked on a second destructive Cinder campaign, Quell imagined the genocide of Nacronis and other worlds it had attacked. After returning to the New Republic, Quell told the entire truth about her defection on Nacronis to General Hera Syndulla. In a confrontation with Keize on the capital planet Coruscant, Quell's former mentor absolved her of any responsibility in the genocide, yet it did not relieve her of the burden.
