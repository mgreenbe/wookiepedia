During the Clone Wars, a fake version of the blade was discovered on the moon Korasa and taken to a research facility in Timira City on the planet Kamino to be studied by Republic technicians, who incorrectly believed the blade to be genuine. Hoping to sell the weapon for thousands of credits, two rival bounty hunter squads raided Timira City, hoping to steal the blade. The bounty hunters Boba Fett, Bossk and C-21 Highsinger breached the research facility's vault and successfully escaped with the artifact, though in the aftermath of the mission they realized that the blade was fake and thus worthless."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
