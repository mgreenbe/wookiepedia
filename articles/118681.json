Holdo programmed SE-4Z to watch over Mersh Pellus, a brilliant but absent-minded scientist. SE-4Z was responsible for reminding Mersh his magni-lens goggles were on the top of his head, and stopping him from entering the bridge during battles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time before he served the Resistance, SE-4Z served the emir of Grand Tharkand. He frequently compared the Tharkandian Royal palace to the mess of the Resistance. To stay sane, SE-4Z loaded engineering textbooks and invention databases into his memory. He would consult these whenever Mersh's science team aboard the Ninka encountered a problem."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
