Eventually, during the visit at Khaz's apartment, one of the investigators discovered the planted trophy. At that time, Freet appeared in the apartment in what was staged to be a coincidence and had the Kubaz arrested for burglary, although Khaz loudly proclaimed his innocence. Subsequently, Freet thanked the individuals, who were also financially compensated for their efforts. Upon leaving Oseon 8920, the group was captured by thugs affiliated with Nex, who, suspicious of Freet's involvement in the theft, later sent the group to break into the residence Slake's agent had on the asteroid Oseon 5631."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Oseon 8920 was one of the several locations in the Oseon system that harbored criminal elements and thrived on its resultant odious reputation.
