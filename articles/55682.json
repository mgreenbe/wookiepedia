Later on, at night, the Trandoshans captured a Wookiee, Chewbacca and Clutch and Goron brought him to Island Four. However Ahsoka, along with two other previously captured Padawans, O-Mer and Jinx attacked the cruiser. Goron left to handle the prisoners while Clutch piloted the ship. Goron attacked two of the Padawans, Jinx and O-Mer atop the ship while Ahsoka snuck inside the ship where she fought with Clutch. Goron threw O-Mer aside while he fought with Jinx. But O-Mer came up and with Jinx's help, tackled Goron. But he soon grabbed O-Mer and began to strangle him while Jinx jumped on top of him. However, due to the fight inside the ship, the controls overloaded, spinning the ship out of control. Goron lost his balance and was hanging off the edge of the ship. He grabbed O-Mer's leg and struggled to pull him down but Jinx came down and kicked Goron's face twice before he finally fell down to his death. Clutch was also killed when Ahsoka Force Pushed him through the front windshield. The three Padawans along with Chewbacca survived and escaped to the jungle while the ship crashed. The next morning, Clutch and Goron's bodies were retrieved from the ship's wreckage by the rest of the Trandoshans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
