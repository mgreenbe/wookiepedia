In the thousand-year period before the Galactic Civil War, countless hyperspace explorers plumbed the Greater Javin for an efficient route that would connect the central Corellian Trade Spine with the Nothoiin homeworld. They sought to establish lasting trade with Nothoiin's alien civilization, but their dreams were dashed by the region's vast Twin Nebulae, a navigational nightmare."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Centuries passed before the entrepreneur Ecclessis Figg succeeded where so many had failed. Figg's scout ships miraculously blazed new hyperspace routes through the tangles of the Twin Nebulae on either side of the Corellian Trade Spine to reach worlds previously accessible only by expensive, roundabout journeys. The new Nothoiin Corridor linked the Trade Spine with the planets Bavva and Nothoiin, and even extended into the neighboring Tungra sector. Thanks to Figg's new hyperspace shortcuts, the Greater Javin exploded into an economic powerhouse."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Originally part of the Republic's Javin sector, Bavva was reorganized into the new Anoat sector circa 400 BBY.
