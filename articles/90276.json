Its most celebrated officer was Tam Posla. Posla's final case with them involved reports of kidnapping, forced servitude and surgical alteration. But after he travelled beyond his sanctions to bring justice to the pair, forcing his superior officer to take his badge. At some point between 0 ABY and 3 ABY, the rogue archaeologist Chelli Aphra and assassin droid 0-0-0 traveled to Milvayne. 0-0-0 almost immediately killed a border officer and more of the Milvayne Authority arrived to bring justice to them.

Aphra, however, was able to turn the officers on Posla, ensuing a skirmish that allowed the fugitives to escape. The Milvayne Authority eventually caught up with Aphra, 0-0-0 and two of their allies at Milvayne City's South District Seven, backed by stormtroopers.

The Milvayne authority also threw over droids that were deemed \"defective.\" This was categorized by features as insignificant as a bit of rust.

Evazan was eventually nicknamed the \"Mutilator of Milvayne\" for the crimes he had committed. Posla was eventually taken off the case by the his superior officer but learned of a similar string of crimes on the moon of Jedha. Determined to bring justice to them, Posla went to Jedha and his superior officer took his badge, decommissioning him for absence and telling him he had no sanction.

The pair were then pinned down by the Milvayne authority officers on their speeders and 0-0-0 decided to self-destruct Posla's ship as a distraction. This worked, and the Milvayne Authority officers abandoned their pursuit of the criminals to respond to the explosion. Sometime after, Aphra and 0-0-0 attempted to bribe a train driver for transport to South District Seven when 0-0-0 threatened his life.

Posla, who was hunting the pair, joined a number of Milvayne Authority officers in following one of the tip-offs to Aphra and 0-0-0, who were traveling on a bloatbarge across the undercity.

Aphra argued against Posla's authority over her and 0-0-0's lives, pointing out that he had been decommissioned.
