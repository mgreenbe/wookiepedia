It was commanded by Exarch Andur Melor and protected by multiple Skytroopers and Knights of Zakuul. The Gormak saw the Star Fortress as a source of the disease that affected their young, old and weak. In 3631 BBY, a Gormak warrior Rokuss teamed up with the Commander of the Anti-Zakuul Alliance to take down the Star Fortress. Together they assembled a strike team that assaulted and destroyed the Voss shield bunker protecting the Star Fortress before regrouping on the Alliance base on Odessen. From there, Theron Shan and Miot Dengd assisted the Commander in infiltrating the Star Fortress. After fighting their way through multiple levels of the station, the Commander was able to reach the Sun Generator room and engage the Exarch directly. During the fierce fighting, safety features of the Sun Generator were disabled and Exarch Andur Melor was killed. The Commander barely managed to escape on the shuttle before the Sun Generator overloaded, vaporizing the entire Star Fortress and all of its remaining personnel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Voss Star Fortress appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire as one of six Star Fotresses that can be assaulted and destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
