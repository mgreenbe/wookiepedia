Set against their pale-white skin, their countenance sported a high brow, a mouth bordered by prominent pink lips, a long nose that ended in two oblong nostrils, and two pronounced ocular ridges. Located at either side of the nose, the eye sockets contained two large, ovular, pitch-black eyes rimmed with pink flesh. Coarse, ropey, off-white hair came from the scalp, growing long enough in some specimens to cascade down the humanoid neck and shoulders. Two humanoid arms extended from the shoulders and ended in white, thin-fingered hands with fingernails that grew long and gray in at least some cases. Adult Zeuols were capable of growing to roughly 1.75 meters tall. The Zeuol species had at least one sex, female."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Clone Wars, at least some Zeuols had access to spacefaring technology and were able to visit distant planets. A female Zeuol's personal adornments might have included an elaborate, brocade gown that fell to the floor from a riveted leather collar about the shoulders.

In scenes shot in Australia on September 16, 2003, the character was portrayed by Jacqui Louez, the assistant to the producer of the film, Rick McCallum, and the director, George Lucas. During filming, Louez's character was referred to as \"Senator Jacquito.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The head of Lucasfilm Licensing, Sue Rostoni, gave the character her final name; when she noticed a group of Revenge of the Sith characters who lacked official monikers, she chose to give the pale-faced senator a tuckerization of her own name. The character's species was first identified in the StarWars.com Databank. The spellings of the names of the character and her home planet have varied from source to source. Before it went offline, the Databank called the character \"Eesu Estornii,\" while a 2005 article in Star Wars Insider 85 labels her \"Ecusu Estornii.\" Later sources have consistently spelled the name \"Eeusu Estornii,\" the spelling this article adopts. The Senator's homeworld has been spelled both \"Ord Zeoul\" and \"Ord Zeuol,\" even in a single source. This article adopts the latter spelling, as it is used in a more recent publication, 2009's The Essential Atlas. The name of the species itself has only appeared in the Databank, where it was spelled \"Zeuol.\" No indication of the plural form appeared, so this article follows standard English pluralization. While the Databank identified Ord Zeuol as Estornii's home planet, no source has explicitly named it as the homeworld of the entire Zeuol species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
