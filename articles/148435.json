The spell allowed the caster to enter a deep trance that slowed all of their bodily functions. The Ascendants heartbeat slowed, breathing dropped, and lapsed into unconsciousness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ascendants using trance could heal while under its effects, and could also set a condition under which they would awaken. These stimuli were specific, such as the touch of someone else, or a specific noise.
