The clones successfully distracted the Zygerrians by releasing a caged rancor, allowing them to free the Falleen prisoners. However, when one squad member, Omega, addressed the girl as Muchi, the Falleen prisoner communicated that it was not her who was Muchi, but the rancor. Regardless, the clones freed and safely escorted the Falleen to a pair of speeder bikes at the south entrance of the city. There, the Falleen escaped the city with the child and thanks his rescuers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Falleen prisoner appeared in \"Rampage,\" the fifth episode of the series Star Wars: The Bad Batch, released on Disney+ on May 28, 2021.
