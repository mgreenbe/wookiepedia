The ship was modified to be even more luxurious while also having more firepower then a standard PLY-3000. Han Solo accompanied Roa in his ship while tracking Reck Desh in the early months of the Yuuzhan Vong War. Roa modified this luxury yacht by installing furniture-grade uwa wood from Alderaan on almost every walkway and bulkhead. Spaces that were not furnished with the wood were made to look as though they were. The Happy Dagger also sported an acceleration couch which Roa had upholstered in crosh-hide and shimmersilk. It was abandoned after a failed Yuuzhan Vong attack on Ord Mantell."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
