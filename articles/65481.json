The Imperial Interdictor was placed under the command of Admiral Brom Titus of the Imperial Navy, who tested the cruiser's capabilities against a rebel patrol in the Del Zennis system. Shortly later, the Imperial Interdictor captured a rebel starship called the Liberator, the flagship of the Phoenix Cell's leader Commander Jun Sato. Among the rebel captives was Ezra Bridger, a young Jedi apprentice who was a perennial foe of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A jubilant Admiral Titus then informed the Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus of his recent catch. Despite Kallus' warnings to secure Ezra, Titus disbelieved Kallus' claims that a youth could threaten the Imperial Navy. Later, several rebels\u2014the Jedi Kanan Jarrus, Captain Rex, and the astromech droid Chopper\u2014infiltrated the Imperial Interdictor. They then encountered Ezra, who had already managed to free himself, and quickly freed Commander Sato and his crew. Meanwhile, Chopper and Ezra sabotaged the Interdictor's gravity well projectors. Following a skirmish aboard the Interdictor, the rebels managed to escape on the Liberator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Admiral Titus ordered his crew to power the gravity well projectors, but they instead drew in not just the Liberator, but the Interdictor's escorting Arquitens-class command cruisers as well. The light cruisers crashed into the Imperial Interdictor, one into the ventral side, and one scrapping the dorsal surface that eventually made its way to the bridge, triggering an explosion from the gravity wells that destroyed the warship and its escorts. In the midst of the explosion, the Phoenix rebels escaped into hyperspace aboard the Liberator. Admiral Titus managed to escape the Imperial Interdictor's destruction by fleeing into an escape pod and survived to report the debacle to Agent Kallus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
