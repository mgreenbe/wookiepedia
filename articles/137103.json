Leland Chee had initially indicated that Lucasfilm would not be using the \"Sulorine\" spelling in the future but later reversed his position. Use of the \"Sulorine\" spelling has once again been discontinued with the publishing of the Star Wars: The Essential Atlas Online Companion. The Essential Atlas Online Companion's sector map of the Outer Rim's galaxies included the sector spelling it as \"Suolriep\". No mention of \"Sulorine sector\" is made. This has resulted in Secrets of the Sisar Run being the only source to inconsistently misspell the sector name."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With regard to the the Suolriep/Sulorine spelling discrepencies in the novel Outbound Flight, Jason Fry noted that the planet Sulorine was a typo of \"Suolriep\" however it was decided to \"let it exist\". This has led to the establishment of the planet Sulorine in the Sulorine system. Unlike Secrets of the Sisar Run however, no mention of a \"Sulorine sector\" is made in Outbound Flight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
