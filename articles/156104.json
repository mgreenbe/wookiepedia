Alongside his superiors, the officer coordinated the hunt for the rogue Advanced Recon Commando CT-5555 \"Fives\" and medical droid AZI-3, who were investigating a conspiracy surrounding the death of CT-5385 \"Tup.\" Clad in the gray-patterned armor of the Kamino security force, the clone officer pursued the fugitives through the halls of Tipoca City. After the duo successfully acquired a Kaminoan flight pod, the officer tracked the ship on the orders of General Ti until he was informed that someone was accessing the genotype of the late bounty hunter Jango Fett, the original template of the Galactic Republic's clone troopers. Surmising that this was the work of their escapees, the officer and his superiors attempted to apprehend them in the Genetic Records Hall, but the fugitives escaped by utilising an access hatch that connected to a series of city service tunnels."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ordered by Nala Se to station his troops at each of the main hallway system's access points, the officer was forced to rescue the Kaminoan scientist when she secretly confronted Fives and AZI-3, in the Tipoca City embryo room by herself. Accompanied by Shaak Ti and a contingent of clone troopers, the officer instructed Fives not to move. The ARC trooper pleaded with his pursuers to listen to his worries about the inhibitor chips planted in the clones. With Se as the fugitives' hostage, the officer and the others agreed to hear Fives' case against the chips and his belief in a conspiracy against the Republic.

He was created to serve in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars, a conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Assigned to the Republic's security force on Kamino, the officer was subordinate to Jedi General Shaak Ti and Chief Medical Scientist Nala Se. In 19 BBY, when Advanced Recon Commando CT-5555 \"Fives\" went rogue and attempted to escape from Tipoca City, the clone trooper officer and other members of Kamino security pursued him and his medical droid companion AZI-3. The fugitive pair were attempting to investigate the cause of CT-5385's death, as Fives believed that the circumstances of Tup's passing were possibly linked to a conspiracy against the Republic. Led by Shaak Ti and accompanied by Nala Se, the clone officer was the first to find the fugitives as they boarded a Kaminoan flight pod and fled the city. The officer complied with Ti's order to track the pod but the Jedi Master soon sensed that all was not as it seemed and began to doubt that the fugitives' intentions were to leave the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The officer confirmed his superior's suspicions when he relayed to her that someone was accessing Jango Fett's genotype in the Genetic Records Hall. Ti told the security force to evacuate the hall quietly but Fives was nevertheless able to recognise that something was amiss. The officer, Ti, Se and security force clone troopers arrived at the hall but the fugitives escaped through an access hatch before they could be stunned and captured. Se then ordered the officer to station troops at all access points in the city's main hallway system that connected to the service tunnels the fugitives were travelling through. Later, the officer and the Jedi came to Nala Se's aid when she secretly confronted Fives and AZI-3 about their knowledge of the inhibitor chips in the Tipoca City embryo room. With dual DC-17 hand blasters at the ready, the officer warned the fugitives not to move and, in response, Fives positioned himself behind Se with a DC-15A blaster carbine pointed at her head. The renegade ARC trooper proceeded to relay the information and evidence he had acquired about the biochips to his pursuers. After listening intently, and in spite of Nala Se's protests, Ti decided it would be best for Fives and the evidence to travel to Coruscant so that Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine could be briefed on the situation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like all clones of the human male Jango Fett, the clone trooper officer stood at 1.83 meters tall.
