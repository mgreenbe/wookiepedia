The freighter was infiltrated by the rebels Saw Gerrera, Sabine Wren, Ezra Bridger, and the droid Chopper, who sabotaged the crystal causing it to destabilize. The rebels escaped as the crystal exploded, destroying the freighter and Slavin's Star Destroyer, killing Slavin and DT-F16's squad in the process."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
