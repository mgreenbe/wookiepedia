They were active during the last decades of the Galactic Republic. Many other criminal organizations wanted the Galactic Radicals eliminated, because the members often horned in on their activities, taking all the loot but never getting arrested. New members were recruited into the organization by Boozoo \"Bogey\" Boga, who hijacked bounty hunters and liberated their quarry. If the bounty chose to do so, they could join the Galactic Radicals. Otherwise, they were disposed of in short order, so as not to reveal the gang's location."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
