She damaged the troop carrier Sempre in order to bring the ship out of hyperspace in a location where the ship could be attacked and the Wookiee slaves it was carrying were freed. She also sabotaged the long-range comm system of the Lansend Twenty-Six preventing the station from alerting the nearby Baklek Base that was supposed to provide a rapid response if Lansend Twenty-Six needed assistance. Before Colonel Zenoc's troops could find and disarm her, she also managed to take out the starboard-side defenses of the space station which opened the station up for an attack. By the time Commodore Thrawn and the Chimaera arrived to the scene, the saboteur had been neutralized."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
