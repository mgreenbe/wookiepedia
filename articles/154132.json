The guard captured the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, disguised as Rako Hardeen, and tortured Kenobi for information about his two partners. They eventually struck a deal where Kenobi would reveal a tracking frequency code he had made sure was efficient, and in exchange Kenobi would be released. After the code was given up, it was told to another enforcer who was soon able to shoot down the starship containing Bane and Eval. On an inquiry of why Kenobi was still prisoner, the guard revealed that he had decided the deal would be off, and kept Kenobi incapacitated. In response, the disguised Jedi released himself unbeknownst to the guard, and soon rendered the Hutt enforcer unconscious."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This guard first appeared in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series episode, Friends and Enemies, which was released in 2012.
