The species had two sexes, male and female. The color of their skin ranged in variety from peachy tones to more ruddy hues. Many of them had brown spots of various sizes and shapes on certain parts of the body, including the cheeks, the forehead and the shoulders. Both sexes had hair on the top of the head and eyebrows, and the males could grow a beard. They were comparable in size to humans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Compared to spacefaring cultures, the inhabitants of Vyndal were low on the technology ladder. Their warriors used physical shields and pole weapons, as opposed to energy shield and blasters. They wore simple clothes with subdued, earthy tones, often decorated with triangular motifs. Their homes consisted of rectangular naves with vaulted ceilings and arch-shaped facades at both ends. The internal walls of their buildings were painted with brighter colors, and featured ornamental patterns consisting of repeated and symmetrical figures. The natives were capable of speaking Galactic Basic Standard, and they knew how to write, as shown by the existence of parchments. They also mastered pottery and were capable of crafting eyeglasses."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point following the rise of the Galactic Empire and the extermination of the Jedi Order, a village of Vyndal natives welcomed Yeleb, a human male who had landed on their homeworld. Some time later, Yeleb came back with a lightsaber he had found on the corpse of a dead Jedi who had also crashed on Vyndal, and the village chief appointed him the protector of his people. Many years later, a real Jedi named Kanan Jarrus was forced to land on Vyndal to repair his starship, and he made contact with the village. That new arrival attracted the Empire's chief Jedi hunter, the Grand Inquisitor, who came with two Gozanti-class cruisers and a contingent of stormtroopers. Yeleb fell to the Inquisitor's blows, but Jarrus helped the Vyndal natives fend off the Imperial attack. Deprived of their protector, the natives were forced to learn stand up for themselves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Vyndal natives first appeared in \"The fake Jedi,\" a 2015 comic strip written by Martin Fisher and illustrated by Bob Molesworth. The basic idea of Yeleb fooling a people who knew next to nothing about the Jedi came from Fisher, but the species' appearance and style was entirely chosen by Molesworth.\nAlthough the comic never stated it outright, Fisher confirmed that the species did hail from Vyndal. He also stated that he had not thought of a name for those natives, and offered the fan who asked him on Twitter to come up with one. Said fan ended up proposing \"Ghatoola,\" which Fisher approved of."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
