In respone, the Empire blockaded Daimar and as a result of the blockade, the people of Daimar began to starve. Mitar realized that he would eventually have to surrender, so he arranged for his grand-daughter Wilena, Senator Alet Komain and a small group of individuals that he didn't want to be captured by the Empire to leave Daimar in the starship Wasaka and run the blockade. However, just as the Wasaka attempted to flee the world, an Imperial-class Star Destroyer started to bombard the planet, while Imperial stormtroopers landed in Daimar's capital city and attacked the Daimar Royal Palace, Mitar's seat of power. The Wasaka engaged in combat with a number of TIE Fighters and entered hyperspace, successfully fleeing the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
