Konur participated in the Galactic Civil War, fighting for the Rebel Alliance against the Empire, and he served with distinction, attaining the rank of lieutenant in the Alliance Special Forces. After the death of Palpatine during the Battle of Endor, the Alliance was reformed into the New Republic, and Konur served in the newly created New Republic Special Forces. Circa 12 ABY, he learned of his ability to use the Force, and Borsk Fey'lya, a New Republic senator, advised Konur to enroll at the Jedi Praxeum, a Jedi academy on the moon Yavin 4 that was run by Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. Konur took Fey'lya's advice, joining Skywalker's Jedi Order and becoming a student at the Yavin 4 academy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Konur underwent Jedi training under Skywalker's tutelage, studying alongside students Kyp Durron, Corran Horn, Kam Solusar, and Tionne. Konur soon became disgusted that the Jedi weren't using their Force powers as weapons to end the war with the Empire, and he suggested to Skywalker that a Jedi strike team be sent on a mission to kill the Moff Council, the governing body of the Imperial Remnant, to leave the Empire leaderless and allow the New Republic to exploit the resulting chaos by sending in their forces to destroy the Imperial fleet. Skywalker stated that he couldn't support any plan involving assassination, and he asked Konur to reconsider. However, Konur began plotting to take matters into his own hands, and he planned to travel to Bastion, the Imperial capital world, and eliminate the Moff Council himself. He also started exploring Yavin 4's Sith temples, ancient monuments that had been constructed by the extinct Massassi species. Two months after his arrival at the academy, Konur stowed away aboard the Lightning Rod, the academy's supply ship, and departed Yavin 4. Using his Force abilities, Konur mind-tricked Peckhum, the ship's pilot, into flying the supply ship to the planet Ord Mantell."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rogue Jedi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On arrival on Ord Mantell, Konur made his way to the Mud Puddle cantina in search of the former smuggler Arthen Brutt. Brutt rented a warehouse on the planet Wayland in which he stored a number of Old Republic artifacts that he had recovered from Mount Tantiss, a former storehouse of Palpatine. Konur hoped to arm himself with some weapons from the collection and then travel to the Bilbringi system to obtain a suitable starship in which he could travel to Imperial Space. The renegade Jedi told Brutt that he was interested in helping to finance repairs to Brutt's starship in return for a share of the smuggler's profits and then mind-tricked Brutt into revealing the location of the warehouse, telling the smuggler that he would return to Ord Mantell in a few weeks. Suspecting that Skywalker would sent someone to find him, Konur attempted to delay any potential pursuers by mind-tricking the leader of a local gang of Mantellian Savrip hunters into believing that anyone who came to question Brutt was a New Republic official who was looking to stop their hunting. In addition, Konur performed a mind trick on the Mud Puddle's bartender so that the individual would place a personal ad in a Bilbringi news service if the Mantellian Savrip hunters came into conflict with a group of strangers, in order to inform Konur if there were people pursuing him. Konur additionally mind-tricked Peckhum and abandoned him in the Mud Puddle, erasing the man's memories of how he got there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Afterward, Konur traveled to the city of New Nystao on Wayland, in which Brutt's warehouse was located. Under the alias \"Streen,\" the name of another student at Skywalker's academy, Konur rented a warehouse within the same complex that was located directly next door. By being stealthy and using mind tricks, Konur was able to steal the keys to Brutt's facility from the building's caretaker, Flissar, and he searched the boxes and crates inside without being detected. Eventually, he found some crates containing Old Republic weaponry and a lightsaber that had previously belonged to a Jedi Knight. Unable to carry all of the weapons out of the warehouse complex undetected, Konur moved them to his rented warehouse and then returned later to collect them during normal business hours. Again using his \"Streen\" alias, Konur hired the shipping concern Hyperspeed Express to transport his stolen weapons crates to the Bilbringi Shipyards, his next destination, and he paid Hyperspeed with a cashier's check that he had drawn from a local account. He also mind-tricked the Noghri Hyperspeed employee Smekt to send an empty envelope to Bilbringi if anyone came to investigate his shipment, a warning that someone sent by Skywalker had tracked Konur to Wayland. Konur then traveled to the shipyards of Bilbringi and attempted to find a small freighter that had been registered with the Empire, which had controlled the system until the Battle of Bilbringi in 9 ABY, because such a ship could enter Imperial Space reasonably unchallenged. He soon discovered that such ships were not as common as they had been in the past, and he encountered difficulties in procuring one."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Yavin 4, Skywalker discovered some notes that Konur had written about his exploration of Yavin 4's Sith temples, leading the Jedi Master to suspect that his student had turned to the dark side of the Force. However, Skywalker realized that he couldn't pursue Konur by himself, because, if Skywalker got close, the former SpecForce trooper would sense the Jedi Master's presence in the Force and flee. Instead, Skywalker sent a group of Jedi-allied agents to find Konur and return the errant student to Yavin 4 unharmed.

Once his stolen weapons had arrived on Bilbringi, Konur hired the Sullustan dockworker Rian Vitt to deliver the cargo to Hangar Bay 631-D, where the ship was located. Konur used mind tricks to make both Lar-Quain and Vitt forget his identity. The rogue Jedi began preparing the craft for his planned mission, and he set up a number of traps inside the hangar bay to act as distractions if any Jedi-allied agents tried to capture him. The hangar consisted of three landing grids\u2014Grid 1, Grid 2, and Grid 3\u2014that could each be individually lowered fifty meters to a level of the shipyard that contained maintenance tunnels, and Konur mind-tricked all of the hangar bay's controllers to make them re-route command of the hangar controls to a remote he carried. Konur then placed four crates containing droideka battle droids in Grid 2 and primed the droids to activate if the crates were opened. Near them, Konur placed some barrels of liquid fuel, one of which had a thermal detonator attached to it, and he planned to detonate the device if the droids failed to activate. He also lowered Grid 3 to the maintenance tunnels level and set up four automated E-Web heavy repeating blasters, which he programmed to attack anyone except himself that used a weapon in their vicinity. In addition, he placed stun grenades with proximity fuses inside two nearby turbolifts, and he secured his lightsaber and the remote to his wrist using wire-cored synthecord to prevent anyone from using the Force to disarm him. With the traps set, Konur planned to used the grid controls to divide any groups of Jedi-allied agents that arrived and then allow the aggressors to attack him, causing the E-Web blasters to trigger and distract the attackers while Konur fled in the Firespray-31."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Konur began carrying out some work in the hangar's parts shop, and he enlisted the Human Tomer, an off-duty hangar controller, to start preparing the Firespray-31 for takeoff. The Jedi also mind-tricked Tomer so that the controller would identify himself as Konur if approached, to act as a distraction if any Jedi-allied agents arrived. While Konur didn't expect anyone to fall for the deception, because he and Tomer looked nothing alike, he hoped that Tomer would occupy anyone who approached the starship long enough for Konur to notice their arrival and use the hangar grid controls to divide their party."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The agents sent by Skywalker confronted Konur in the hangar bay, and the rogue Jedi succeeded in using the hangar grids to split up their party. He then spoke to them, offering to let them come with him to Bastion and end the Galactic Civil War. However, they refused his offer, and he engaged them in combat. After making it to the Firespray-31, Konur fled Bilbringi and headed for Imperial Space. En route, he was forced to divert his ship to avoid an Imperial task force that was marshaling between the worlds Agamar and Garqi in preparation for an attack on the planet Orinda.

Anyone who landed on Dathomir was taken away under the premise of being decontaminated against the non-existent disease and incarcerated. Konur fell for the deception when he landed on Dathomir and was imprisoned by the Empire. Although he escaped, he was captured by a group of Imperial troops and Nightsisters, Dathomiri Force witches who had formed an alliance with the Empire. Konur revealed his identity to them, claiming that he had fled Yavin 4 because the Jedi had tried to brainwash him. He also stated that he would aid the Empire in return if granted political asylum, hoping that, by helping the Imperials, he would be able to get close to the Moff Council. The rogue Jedi was eventually able to arrange a meeting with General Vit, an Imperial officer who was leading Project: Nightsaber, the Empire's effort to train Nightsisters and use them in the war against the New Republic. Vit had been trying to find someone with Jedi training and a grudge against the New Republic to head up the project but chose not to immediately take on Konur for the role, despite believing that Konur was sincere about wanting to help the Empire. Konur also tried to persuade Vit to give him a lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi-allied agents whom Konur had faced on Bilbringi tracked him to Dathomir and, along with the former Imperial Royal Guardsman Kir Kanos, launched an attack on a communications center that the Empire was using to control all communications on Dathomir.

However, Konur didn't want to wait for the New Republic and the Empire to work out a peace settlement, instead wanting the war to come to an end as soon as possible. As a result, he came to believe that it was acceptable to use the Force aggressively if doing so ended unnecessary bloodshed, and he could not understand why the Jedi didn't use the Force as a weapon to defeat the Empire and end the war. Luke Skywalker considered Konur to be his friend, but he disagreed with his student's ideas because Skywalker believed that Jedi could not condone the assassination of sentient beings, which Konur viewed as acceptable. However, Skywalker believed that Konur did not deserve to come to harm, because he thought that the former SpecForce trooper was just trying to end the war via the means that he knew best."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Konur entered the service of the Empire on Dathomir, he became obsessed with proving himself to Vit so that the General would grant him an audience with the Moff Council.
