Meanwhile on Coruscant, Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum managed to persuade the Galactic Senate to send four Navy attack groups to deal with the Yinchorr and to place a blockade the Yinchorri system though he had to make several promises to them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the Jedi arrived at Uhanayih. However, they were met by a massive Yinchorri fleet and soon under attack. Luckily for the Jedi, help came in the form of a Republic Navy fleet consisting of Republic light assault cruisers and armed Corellian Star Shuttles. Soon, much of the Yinchorri fleet had been destroyed or immobilized, allowing the Jedi to make their way to Uhanayih."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mace Windu then ordered Qui-Gon Jinn to contact the Admiral in charge of the Republic forces and request for an escort for their trip to the Yinchorri high command.
