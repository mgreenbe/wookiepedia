When the Millennium Falcon was being attacked by a swarm of stone mites, Han Solo rigged up conversion modules to connect the de-icing system to the main reactor, causing the hull to heat up enough to scorch off the mites. This quickly began to tax the conversion modules, and blew them out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
