The two Jedi fought a gundark in the cave, as Dooku escaped off planet with a group of Weequay pirates lead by Hondo Ohnaka.

The war was fought between the Galactic Republic and the still recently formed Confederacy of Independent Systems, which was led by a Head of State, Count Dooku. Dooku was a former member of the Jedi Order, but, sometime prior to the war, had secretly become a Sith Lord. Capturing Dooku became a major priority to the Republic and Jedi, as it would bring the Clone Wars to a quicker end."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 21 BBY, the Republic created a plan to capture the Count.

Afterward, Obi-Wan Kenobi would board to rescue Skywalker.

As Kenobi attempted to repair his lightsaber, which had been damaged by the falling rocks, one of the native gundarks found the Jedi and attacked Skywalker. Around this time Dooku retruned to his crash-site, however found that his ship was currently surrounded by a group of pirates. The pirates were busy raiding the two crashed ships and the leader of the pirate gang, Hondo Ohnaka approached the Count. Hondo complemented the Solar Sailer, and Dooku allowed the pirates to raid his craft. The pirate then offered Dooku off world, as long as he would pay the pirates, and the Count accepted deal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the cave, the pair of Jedi were able to use the force to blocking away with rocks, and began to try to find a way out of the cave. The Jedi then heard a second gundark, however Skywalker stated that it was too far away to be a problem. Another problem was added to their list however, when the two accidentally released toxic gas from an area in the cave. The two attempted to hold out, but both eventually collapsed due to the gas, but they were luckily saved by an explosion that opened the cave. This had came from Ahsoka and a group of clones, who had arrived to be the duo's reinforcements."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The explosion removed the threat of the gas, and the two Jedi reunited with Ahsoka by the Nu-class attack/transport shuttle they had arrived in, however she soon spotted a gundark running to attack the group, which was possibly the one Skywalker had claimed to be \"too far away.\" In response to this the clones shot at the rocks, again sealing the cave.

Hondo threatened the man whom he believed was a Jedi, but Dooku then revealed to Hondo that he was actually a Sith Lord, but Dooku was still outnumbered. The count was taken into the pirate's custody, so that he could be given away at a high ransom. Hondo contacted Supreme Chancellor Palpatine on Coruscant. Palpatine and several others spoke with Hondo via hologram, and the pirate stated that the Republic would have to pay one million credits in spice to get Dooku. Palpatine doubted the pirate's claims, however the pirate showed the Count's lightsaber, which Grand Master Yoda did recognize as Dooku's blade. Hondo also threatened that if the Republic did not agree to pay for Dooku, he would instead offer Dooku back to the Separatist Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala offered the idea that two Jedi could be sent to verify if Dooku truly was in their custody. Ohnaka agreed to these terms, but stated that the Jedi had to come unarmed.
