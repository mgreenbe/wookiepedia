Cad Bane hijacked a V-19 Torrent and got away with one of the hyperdrive rings after the Battle of Devaron. After escaping the exploding Munificent-class star frigate, Cad Bane sneaked aboard a Sheathipede-class transport shuttle disguised as Denal. After landing on the Resolute, he walked away only to be noticed by Ahsoka, that he was injured. He kicked her in the chest and ran for a V-19 Torrent starfighter then docked with the hyperdrive ring. For the V-19 to dock, the fighter had to fly into the ring and raise its hinged lower S-foils to link with the upper connector. The ring contained six nozzles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
