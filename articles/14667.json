The Yuuzhan Vong were preparing to move a number of ranking Galactic Alliance prisoners from Selvaris to Coruscant in preparation for a major sacrifice. The prisoners included a number of celebrated heroes and resistance leaders, including Pash Cracken and Judder Page, whose continuing operations were deemed needed to continue the war effort. The Galactic Alliance launched a surprise rescue operation using information from Thorsh, a Selvaris escapee, yet were only partially successful."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
