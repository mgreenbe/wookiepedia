Among her many contributions to the Jedi Order during her years of service was her authorship of several chapters of the Temple guidebook titled, The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force. Writing down her knowledge of the history of the Jedi and Sith Orders as well as codifying the regulations of the Jedi Trials, Master Quist left a lasting impression on future generations through her words."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A survivor of the New Sith Wars, Quist was made a Jedi Master and offered the position of Caretaker of First Knowledge. Eager to pass reform and encourage advanced studies at the academy, Quist eagerly accepted the offer, taking her seat at the head of the Council of First Knowledge, serving beside such famed Masters as the Ithorian Obba."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon her appointment as the Chief Librarian of the Jedi Archives on Coruscant, Quist immediately began attempting to bring to light the lack of focus that had plagued the students at the academy. Replacing Barra-Rona-Ban, Quist swiftly began implementing reform. Believing that the Archives were the source of all wisdom, Quist stated that her colleagues would not be where they were if it weren't for their study in the vast Stacks. Like many Jedi, Quist was confident that the Sith had been defeated during the Seventh Battle of Ruusan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When her fellow Masters proposed that a guidebook to the life of the Jedi be written, Master Quist was quick to pen five chapters in hopes that she could pass down her strict view on the necessity of study to future generations of Jedi. Describing the Second Pillar of the Jedi: Knowledge, Quist urged study in the Archives and throughout the Temple, as the entire complex was filled with history and demonstrations of the Living Force. Writing down the rules and regulations of the Jedi Trials as head of the Academy, Quist pointed out how the tests had evolved over the years and formalized during the time of peace known as the Golden Age of the Old Republic. Another contribution was a detailed analysis of other Force-using organizations, which painted clearly Master Quist's belief that all Force-users should join the Jedi Order, and if they weren't already a member they should be persuaded to convert through diplomacy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While it did not make it into the finished edition, Daniel Wallace, author of The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force, released a list detailing the genders and species of each of the authors of the in-universe The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force.
