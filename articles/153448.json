Hondo wanted to board the Jedi ship Crucible in order to steal the lightsaber crystals that were on board.

To get rid of the pirates, Ahsoka Tano ordered trainee Zatt to activate the re-powered engines and break apart from the pirate vessel. This caused a vacuum which proceeded to suck all of the pirates, this one included, out of the Crucible. While most of the pirates were unlucky and sucked into space, this pirate, along with Hondo, Gwarm, and several others managed to grab hold of part of the pirate shuttle's connecting bridge. In the end, Ahsoka was captured by the pirates and the Crucible blasted off into hyperspace, unaware that Ahsoka was not on board."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This pirate was designed by Chris Glenn according to Star Wars.com's concept art gallery.
