It aimed to create sleeper operatives using cybernetics. Said operatives would then be spread throughout the galaxy, embedding themselves within cities and spying on citizens on the Security Bureau's behalf. Since the project itself was meant to be implemented on the desert planet of Er'Kit, the Empire hired the mercenaries of the Malachor Company to brutally relocate the native people. Even as the first wave of sleeper operatives was nearly ready to be released, Commander Luke Skywalker of the enemy Rebel Alliance discovered the Imperial presence on Er'Kit and, with the help of a Rebel agent, put an end to Project Hidden Eye."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
