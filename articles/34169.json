It is difficult to tell which account is canon; the account in this book takes place through a dream vision given to Kyle Katarn as he is knocked unconscious. He sees the events from the perspective of the human Jedi Tal, who was close to General Hoth. Tal is not mentioned in Path of Destruction, which details the events of the battle in its present day. Notably, in this book the thought bomb is prepared by Kaan's Brotherhood in advance of the Army of Light's arrival, and the scene takes place in a valley. In the other, it takes place deep in a cave and the bomb was simultaneously created and detonated. The Jedi happen to enter the cave just as the bomb is about to be detonated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This is a gallery of the different cover variations of Dark Forces: Jedi Knight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
