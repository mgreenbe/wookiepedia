SCAR Squadron, led by Sergeant Kreel, used the Sentinel-class landing craft to travel to the moon Hubin, where prominent Rebel Alliance members Leia Organa, Luke Skywalker, and Han Solo, were in hiding; the squad had learned of their location after capturing and interrogating rebel associate and smuggler Sana Starros aboard the shuttle. During a skirmish on the moon, the shuttle was stolen by the rebels, who used it to escape Hubin along with the resident Clan Markona, led by Thane Markona's daughter, Tula. The rebels traveled in the Sentinel-class landing craft to the Imperial Impound Yard on Novka, where Starros' starship, Volt Cobra, had been taken. After crashing the shuttle through a control tower, the rebels escaped aboard the Volt Cobra while Markona and her clan commandeered another vessel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A shuttle, the Sentinel-class landing craft was equipped with engines and a hyperdrive. The starship also possessed a transponder that could be damped to obscure its identity. Able to be flown by one pilot and a navigator, the shuttle could accommodate a number of passengers.

In around 1 ABY, the squad used the shuttle to pursue the smuggler Sana Starros, who had been transporting the rebels Leia Organa, Luke Skywalker, and Han Solo, as well as the droids C-3PO and R2-D2, through the Dene Gois Cluster aboard her starship, Volt Cobra; though Starros had dropped the rebels off in an escape pod on the moon Hubin, SCAR Squadron caught her attempting to evade an Imperial Star Destroyer.

Upon landing, they were greeted by Thane Markona, who led them back to his estate while trooper Aero secured the ship. The squad intended to capture the rebels and take them to their shuttle, but Markona, citing the tradition of Hubin and the fact that the rest of the clan would retaliate and prevent the stormtroopers from returning to their ship if they harmed him or the settlement, instead arranged a duel between Kreel and Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Escape and destruction"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the duel was a ruse; Markona, having tested his rebel guests during their time on Hubin, intended to assist them in escaping alongside the residents of the moon. While Markona held off the troopers of SCAR Squadron, his daughter, Tula, led Clan Markona and the rebels to the Imperial shuttle. R2-D2 sliced into the entry hatch, allowing the members of Clan Markona to board with their belongings. The rebels boarded the Sentinel-class landing craft, with Solo piloting the vessel. SCAR Squadron, having killed Markona, noticed that their shuttle had been stolen as it departed Hubin, stranding the troopers on the moon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aboard the shuttle, Solo declared himself the captain, asking Starros to navigate. Starros, however, first located and destroyed the torture droid. Wishing to regroup with the rest of the Rebellion, the rebels intended to retrieve the Volt Cobra, which had been taken to the Imperial Impound Yard on Novka. As the shuttle approached the impound yard, an Imperial Navy Trooper monitoring from a control tower identified the vessel as SCAR Squadron's by its transponder and requested that they broadcast that day's clearance code.

As Imperial forces began to fire upon the vessel's boarding ramp, Tula and Clan Markona disembarked and fought their way through the troops, with the rebels following them out of the shuttle.
