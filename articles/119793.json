Its role as an armed and armored hospital ship was instrumental in the effort to curb losses during the Clone Wars. Just before the Battle of the Kaliida Nebula in 21 BBY, the Sanctuary III was one of several in a convoy of Pelta-class frigates sent from the planet Naboo to assist in the transportation of wounded clone troopers from the Republic's Kaliida Shoals Medical Center before the Haven-class medical station could be destroyed by the approaching Separatist warship Malevolence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Built by Kuat Drive Yards, the Galactic Republic's Sanctuary III was a red, white, and yellow-colored Pelta-class frigate marked with red stripes on its upper-starboard and lower-port auxiliary wings to uniquely identify it, unlike the more commonly symmetrical striped wings of other Pelta-class frigates. Proprietary to the Republic, the ship was not available for sale to outside organizations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, protection as well as medical attention was required for wounded clone troopers as they healed. The Sanctuary III was well-suited to the task, as it was not only well armored, but could also withstand a sudden ambush. Though not able to inflict a great amount of damage, the Sanctuary III's turbolaser batteries were capable of delivering more firepower than a normal ship of its size. Although maneuverability with its sublight drive was poor\u2014despite its variable wing auxiliary engines\u2014the hospital ship was equipped to evade enemy attacks with a deflector shield generator rated higher than others of its class and a hyperdrive that propelled it through hyperspace. In addition, maintenance droids and fire control systems helped effect repairs to battle damage in a timely fashion, thus keeping the medical frigate operational and its clone trooper patients alive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 21 BBY, the Sanctuary III participated in a convoy of at least four Pelta-class frigates sent from the planet Naboo to evacuate stabilized wounded clone patients from the Republic's Haven-class medical station, the Kaliida Shoals Medical Center. This operation was time-sensitive due to the imminent arrival of the Separatist warship Malevolence, a Subjugator-class heavy cruiser. Armed with two giant ion pulse cannons capable of wiping out entire fleets, the heavy cruiser\u2014under the command of the Confederate General Grievous\u2014was on its way to destroy the medical station from which the Sanctuary III and its sister ships were evacuating the clones. The Sanctuary III completed its part of the mission and was gone from the facility before the arrival of the Malevolence, which was ultimately destroyed by Republic forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before its appearance in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series episode \"Shadow of Malevolence,\" which aired on October 10, 2008, the Sanctuary III was previewed earlier in October 2008 as a miniature in the Clone Wars Tactics expansion of the Star Wars PocketModel TCG collection, which was later released on November 12, 2008."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
