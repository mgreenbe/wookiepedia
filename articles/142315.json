The trooper brought Dameron into Hangar Six under the pretense of escorting the prisoner and then hurriedly boarded one of the TIE/sf space superiority fighters in Bay Two of the hangar.

The trooper then turned the turret on the control room, shattering the windows in an explosion and throwing Thanisson from his seat while Kaplan and the other officers present tried to cower away from the blast. Once Dameron managed to disconnect the support cabling, the fighter escaped from the Finalizer and headed for Jakku, but was shot down by the battlecruiser en route and crashed on the planet's surface."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thanisson first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in North America on December 18, 2015.
