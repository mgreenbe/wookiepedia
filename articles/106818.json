After wandering through the Void for some time, all the members of the unit eventually made it to Pons Ora, with the astromech droids, led by R2-D2, reaching the city long before Zilkin Colonel Meebur Gascon and DUM-series pit droid WAC-47. After regrouping, Gascon sent the astromechs to scout the town, while he went to get food for himself. Gascon chose the Power Sliders diner, but he and WAC were chased out by Borkus after he loudly announced himself as a Republic officer, in part because Borkus did not want them to see Gregor. However, at WAC's suggestion, Gascon went around to the back to dumpster-dive for food and encountered the amnesiac clone anyways, who was deeply confused by the duo's insistence that he was a soldier."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
