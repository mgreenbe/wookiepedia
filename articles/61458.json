Later, in 0 BBY, Hija participated in the Devastator's capture of the Rebel CR90 corvette Tantive IV, during which he spotted an escape pod fleeing from the impounded Rebel vessel.

After hearing Bolvan's report on an accident in a biological research facility and the following spread of a flesh-eating bacterium across Falleen's surface, Vader ordered an orbital bombardment of the surface to halt any further spread of the leaking bioweapon. Hija was responsible for firing the devastating turbolaser bombardment from the Devastator that destroyed the weapons facility and everything within forty kilometers to cover up the mishap.

After Rebel agents transmitted the stolen plans of the first Death Star, a new Imperial superweapon, to the Rebel CR90 corvette Tantive IV, Senator Leia Organa's consular ship, the Devastator pursued and captured the Rebel vessel over the planet Tatooine. Several escape pods were jettisoned from the Tantive IV during the battle. Hija spotted the pod that, unbeknownst to the Imperials, contained the Rebel droids C-3PO and R2-D2, the latter of whom carried the stolen Death Star plans in his memory banks. However, since the Devastator's gunnery sensors detected no lifeforms within the escape pod, Bolvan ordered Hija to hold his fire in order to conserve power, allowing the droids to escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Darth Vader ordered Hija to conduct the orbital bombardment of Falleen that would kill thousands, the lieutenant did not hesitate and carried out his duties at once.
