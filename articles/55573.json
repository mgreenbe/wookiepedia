At some point in his life, Gorga became the leader of the Desilijic clan\u2014along with Jabba\u2014and earned a position on the Hutt Ruling Council. Despite being Jabba's nephew, Gorga's voice was given equal measure on matters brought before the council though it was not as weighty as Jabba's."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime during or prior to the Clone Wars, Gorga established a black market operation on the planet Nothoiin, which lasted for years and brought Gorga huge profits."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Time in the Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, the Hutt Ruling Council hired Cad Bane to hunt for Ziro the Hutt, due to his possession of potentially damaging information about Hutt activities.

As he made his way down the main street, Gorga smirked as he saw several of the locals being harassed by the Nikto guards the Hutts employed. Once again, Gorga passed by a disguised Obi-Wan Kenobi, this time pretending to be the wanted bounty hunter Rako Hardeen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A year later, Darth Maul, Savage Opress, and Pre Vizsla of the Death Watch came to the Hutt Council Chamber in a Hutt Palace to form an alliance with the elder Hutts. Maul asked for Hutt territories and everything in it's borders, in exchange for the Hutts' lives. They merely laughed, and Jabba sent bounty hunters after them. While Gorga and Jabba were seen as holograms, the other Hutts, except for Oruba, escaped. Gorga was later seen with Jabba at his uncle's palace, when Maul and company launched an attack on Jabba's palace. Gorga watched as his uncle was forced to join the Collective."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime later, the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems brought the Clone Wars to Nothoiin, ending in a Republic victory, which resulted in Gorga going out of business. Gorga then hired several Trandoshans mercenaries, nicknamed Team Dosho, and a bounty hunter named Zatch. The bounty hunters disguised themselves as Nothoiins and stole Nothoiin swoops. Gorga then had the Trandoshans attack the captured Separatist Heavy Speeder carrying Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Gorga soon contacted the Jedi Generals and told them that he was trying to cause a civil war on Nothoiin to bring back his business to the planet. However, Zatch was soon defeated and the Jedi rammed their speeder into Gorga's vehicle. Gorga was then arrested by the Jedi and taken to a Republic prison."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime later, Gorga was freed from prison and traveled to the base of the Pyke Syndicate on Oba Diah.

However, Gizman and Spiker, former Swoop riders for Jabba, reached the vessel first and took off. They were waylaid briefly by a security holotape, giving one of Gorga's armed freighters a chance to catch up. In an effort to lighten the vessel's load and escape, as well as strike back at Gorga (whom they suspected had something to do with the tape triggering), Gizman and Spiker flew low and threw Jabba's priceless collection of Mendacian Funeral Urns at the Hutt. The loss of one of the most valuable treasures aboard the ship horrified Gorga."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Hiring Boba Fett"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While on Tatooine, a Hutt named Anachro caught Gorga's eye.

Fett succeeded, and Gorga, Anachro, and Orko celebrated Gorga and Anachro's impending nuptials by eating Bar-Kooda's corpse."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While on his honeymoon, slavers kidnapped Anachro on Skeebo, causing Gorga to hire Fett to get her back.

However, Gorga soon found his father-in-law insufferable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He hired Fett to assassinate Orko, but asked him to make it look accidental, so that Anachro's suspicions were not aroused. However, when he learned that Anachro was pregnant, he ordered the assassination called off. Unfortunately, Ry-Kooda, Bar-Kooda's brother, had murdered Orko in a particularly brutal fashion. Anachro accused Gorga of the murder, and in grief went back to her father's. Ry-Kooda attacked Anachro's transport, but Gorga stopped him, and Boba Fett ultimately killed Ry-Kooda. The turmoil of the event caused Anachro to give birth."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Profitable business ventures"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boba Fett's charges put Gorga in debt for two years, but his shrewd business skills paid off.
