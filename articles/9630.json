Made up of the three Tunroth Hunters of highest rank, it dealt with issues that concerned all Tunroth, such as the need to deal with an external threat, alleviate overcrowding or colonize new worlds. The Assemblage of Three advocated the simultaneous colonization of Saloch and Kalok, which, together with the original homeworld of Jiroch-Reslia, became known as the Triumvirate in recognition of the vital role the Assemblage played."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
