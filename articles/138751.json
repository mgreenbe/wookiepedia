Following the rescue, within the Death Star's Central Core Shaft, the Princess, along with another member of the group, Luke Skywalker, found themselves behind a blast door leading to a shaft. Skywalker had unknowingly disabled the controls to a bridge meant to extend across the shaft, and as the two were trapped on a narrow overhang, TK-875 was part of a trio of stormtroopers who exchanged blaster fire with them from a higher overhang across the shaft. Eventually, Skywalker and Organa managed to swing across the shaft with the use of a grappling hook, evading TK-875's blaster fire.

Skywalker escorted Organa to Docking Bay 327, the hangar bay that the group arrived in aboard the YT-1300 light freighter Millennium Falcon. Going through the station's corridors on the way to the hangar, the pair were spotted by a stormtrooper patrol, and were forced to take cover behind a blast door leading to the Death Star's Central Core Shaft. Attempting to prevent the stormtroopers from opening the door, Skywalker used his stolen stormtrooper E-11 blaster rifle to shoot the control panel by the door, unknowingly destroying the controls meant for a bridge to go across the chasm. As Skywalker and Organa were stuck on a narrow overhang, TK-875 was part of a trio of stormtroopers who arrived on a higher overhang across the pair, firing their E-11 blaster rifles at the Alliance operatives. Skywalker fired back, hitting one of the troopers, TK-119, who fell down the shaft. As Skywalker prepared to swing across the chasm with the grappling hook in his stolen stormtrooper utility belt, Organa exchanged fire with TK-875 and the third stormtrooper, eventually killing the latter.
