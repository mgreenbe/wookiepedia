Their claws and teeth were diamond-hard, allowing them to dig prey out of formations of basaltic rock. Their barbed tails and saliva contained a venom that marked their prey, allowing them to unswervingly track it for up to a month after contact. Their coloration ranged from dark brown to green."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the wild, nashtahs often outsmarted or outlasted animals with greater size, speed, or viciousness. The first survey teams to the world were wiped out by Dra III's native life, but eventually a team escaped the world alive with several dead nashtahs, and subsequently the creatures became the most studied lifeform from the world. Some prominent criminals used Dravian hounds as guard animals despite the fact they are as likely to attack their masters as protect them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The slavers Magg and Zlarb used nashtahs in their slaving operations, including one on Lur.
