The hunters, riding speeder bikes, opened fire on the Jedi, killing some and setting fire to the surrounding forest. During the fight, T'ra Saa's lightsaber was knocked from her hand and collected by one of the hunters, who ultimately fled the encroaching fires. Left with no alternative against the blaze, Saa used the Force to pull trees down over the survivors, effectively trapping them away from the flames."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A rainstorm soon doused the fires, and Mace Windu arrived on the scene to rescue the survivors.

The Jedi Healer informed Windu of the details of the unexpected battle, and the Jedi Master resolved to put an end to the Crimson Nova's activities with a mission to the Rig, their base of operations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Separatists presumably retained control of Null after the Jedi were forced to abandon their position."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
