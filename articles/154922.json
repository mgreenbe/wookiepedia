The guard was stationed at the Dai Bendu monastery during the Kijimi summit, in which Zeva Bliss, leader of the Spice Runners, intended to gather and execute numerous criminal figures. Poe Dameron, a Spice Runner who had worked out Bliss's plan and intended to prevent it, encountered the guard, requesting weapons from the armory. The guard returned with a case of weapons, and Dameron thanked him, claiming to promise to report his assistance to Bliss. The guard attempted to contain his excitement at the prospect, and was sent back to his post by Dameron, who used the case of weapons to help the criminal prisoners overthrow their guards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
