Although the thundering footfalls of the walkers was enough to tell him that the Imperial invasion force was close, with a shock of recognition, Callum confirmed the presence of around a dozen approaching All Terrain Armored Transports through his TD2.3 electrobinoculars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Callum reported back to Station 3-T-8 to verify his visual confirmation of the AT-ATs, which also broadcast throughout Echo Base, first announcing the extent of the Imperial ground force. Callum also issued a comlink warning to Rogue Leader Luke Skywalker, in command of Echo Base's snowspeeders, of the approaching walkers. Soon after reporting his sighting, however, Callum was killed in the opening barrage of AT-AT laser cannon fire.

During the film scene in which the Rebels first spot the AT-ATs on Hoth, the radio drama is alternatively set within the Echo Base command center, and the reports are heard over comlink. The command center receives a call directly from Echo Station 3-T-8, and General Carlist Rieekan subsequently opens up communication with a young soldier, identified only as \"Outpost Beta,\" who nervously describes the giant size of the walkers, which Rieekan in turn confirms are AT-ATs. This young soldier is, in fact, Maren Kelsome, as confirmed by Galaxy Guide 3, and, again, should not be confused with Callum, who is the third link in the chain of comlink calls from Kelsome and Echo Station 3-T-8."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Likewise, Callum should not be confused with a character narrative appearing in \"Chapter Six: Ground Combat\" from the 1990 first edition and 1994 second edition of the West End Games Rebel Alliance Sourcebook. The chapter introduction describes how \"the advance scout on Echo Base's North Ridge [who was] the first to see the walkers\" goes on to rescue a downed snowspeeder pilot once the last AT-AT passes his position. This description may also seem to correspond to Maren Kelsome; however, any connection to either character represents a stark continuity inconsistency, since both Callum and Kelsome are dead by this point in the battle."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Inconsistencies"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back PhotoComic, a 2008 comic book adaptation using still images from the film, includes Trey Callum's scene announcing the approaching AT-AT walkers.

Similarly, the \"Walker Sighting\" card from the Hoth Limited SWCCG expansion set includes the quote \"Echo station, 3TA. We have spotted Imperial walkers,\" a corruption of Callum's actual spoken line from the film."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, released in 2008, uses the same production photo of a Hoth Rebel soldier from The Empire Strikes Back to illustrate both Trey Callum and Hoth soldier Rey\u00e9 Hollis.
