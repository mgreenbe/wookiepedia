During the Civil War it was one of the most common air rifles on the market, selling for 1100 and earning the name Sandman due to the subduing effects of its standard ammunition; tiny tranquilizer darts. The spin-stabilized darts had laser-honed tips and were capable of piercing the thickest of hide. They were stored in detachable clips which were easy and quick to reload. The darts could also be upgraded for 500 to contain \"SmartTranq\" tranquiliser which contained an active ingredient which could adapt to the targets bloodstream to be as effective as possible. The light-weight polycarbonate gun had fibermesh reinforcements, a long barrel, and was similar in size and shape to a sporting blaster. Model 77s were marketed as non-lethal weapons for use in animal control or law enforcement. The guns had a reputation for being reliable and accurate, and were commonly used by big-game hunters and bounty hunters to subdue live prey throughout the Outer Rim Territories."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Model 77 was first mentioned in Enter the Unknown, a sourcebook written by Sterling Hershey and released in 2013 for Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
