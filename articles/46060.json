This form of punishment was known to be practiced by the Jedi Order against members who went against the will of the Order or turned to the dark side. Not all cases of exile were a form of punishment, as any being could place themselves in a self-imposed exile for a wrong they perceived they had done, removing themselves from society to keep them from wronging another again, or for failing a task they had believed they should have accomplished."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Examples of exile"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Groups who used exile as punishment"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
