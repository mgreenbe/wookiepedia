During the Clone Wars, she and several of her fellow sisters confronted the wounded Asajj Ventress, a former Nightsister who had been betrayed by Count Dooku. She, along with the other members of her clan, prepared to execute Ventress, only to be stopped by Talzin, who informed them that Ventress was one of their own. Soon afterward, Talia helped prepare the Water of Life to revive Ventress. She also helped prepare an invisibility magic potion for Ventress and her fellow Nightsisters Karis and Naa'leth to use in an infiltration of Count Dooku's palace. After this attempt failed, she was present when Ventress and her sisters returned in their ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Talia attended Count Dooku's arrival at the Nightsister fortress.
