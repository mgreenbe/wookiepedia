Around five years before the Battle of Yavin, the Mandalorian artist and demolitions expert Sabine Wren came to possess a pile of delta clay, which she kept in the corner of her cabin on board the starship Ghost while trying to decide what to use it for. Wren managed to get some of the clay on her nose and cheeks, where it dried and remained for two days. Wren wrote about the clay in her journal, where she claimed to love having the dried clay on her face."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Delta clay was first mentioned in Sabine My Rebel Sketchbook, a reference book written by Daniel Wallace and published in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
