One gushaz was located in the City of Kastays. Thousands of years before the Galactic Civil War, the Aaris discovered the Plaque of Victory on their world and placed it in the city's gushaz. However, the Plaque was a sentient, inanimate lifeform bound inside a metal ingot. It sought to destroy those individuals around it by manipulating their personalities, making them more violent and paranoid. Eventually, the Plaque's influence came to affect the entire city, and violence erupted among the population. The Plaque was removed from the gushaz by one of the factions fighting in the city and taken to the tower of a local scholar, Kastays, where it was hoped that the Plaque's influence would be negated if it was high above the city. The plan failed, and the planet descended into a civil war, which led to the downfall of the Aaris civilization."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 8 ABY, an Imperial archaeological expedition to Aaris III uncovered Kastays' tower and the Plaque of Victory. Grigor Tansad, a scientist on the team, translated several pictographs on the chamber's walls left by Kastays describing the events surrounding the Plaque of Victory's arrival in the city. Tansad found reference to the gushaz, but the exact translation of the term was unclear to him. He knew it was a place of reverence but was unsure if the gushaz was a temple or a palace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The gushaz was first mentioned in the RPG adventure Artifact of Aaris, published in The DarkStryder Campaign by West End Games in 1995."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
