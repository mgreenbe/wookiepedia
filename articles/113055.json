He was stationed aboard the Coronet to protect Duchess Satine Kryze from assassination attempts. While he was in the cargo bay, he, R2-D2, and fellow trooper Mixer were attacked by assassin probes; he was killed first when an assassin probe snuck up behind him and choked him with its metallic legs. Before Mixer could alert others aboard Coronet of the probes and Redeye's death, he was killed. Later, the probe used his body as a decoy to fool Anakin, but he realized Redeye wasn't alive; the assassin probe then tossed his body at Anakin, which hit a crate and was last seen limp on a box in the cargo bay."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cloned on the water world of Kamino from the DNA of Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett.
