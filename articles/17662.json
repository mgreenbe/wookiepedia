It was used to protect mining ships such as the Omen and the Harbinger. They were very fast and maneuverable, though they lacked hyperdrives and shields, very similar to the TIE fighters used by the Galactic Empire nearly five thousand years later. They were also piloted by Force-sensitive pilots, possibly even Sith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
