Force-sensitive, Numa and Alema Rar were eventually discovered by passing Jedi Knight Daeshara'cor, who took the two young Twi'lek women under her tutelage, and later traveled with them to Yavin 4, where Rar was trained at the Jedi Praxeum."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Yuuzhan Vong War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 25 ABY, when the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong invaded the galaxy, the New Jedi Order was mobilized to engage the threat. Several months into the war, Daeshara'cor was struck down at the Battle of Ithor. Numa Rar wished to honor the memory of her fallen protector by continuing in what she saw as a noble battle, but her actions came under the scrutiny of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, especially once the Rar sisters became partisan leaders on New Plympto, a planet occupied by the invaders. Conducting an aggressive campaign against the Yuuzhan Vong present on the planet, Rar isolated herself and her sister from the New Jedi Order as the invasion wore on. She nevertheless tried to enlist aid from those who were willing to help, receiving supplies from the maverick Jedi Kyp Durron, and later traveling to Shelter, a Jedi base in The Maw, in a futile attempt to gain funds and war mat\u00e9riel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the success of Numa and Alema Rar's resistance movement encouraged the Yuuzhan Vong to wipe out all life on the planet, forcing the native Nosaurians and thousands of refugees off the planet. Rar and her sister hid among a fleet of intrasystem ore miners, along with many others fleeing New Plympto's devastation. Rescued by the Corellian cruiser Nebula Chaser, and promised safe asylum by its captain, Pollux, Numa Rar and her sister planned to return to the New Jedi Order. In an uncharted star system, however, the Nebula Chaser was intercepted by a Yuuzhan Vong frigate, and boarded by a search party, who demanded to know if Jedi were present aboard the starship. Pollux lied to protect the Rar sisters, but the presence of a Jedi-hunting voxyn among the search party brought an end to the charade. Unable to conceal her presence in the Force, Numa Rar led her sister in a doomed attempt to flee the creature, which doggedly tracked them through the cruiser. Confronted in the escape pod launch bay by the voxyn, Numa Rar was hit in the face by a blast of potent acid, which burned into her skull and killed her. Rar died in her sister's arms."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Numa's death was a source of permanent grief and anger to Alema, whose fall to the dark side of the Force was a long and drawn out process. When Alema was trapped on Tenupe between 36 ABY and 40 ABY, she had hallucinations that she and Numa were on Yavin 4, exploring the jungles. In 44 ABY, Grand Master Luke Skywalker glimpsed Rar in the Lake of Apparitions while seeking his deceased wife Mara Jade Skywalker, but did not stop to talk with her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
