Most of the hull was used to transport passengers, with the cockpit protruding on the back. A ramp could be extended rearward of the ship to give access to the passenger compartment, sheltered by an armored door. To protect itself, the shuttle was equipped with two twin laser turrets: one in the front of the ship, right under the nose; and one on the back, right in front of the cockpit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One shuttle delivered new recruits to the planet Ord Mantell during the Separatist War, and another shuttle was used by the Republic archaeological team that explored the planet Athiss.
