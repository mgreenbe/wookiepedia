He served as a guard in the Alliance to Restore the Republic and was stationed aboard the Home One Star Cruiser immediately after the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY. The Gotal guarded the hatchway of a meeting room in which the Rebels Mon Mothma, Crix Madine and Luke Skywalker watched a hologram from Bakura detailing an invasion by the Ssi-ruu species. When Skywalker exited the meeting, the Gotal saluted, but also flinched; his cone-shaped perceptor horns reacted to Skywalker's Force-sensitivity with a buzzing sensation inside the Gotal's head."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Author Kathy Tyers created this Gotal for her novel, The Truce at Bakura, published by Bantam Spectra in 1994."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
