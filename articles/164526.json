The plot outline is offered as an example of a quest-type adventure. The players are supposed to take the role of the spacers who recover the droid, but two variants of the adventure offer alternatives. In one, the player characters are agents of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, their mission on the world to recover the StelProbe V for the Alliance to analyze. Alternately, a reactor problem in the droid might be headed for an overload, a catastrophe that would kill off many Uroths. Finally, the player characters may face not only hostile Uroths, but also rival droid hunters on Wizar II.."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
