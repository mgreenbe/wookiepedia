After the Battle of Yavin, LIN-34 served Jabba the Hutt's criminal empire on Tatooine under Jabba's sadistic EV-series supervisor droid EV-9D9. Circa 1 ABY, BD-34 and three other droids, R3-B57, RA-316 and BD-34, escaped Jabba's Palace. EV-9D9 thus hired a spacer to track down the droids. Jabba's enemies of the Ay'Nat pirates assigned an AEG-77 Vigo yacht and an escort of X-wing starfighters to exfiltrate LIN-34 out of the Tatooine system. However, the yacht transporting LIN-34 was destroyed by Jabba's pilots, along with its escort."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "LIN-34 was mentioned in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
