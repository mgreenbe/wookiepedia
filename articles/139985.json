Circa 1 ABY, she met a spacer who was trying to acquire an Old Republic droid module from Stonewall Labs. She accepted to build a sequencer that can be used in a Stonewall Labs security beacon for Professor Zanier Hudmasse. She tasked the spacer to find three component: an XJ5 circuit board, some fractal transmitters, and some octave regulators. The spacer first acquired an XJ5 circuit board from Mummer scientists in the Mummer Cave. The spacer then found fractal transmitters in old data terminals in the Dee'ja Peak junkyard. The spacer finally got octave regulators from Skaak Tipper machinists in the Skaak Tipper Cave. Tanoa Vills later requested the spacer to investigate a shuttle that just crashed in the Gallo Mountains. She needed the spacer to eliminate rabid narglatches, including Grizzlefur, that gathered at the crash site in order to salvage research equipment. However, the Darkwalkers plundered the crash site before. Vills thus asked the spacer to raid the Darkwalker Cave nearby to recover a stolen bio-scanner. When the spacer returned to her, Tanoa Vills gave the completed sequencer requested by Professor Hudmasse to the spacer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tanoa Vills appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
