It remained in the shape of a long rapier-like weapon until snapped by its user into a whip-like weapon. In its whip form, an electro-plasma current ran through it. It could be wound around an opponent like a chain to hold him or her still, or could strike someone like a traditional whip, and was resistant to lightsaber strikes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bilari electro-chain whip was one of the most unique weapons in the Elite Praetorian Guard arsenal, able to function as a sword-like melee weapon with an electro-plasma current or be shifted into a whip depending on combat style. It could also be used to ensnare an opponent's weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 34 ABY, two members of the Elite Praetorian Guard carried their Bilari electro-chain whips aboard Snoke's flagship, the Supremacy, when General Armitage Hux and Kylo Ren of the First Order went to talk with Snoke about their failure. Sometime later, when Ren took the Force-sensitive scavenger Rey to Snoke, the Praetorian Guards used their whips along with their other weapons to combat Rey and Ren after the latter killed Snoke. Their whips were no match for Rey's and Kylo's lightsabers, resulting in the deaths of all the guards. One of the Bilari whip-wielding guards nearly overwhelmed Rey by ensnaring her lightsaber blade and drawing her in, but she freed herself and killed the guard while Ren beheaded the other after a brief duel, causing it to light a fire on the red banners."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
