Engineers built the ASP-9 specifically  to hunt vrelts: large, hairless rodents that scurried and hopped around on two large hind legs, and scavenged for crops and were known to even gnaw on sleeping campers. The ASP-9 fired slugs in short bursts to improve the odds of hitting the evasive creatures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because the ASP-9 was so readily available, was easy to conceal, and had a high rate of fire, it was a favorite of swoop gangs and street toughs across the Corellian system. It was not uncommon for CorSec inspectors to be called to crime scenes with slug-riddled bodies in the back alleys of Coronet City's Blue Sector or the slums of Dearic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
