The Numm feared CZ-4, the droid Han and Chewie were tasked with delivering as a gift from Boonda to Jabba Desilijic Tiure. After CZ-4's disappearance, the duo discovered the Numm's fear of droids resulted from a band of Krath war droids which had terrorized them since the droids crashed on the Numm's world centuries ago. The war droids' leader, known as the Blade Master, abducted CZ-4 to cannibalize for spare parts, but Han and Chewbacca were able to reprogram the war droids, saving CZ-4 and ending the Numm's oppression. The grateful Numm then led Han and Chewie to a freighter wreck, from which the pair were able to salvage parts to repair the Falcon and depart to complete their delivery."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
