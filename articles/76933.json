Knights worked within a House's heirarchy and owned property but were commonly poor enough that they had to send their children out to earn their own fortune. There were two types of Knights; high-born and petty. A high-born knight's title was hereditary, and could be passed to their descendents. High-born knights could also be elevated to the rank of Baron, either by doing a great service too their House, or earning enough money to buy a sponsorship from a member of the privy council. Petty knights were commoners raised to the nobility. As a result, they could hold House assets and marry higher-born nobles but their title was not hereditary."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
