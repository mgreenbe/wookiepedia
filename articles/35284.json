It depicted the Imperial prison on Dathomir shadowed by an ominous storm.

The painting was named simply \"Rare painting\" in the game, and players could use it in their personal house as decoration. Originally, it only appeared as a decoration in Visalis' office, but due to a bug in the early days of the game, players were able to pick up otherwise unobtainable items from various buildings and areas; Dathomir Prison was one of the items that could be picked up. The bug was later resolved, but players were allowed to keep the paintings if they already possessed them. After this, the painting was an extremely rare reward for supporting Visalis in his run for mayor of Bestine. The painting was later added to the game's \"rare loot system,\" which allowed exceedingly rare items to appear on the corpses of any enemy, as a comparatively easier way for players to obtain it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
