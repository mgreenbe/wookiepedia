He began his comics career in the mid 1970s creating underground comics in Canada, including a collaboration with celebrated independent creator Dave Sim. In the late 1970s he was inking regularly for Marvel Comics including their Star Wars series where he alternated inking duties with Bob Wiacek. He left the series soon after the adaptation of The Empire Strikes Back, but returned to pencil two issues in the early 1980s and helped create the Mandalorian characters Fenn Shysa and Tobbi Dala. However, within months of those last two issues seeing print, Day died of a heart attack in his sleep."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Star Wars bibliography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Penciller"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Inker"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover artist"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
