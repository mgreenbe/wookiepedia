For health purposes, it was the only part of the city's infrastructure completely managed by droids, and as such was normally completely flooded with water. Emergency releases allowed each cloaca in the system to be drained, but such an operation could only be done sequentially beginning from the sewage treatment plant on the outside of the city. Entrances to the sewer system were sealed with well-balanced stone lids. Before the battle to retake the planet from Trade Federation occupation, Captain Quarsh Panaka of the Royal Naboo Security Forces used the sewer system to gain entry to Camp Four inside of Theed, allowing various security personnel from the camp to escape, including Mariek Panaka, Tonra, and Naboo Royal Handmaidens Sach\u00e9 and Yan\u00e9."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
