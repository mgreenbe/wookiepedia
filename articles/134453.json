The game incorporated the use of constructable starship miniatures\u2014punched out of styrene cards\u2014as well as card decks and dice. The game was officially released on June 19, 2007. Miniatures included ship and vehicle classes from all films and some Expanded Universe sources, representing Rebel, Imperial, Republic, and Separatist forces. The game was produced by WizKids, Inc. until November 10, 2008, when Topps terminated the game company's operations and discontinued its brand lines, including Star Wars PocketModel TCG."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In July of 2009, National Entertainment Collectors Association, Inc.

The rights that NECA bought from Topps to produce PocketModel brand games, however, did not include the rights to the Star Wars franchise. Therefore, WizKids/NECA has no current plans to produce further Star Wars-themed games."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Rules"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The game was played in turns between 2-8 players. Each player would use a deck of cards\u2014for combat and as objectives\u2014to supplement a fleet of miniatures, called units. Each unit had a value represented by build stars. The number of build stars a unit had told what the unit cost to add to a player's fleet, with smaller units represented by a 1 to 3 build star cost, and larger units, such as capital ships, represented by a 4 to 5 build star cost. Build stars were also often referred to by combat cards, objective cards, and in the rules of the game. Each unit also had four values\u2014Attack, Damage, Defense, and Shields. Units that a player controlled in the game were called friendly units. Units that the opponent controlled in the game were called opposing units."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A game was played with at least thirty build stars of units\u2014with twenty stars of units active at the beginning of the game, and the rest held in reserves\u2014along with a deck of at least thirty cards. Game play began with each player shuffling their decks and placing them face down on their respective sides of the table, in an area designated as the Home Zone. Each player then blindly drew three cards from the top of their own decks and placed them face down next to their decks, representing the Objectives targeted by any opposing players. Then, after deciding who would go first, players selected units with an aggregate number of twenty build stars\u2014amounting to anywhere from four to twenty miniatures\u2014and placed them in front of the three face down Objective cards. Drawing three more cards to their hands, each player would alternate\u2014beginning with the designated first player\u2014making a choice between either one of three actions or passing to the next player. Cards used during play were placed in a Used pile to be shuffled after all cards in the player's starting deck were drawn. This \"recycling\" of cards prevented stagnation in the game, and allowed a greater frequency of opportunity to draw and play certain cards the player placed in the deck as part of their strategy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Players would move units into position to \"strike\" Objective cards in opposing Home Zones, while defending their own Home Zone's Objective cards against opposing units. Objectives losing a strike were considered destroyed and placed into the card owner's used piles. In order for units to \"battle\" each other, both players rolled dice\u2014adding red color-coded Attack bonus attributes, when applicable\u2014to try to beat or tie the total blue-marked Defense value of the opposing unit. If a unit was hit, damage was calculated by adding the yellow-indicated Damage strength of the friendly unit to any applicable bonuses and comparing the total to the opposing unit's green-colored Shield rating. Allocation of damage was depicted by placing styrene damage tabs, called counters, on affected units after a battle. Existing cumulative damage\u2014represented by subtracting the printed Shield value by any attached damage counters\u2014was further decreased by the total damage calculated from the battle action. If damage sustained on a unit was greater than that unit's cumulative Shield-minus-Damage value, the opposing unit was considered \"destroyed\" and placed out of play in the unit owner's reserves. A game was considered over when either all units of one player were left in play, or all but one player's Objectives were destroyed."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cards"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There were two categories of cards in this game: Combat cards and Objective cards. Combat cards could be played only during a \"combat action\", and they had special effects on the game during battles between space or ground units. Objective cards mainly could be used only in the home zone of the player that the card belongs to. They represented essential resources that opponents sought to destroy, and also had special immediate or lasting effects on the game. With the release of the Scum & Villainy expansion, new objectives, called Forward Objectives had a special ability allowing one card of that type per player to be played into the contested zone, potentially for a total of up to eight objectives active in the contested zone depending on the number of players in the game. Before the game was discontinued by Topps and the WizKids company sold to NECA, the Clone Wars Conquest expansion of the game was in final production stages.

These foil printings initially were exclusive to combat cards bearing images of prominent characters from the Star Wars Universe. With the release of the second expansion of the game Order 66, however, foil printed objective cards were introduced. Reprints of other rare cards in foil with alternate images were issued for the purpose of being used as tournament prizes. Two versions of the \"alternate art\" foil cards were printed for prize support. The word \"WINNER\" appeared in silver letters on the bottom-right side of the card designated for the tournament champion.
