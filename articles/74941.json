They were contracted to work for Moff Kentor Sarne on Kal'Shebbol, and, among other projects, designed many of the programming trapdoors that infested the systems of the CR90 corvette FarStar. They were considered the best slicers in the Kathol sector. The Brothers never returned to Pembric II, and had been killed by Sarne's forces after completing their work."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
