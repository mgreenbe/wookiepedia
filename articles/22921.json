Bayrd was appointed as Director of Operations for Trigdale Metallurgy's operations on Goroth Prime."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Director Bayrd believed that Trigdale did not have the resources to support the rights it acquired on Goroth. With full responsibility for the company's profits and losses on the planet, Bayrd became frustrated. He knew that if he succeeded, he would be a hero. Failure would lead to him being a pariah. Bayrd received little support from his headquarters, leading him to break corporate guidelines by negotiating a strategic partnership with the Karflo Corporation in an effort to oust TaggeCo from the number one corporate spot on the planet. Bayrd had no intention of abiding by the alliance in the long-term, looking at the short term gains Trigdale would receive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
