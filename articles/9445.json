It was on station around the fourth planet of the Corvis Minor system. The ship did not bother scanning ships that the commander assumed were part of the fleet and thus allowed the Errant Venture to jump in-system and recover the remains of a fight between Rogue Squadron and Krennel's TIEs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
