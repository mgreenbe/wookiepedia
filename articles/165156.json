In 3 ABY, Serper held the rank of captain and was serving as the senior controller in the command center of Echo Base, the Alliance's secret headquarters on the planet Hoth. Princess Leia Organa was perched next to Serper's station when the smuggler Han Solo informed General Carlist Rieekan, the base's commander, that he had to leave Hoth due to the price on his head.

Rieekan explained the situation to Organa and her companions Han Solo and Chewbacca, with Serper adding that it was made of metal. Organa used this information to rule out the possibility of it being one of the predatory wampa they were dealing with, while Solo suggested it might be one of their own speeders. Serper denied this, then adjusted the controls on his headset and reported that they were getting a weak signal from the unidentified object, turning on an audio speaker so the others could hear it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The protocol droid C-3PO then informed the group that the signal was not one used by the Alliance, suggesting it might be Imperial.

Solo and Chewbacca discovered the blip to be the Imperial Viper probe droid XJ9-CS14, which alerted the Empire to the presence of the rebels before self-destructing.
