She lost her left arm in the wreck and avoided getting prosthetic replacement. She would hang out at starports observing until she found spacers she felt could be trusted. She kept her allegiance to the Alliance quiet, and often would just refer to jobs as \"old merchant friends\" who needed cargo shipped. She couldn't provide many credits for the jobs, but made sure there was decent trade available on the other end of the trip to make it worthwhile."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She had a cheery and upbeat personality, and would do what she could to raise the morale of Rebels that she came in contact with."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She wore a work coverall with straps and pockets that helped deal with the loss of her arm.
