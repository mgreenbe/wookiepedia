Two of the stormtroopers participating in this training exercise are FN-2003 and his friend FN-2187 (\"Finn\"). The narrator describes this as Finn's first step towards an eventful fate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While FN-2003 displays his blaster rifle, FN-2187 waits on the bench and cheers his comrades. A disapproving Captain Phasma tells him to quieten down and reminds FN-2187 that this is a training exercise. A jovial FN-2187 tells FN-2003 that there is a pocket of enemy fighters in the corner. FN-2003 eliminates the cardboard enemy targets before hurling a detonator at a mock-up of Echo Base's deflector shield generator. However, the detonator bounces off the cardboard structure; triggering an explosion that knocks FN-2003 to the ground. Phasma then sends FN-2187 to take part in the exercise and orders him to plant the First Order's flag. A cheerful FN-2187 vows not to let her down, prompting Phasma to reply that \"we shall see.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the training exercise, FN-2187 and FN-2003 formally become stormtroopers and attend a rally organized by Kylo Ren, who tells the troops that today is a glorious day for the First Order. The two troops joke about Kylo Ren's temper until Phasma orders silence in the ranks. Kylo Ren then announces that the stormtroopers are going to attack the people of Jakku, prompting cheers from the ranks. When Finn asks whether the people of Jakku have done something really bad, Phasma responds that they have something that the First Order wants. While FN-2187 is still perplexed, FN-2003 responds that the First Order does not question orders. Phasma then questions FN-2187 whether he has trouble following orders to which the trooper replies no."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kylo Ren then orders the stormtroopers and TIE fighter pilots to move out. FN-2187 is left behind and Captain Phasma harshly reminds him to hurry up. As he leaves, FN-2187 mumbles that the First Order did not cover this issue at the orientation meeting. After boarding an Atmospheric Assault Lander, Phasma tells her subordinates to prepare their gear for an assault in two minutes. While FN-2003 and the other stormtroopers cheer, FN-2187 is still uncomfortable about the mission and asks FN-2003 to explain one more time why this mission is important. FN-2003 tells FN-2187 to shut up and to keep his helmet on or he would get into trouble. However, FN-2187 complaints that he can't see anything with his helmet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the lander descends into Jakku's atmosphere, a reluctant FN-2187 moves to the back of the stormtroopers only to discover that it is actually the frontal ramp. Captain Phasma praises FN-2187 for taking the initiative to lead the assault to Finn's horror. As the ramp opens, FN-2187 still has his helmet hanging loosely over his head and sights Tuanul village in the distance. Phasma then tells him that his destiny lies ahead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
