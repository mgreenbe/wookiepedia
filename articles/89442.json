He accused the Lieutenant of murdering all his comrades, but the Lieutenant revealed that Kardan and Fuse were still alive. Though initially relieved, Tavus still held the Lieutenant accountable for the other deaths. Tavus, like Wraith, expressed pleasure at the opportunity to kill the Lieutenant. They fought, and the Lieutenant came out victorious. Wounded, Tavus expressed regret for his actions, acknowledging that he's responsible for his comrades' deaths for leading them to defect. Lowering his blaster, Tavus offered his services to the Republic, saying he could offer valuable intel. The Lieutenant accepted. At that moment, Republic Special Forces boarded the ship. Once the coast was clear, Garza came aboard. She cordially greeted Tavus, expressing relief that he finally decided to surrender. Tavus bemoaned that he lost everything he was fighting for. Garza reminded that the citizens of the Republic are worth fighting for. She then turned to the Lieutenant and she promoted them to Captain.

Garza told Havoc that their objective was to storm the Bastion, the center of Republic military operations, which Rakton captured during the initial Imperial invasion. But to get there, they needed a landing zone for Phaeris' group of smugglers to deploy their troops. Garza sent Havoc to capture the Imperial-held landing zone where the smugglers' ships were docked.
