It was capable of both atmospheric and deep-space flight (with a maximum atmospheric speed of 500 kilometers per hour).[source?] It had two nearly vertical wings, each packed with miniature concussion missile launchers inside and carrying a heavy rotating double blaster. The pack also included a proton torpedo cannon, mounted over the head of the pack's user."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The pack was allegedly designed several hundred years BBY by General Gustav Zenlav, of the MandalMotors corporation, and originally incorporated an experimental photonic beam where the proton torpedo cannon would eventually be mounted; the addition of the weapon caused Zenlav to shelve the design. Hundreds of years later, the blueprints for the pack fell into the possession of Boba Fett. Recognizing the promise of the design, Fett replaced the photonic beam with the proton torpedo system, and used the Wing-Blast rocket pack to storm Fortress Baarlos, defeat the fortress's Tulvaree guardians, and collect the bounty on Faarl the Conqueror."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Wing-Blast rocket pack first appeared in Hasbro Inc.'s Power of the Force action figure series."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Its history was expanded upon in Abel G.
