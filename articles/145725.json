Another gunship released droids behind them, catching Thorn's squad in a crossfire. Surrounded, but not defeated, the Guard held their ground against the droids in a last effort. After all his men were killed, Thorn yelled out a Republic war cry and kept fighting, using his \"Hammer\" as a melee and ranged weapon.
