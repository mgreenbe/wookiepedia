The Star Destroyer managed to win major victories at Jeyell and Pothor. In the former, it managed to destroy several Nebulon-B escort frigates despite being outnumbered. The ship later defended against the New Republic at the Var-Shaa dockyard and was heavily damaged, but still managed to escape its New Republic pursuers and search for survivors of the battle. Due to the heavy damage it had sustained, the Star Destroyer was forced to be retrofitted before returning to the front lines."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At one point, the Overseer was accompanied by three Arquitens-class command cruisers, four Raider-class corvettes, and two Gozanti-class cruisers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early deployments"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point during the Galactic Civil War, the Overseer participated in battles at Pothor and Jeyell."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Var-Shaa"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Endor, the New Republic Defense Fleet initiated a strike on the Imperial dockyards located in orbit above the planet.

During this time, a number of Star Destroyers had been attacked, which came to the attention of Admiral Rae Sloane.

The mission was interrupted by the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Tormentor in the early stages and Captain Kerrill had to step in with the Overseer to deploy shuttles with boarding parties to extract the intelligence from transports that Titan Squadron had disabled.

During the battle, the New Republic revealed their prototype Starhawk-class battleship Starhawk, where it used its powerful tractor beam to grab the Overseer and push it into the large asteroids floating nearby causing damage to the Star Destroyer. However, LT-514 managed to complete a scan of the New Republic convoy's navicomputer, which had the sector and system details for Project Starhawk.

He denied their request and instead, Gralm ordered Kerrill's forces to help defend the depot from rebel guerrillas. Not happy with this, Kerrill ordered Titan Squadron to patrol the depot and scan for munitions that could be seized. They found baradium in a pair of Zeta-class Heavy Cargo Shuttles. During an attack by the New Republic, the baradium shuttles were remotely-piloted back to the Overseer while Gralm was distracted.

When the Overseer launched a final volley of missiles, it was blocked by the Temperance at the last second, crippling its  hyperdrive.

Disused Star Destroyer cores floating in the debris field were used as traps and targeted as waves of corvettes and a Nebulon-B frigate passed through and were destroyed.

Admiral Sloane sent reinforcements from her fleet to aid Kerrill's mission to finish off the rebels. The Overseer participated in an attack with Titan Squadron on the the damaged Starhawk, defended by Anvil Squadron. Titan Squadron were able to break through and damage the Starhawk's tractor beam core, leading to its certain demise. Imperial defector Lindon Javes arrived to fight but was defeated by one of Titan's pilots. Kerrill, now content with the success of her mission, ordered all Imperial ships to withdraw. While, the rest of Imperial forces remained to mop up the New Republic forces, Titan Squadron went back to the Overseer and they jumped to hyperspace. All other Imperial forces were destroyed when Syndulla sacrificed the Starhawk by crashing it into the moon's exposed core, and the subsequent explosion and shockwave wiped out all their ships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
