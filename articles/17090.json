The ceremony was interrupted by three Jedi Knights, who, under orders from Galia's mother, Queen Amanoa, were sent to retrieve her daughter from the clutches of the Beast Riders. Jedi Knights Ulic Qel-Droma, Cay Qel-Droma, and the Twi'lek Tott Doneeta, were surprised to find that Galia was being married to the Beast Lord, seemingly against her will. After a brief confrontation between them and the Beast Riders, it was discovered that the princess was not being forced to marry Oron Kira, but was doing so of her own accord."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
