This module allowed a droid to make random decisions about given situations for a time, allowing itself to learn the best course of action in each situation. Stochastic chip were used by Republic forces by the time of the Battle of Naboo but most of the droids equipped with such chips were later destroyed. During the Galactic Civil War, the only remaining chip was contained by a B2 super battle droid taken on Naboo by the Ultragungan Militia as a spoil of war. Circa 1 ABY, a spacer managed to access to the droid thanks to the help of Boss Nass and destroyed it to recover the stochastic decision chip."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
