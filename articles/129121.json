They were considered useful for pilots that swapped ship frequently. They came in many shapes and sizes; some even looked like a typical cargo container. It was common for pilots to attach holo-stickers from their travels to their chests, and for messages to be scratched onto the exterior."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Most chests were equipped with padded compartments to store fragile possessions, and other precautionary measures included vacuum and pressure seals. While this provided some protection from harsh environments, the chests were not capable of withstanding re-entry burn if ejected in orbit. The chests normally came with a standard lock but these were often replaced with electronic locking devices. A popular model was the Wanderer Space Chest produced by the SoroSuub Corporation. These cost around two hundred credits. An alternative to spacer's chests were the more portable gear bags."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
