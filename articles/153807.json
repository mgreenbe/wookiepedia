Sometime between 3647\u20133642 BBY, after a severe groundquake, a local Hutt began hoarding medpacs in his palace and selling them at a high price, causing the combat medic Archiban Kimble\u2014better known as Doc\u2014to forge a false death mark against the clan. Doc arranged for the clan to learn of the death mark, and the clan, believing that the Hutt had issued the death mark, attacked the Hutt's palace. Doc stole medpacs from the palace during the chaos, though both the members of the clan and the Hutt were killed in the fighting."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mandalorian clan was first mentioned in the conversation \"Anonymous\" with the Jedi Knight companion character Doc in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, which was released by BioWare and LucasArts in 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
