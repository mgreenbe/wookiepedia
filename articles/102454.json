Before the Galactic Civil War, the ship was sent by Senator Bail Organa to reinforce Commander Jun Sato's unit of the rebellion along with two other Hammerheads, the Amity's Arrow and the Duchess Senna. The three ships were stolen by one of Sato's sub-units, the Spectres, during a raid on the planet Lothal.
