The rest of the vehicle's 8-meter length consisted of an open-air bed capable of carrying up to 1,000 kilograms of cargo. The CS-1 prioritized power over speed, and its cargo capacity met the needs of most owners, though a few attempted to upgrade the vehicle's repulsorlift unit to carry more, rarely with any success. A few owners were able to install weaponry such as a blaster cannon in the bed in order to protect cargo in less civilized regions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The CS-1 was made exclusively for sale with Loronar Corporation's E-9 Explorer scout vessel. While designing a repulsorlift vehicle to complement the E-9, Loronar, who were inexperienced in this area, partnered with Mobquet Swoops and Speeders, who had an excellent reputation in repulsorlift vehicle design. Engineers from both Loronar and Mobquet jointly designed the CS-1. Loronar sold the CS-1 with the E-9 for an additional 12,000 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
