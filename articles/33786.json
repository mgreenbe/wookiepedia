From a list of side characters in A New Hope, Lavery selected Admiral Conan Antonio Motti and wrote about Motti filing a workplace incident report after he was Force choked by Darth Vader. Lavery said he loves \"fussy bureaucrats\" and sought to capture his own impulses towards self-pitying and petty grievances taken to Imperial proportions by Motti.
