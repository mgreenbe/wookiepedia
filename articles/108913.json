The Q9 droids were also intended to serve more functions than those of an astromech droid, and its skills at data access could be used by most diplomats and scholars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Industrial Automaton considered the Q9 series to be a total failure; the personality matrix programming was faulty in most production models, and only a few hundred were produced and sold. Also based on the R2-series, the Q9s were launched without sufficient testing, according to the statements of critics. One of the most famous droids of the Q9-series was Q9-X2, who over-modified himself with an array of gadgets and gizmos. Kyp Durron also owned one, called Q9-01."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
