Four millennia before the Battle of Yavin, Kashyyyk was discovered by the Czerka Corporation, who enslaved the Wookiee population and renamed the planet G5-623, later to Edean. During the Clone Wars, Kashyyyk was a member of the Galactic Republic, and endured enslavement under the Galactic Empire, the Republic's successor. Later, during the rise of the New Republic, Kashyyyk was liberated with the help of Republic forces led by Han Solo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kashyyyk was a temperate jungle planet orbiting around a single star located in the Mytaranor sector of the Mid Rim. The planet had a complement of three moons, one of which was orange. The planet had no axial tilt and a perfectly circular orbit, causing it to lack seasons. The center of the planet was covered with a tropical ocean belt, which contained a number of islands and large coral reefs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Covered in wroshyr trees, Kashyyyk served as homeworld to the Wookiee species. Native fauna such as Can-cells would influence the design of starships by the Wookiee inhabitants, while great cities such as Kachirho would be built into the planet's trees. The Kashyyykian wilds could be dangerous to many, thanks to dangerous animals such as wyyyschokk spiders and carnivorous plants like the jaw plant and saava."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The crash site of the prison ship Ashmead's Lock was known as the Black Forest. Wookiees believed that the Black Forest was cursed and haunted by bad spirits. By 5 ABY, sections of Kashyyyk's forests had been deforested and several rivers had been drained. The Empire also established undersea mining platforms. Mount Arayakyak was once a rainforest orchard known as the Cultivating Talon, which provided Wookiees with fruits such as shi-shok. By the Imperial Era, it had been defoliated by a poisonous black mold."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two years after the planet's liberation by the New Republic, much of the Black Forest had grown back.

Due to its status as a major navigational point, Kashyyyk was of prime strategic importance to the Galactic Republic, which led the Confederacy of Independent Systems to attack the planet toward the end of the Clone Wars. During the battle for their homeworld, hundreds of the Wookiee's catamarans were deployed. Eventually, the Confederacy's invasion fleet was driven off by Jedi General Master Yoda's taskforce, but a massive force of LM-432 crab droids, droid tanks, and gunships remained and occupied the Wawaatt Archipelago."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the help of Yoda and Jedi Master Luminara Unduli, the Grand Army of the Republic managed to get the upper hand over the Separatists.

Used as slave labor, the Empire would utilize the Wookiees to cut down the planet's native wroshyr trees for lumber and farm food to feed the Imperial Army as well as send them off to labor camps and construction jobs such as building the first Death Star, or for science and bio-weapon experiments. In addition to being occupied and enslaved, Kashyyyk was also stripped of its name and designated Imperial territory G5-623.

In the years leading up to the Battle of Yavin, the Imperial Commodore Thrawn and Lieutenant Commander Eli Vanto discovered that Wookiee slaves from Kashyyyk were being transported for processing and health checks to Lansend Twenty-Six.
