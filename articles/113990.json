Few of the replacements possessed the strategic talents or resources commanded by those killed by Daala, but compensated with base cruelty and repression."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The replacement warlords included Moffs Foga Brill, Jmanuel Tethys, Bliss Shargael, and Grand Moff Cinzero Gann.

After the end of the Black Fleet Crisis in 17 ABY, surviving Imperial forces of Black Sword Command escaped to Emperor Palpatine's throneworld of Byss. Upon learning of the planet's destruction years earlier, some of them defected to the New Republic while others joined the Imperial Remnant and other Imperial forces. Four Victory-class Star Destroyers joined the Imperial Deep Core warlords."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 17 ABY, the Council of Moffs of the Imperial Remnant secretly contacted Admiral Daala to launch a joint campaign against the New Republic. However, the squabbling warlords could not provide a united front even with Daala's leadership, and the New Republic's Fourth Fleet, led by General Garm Bel Iblis, launched a crippling series of assaults on their perimeter. In the Battle of Columus, Bel Iblis defeated Daala, forcing her flagship to escape into hyperspace; it remained unaccounted for. Defeated, the Imperial Remnant was forced to negotiate a declaration of peace with the New Republic two years later. However, the replacement warlords themselves remained and they rejected these accords. They severed allegiance to the official Imperial Remnant and later re-organized themselves as the Second Imperium."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Second Imperium"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 18 ABY, the leader of the Constitutional Protectorate of Prakith Moff Brill was assassinated by Lando Calrissian and his commandos on his fortress world of Prakith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Second Imperium was eventually defeated by the New Republic and the New Jedi Order in 23 ABY.
