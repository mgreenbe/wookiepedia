It was the highest rank besides Galactic Emperor and Darth Vader, who was the Supreme Commander of all Imperial Forces.

He acted as an intermediary for the Emperor; few spoke to His Majesty without first going through the Grand Vizier. He was President of the Imperial Senate, was the senior most ranking member of the Imperial Ruling Council, and was also custodian of the Imperial Seal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The position of Grand Vizier was formed after the establishment of the Empire, and may have been a replacement for two pre-existing offices, those of Vice Chair and Staff Aide. The only individual to serve in the office was Sate Pestage. As head of the Imperial Government, Pestage was not only a very powerful bureaucrat, he was a loyal and trusted servant to Palpatine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In a cut scene from Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, Sate Pestage was intended to have an appearance as a hologram warning Darth Vader of the Emperor's imminent transmission.
