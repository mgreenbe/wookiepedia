It could be used to open doors within the temple, but also to activate a superweapon designed to take life when placed in an obelisk at the top of the building. Maul attempted to steal it with the help of Ezra Bridger to gain access to the superweapon to get revenge on all his enemies, whereas the Sith Lord Darth Vader planned to take both the holocron and the temple's power to maintain the Sith's rule over the galaxy. Both of the Sith Lords' plans, however, were thwarted when Bridger and his Master Kanan Jarrus were able to pull the holocron from the obelisk at the last moment and escape with it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2 BBY, Ezra and the former Sith Lord Maul merged the Sith and Jedi holocrons to learn the secret of destroying the Sith. The process was interrupted by Kanan, creating an explosion that damaged both holocrons.

The holocron could also power a superweapon in the Sith temple on Malachor. The holocron was then use when the Jedi Knights attacked Malachor and was activated. Both the Jedi and Sith forces were destroyed and the holocron was hidden beneath the temple."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Age of the Empire"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Quest on Malachor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the destruction of his Shadow Collective, the former Sith Lord Maul ventured to Malachor in search of the Holocron. However, he was unable to enter the temple by himself. The Eighth Brother of the Inquisitorius also searched for the holocron and Maul."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Three years before the Battle of Yavin,[source?] former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus and his apprentice Ezra Bridger went to Malachor where they learned of the holocron from Maul. After being separated from Ahsoka and Kanan by a cave-in, Ezra befriended Maul and the two joined forces to extract the holocron from a Sith altar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After reuniting with Ahsoka and Kanan and driving away several Inquisitors, Maul convinced the Jedi and Ahsoka to join forces with him to venture into the temple and find secrets that could destroy the Sith. The Eighth Brother later attempted to take the holocron from Ezra but was driven away by Maul. Venturing into the temple, Maul instructed Ezra to take the holocron and plant it in the obelisk at the top of the temple. Ezra complied with Maul's instructions and encountered a female entity called Presence who informed him that the holocron was key to reactivating the temple; which was an ancient Sith superweapon capable of destroying all life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ezra refused to use the weapon and he was later ambushed by the Sith Lord Darth Vader, who had wanted to use the temple's power for the Sith. Before Vader could finish off Ezra, he was confronted by Ahsoka. While the two fought, Ezra was joined by a blinded Kanan, who had been betrayed by Maul but had managed to push the Dark Sider off a cliff. Working together, master and apprentice managed to remove the holocron from the obelisk. Since the temple's power was building up, it triggered an implosion that devastated the temple. Ezra and Kanan managed to escape with Chopper on the Phantom but Ahsoka and Vader were left behind. The former Jedi knight and Padawan survived and parted company."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Passing hands"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the events on Malachor, Ezra blamed himself for Kanan's blinding and Ahsoka's presumed death. He began to turn to the Sith holocron in order to learn how to protect his friends. By that stage, Ezra had risen in the ranks of the Phoenix Cell to become a Lieutenant Commander. Using the holocron, Ezra learned more aggressive lightsaber techniques and Force powers. During a mission to rescue Hondo Ohnaka, Ezra used the Force to take control of an AT-DP driver's mind. Under Ezra's influence, the pilot attacked his fellow stormtroopers before riding his walker off a walkway."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ezra's actions alarmed both Sabine Wren and his master Kanan. Later, Kanan discovered Ezra consulting the Sith holocron in his room and chastised his apprentice. Angered, Ezra stormed out of the room and told Kanan he did not need him nor the holocron. Realizing that his relationship with Ezra was damaged, Kanan meditated outside Chopper Base on the planet Atollon. In the wilderness, he encountered a powerful being called Bendu, who claimed that he stood in the middle between the light side and the dark side. After examining the holocron, he opined that the object could be used for both good and evil and that only a person had the power to change themselves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After learning to overcome his fear of the arachnid krykna, Kanan left the Sith holocron in the Bendu's safe keeping. The Bendu placed the holocron inside an underground cave that was guarded by several krykna. Later, Maul took Ezra and Kanan's friends Hera Syndulla, Garazeb Orrelios, Chopper, and Sabine Wren hostage. He threatened to kill the prisoners unless the Jedi brought the Sith holocron and Kanan's Jedi holocron. Kanan and Ezra traveled back to Atollon to retrieve the Sith holocron from the Bendu."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bendu opined that the holocron was a source of imbalance between Ezra and his master. He warned that merging the two holocrons would provide clarity of vision that could be used for malevolent purposes. Nevertheless, he allowed Ezra to retrieve the holocron from the krykna tunnel. Working with his master, Ezra managed to retrieve the holocron without antagonizing the krykna. The two then rendezvoused with Maul at Vizsla Keep 09 in space. Maul wanted to use Kanan's holocron and the Sith holocron to look into future for hope while Ezra still wanted to find a way to destroy the Sith. Working together, they managed to combine the two holocrons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maul initially saw nothing but oblivion but Ezra saw twin suns. Maul also discovered that his old enemy, Obi-Wan Kenobi, was still alive. Before Ezra could discover the knowledge to destroying the Sith, Kanan arrived and convinced his apprentice to let go. Ezra closed his eyes, causing an explosion, which damaged the two holocrons. Ezra was reunited with his rebel friends who vowed to find the knowledge to destroy the Sith. However, Maul escaped and fled into space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the ritual, both Ezra and Maul saw elements of each other's visions. Following a ritual on Dathomir to merge their minds, Ezra and Maul learned that Kenobi was indeed alive and hiding on a planet with twin suns. Despite the damage to the holocrons, Maul was able to use a fragment of the Sith holocron to activate both Kanan's Jedi holocron and the Sith holocron at Chopper Base in an effort to lure Ezra to Tatooine in order to draw Kenobi out of hiding. This plan worked, but Maul was ultimately defeated and killed by Kenobi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
