In the same game, the cues titled \"Anakin vs. Obi-Wan\" and \"The Boys Continue\" are played while playing as Darth Vader. In LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga, \"Battle of the Heroes\" is a part of the changed music in Episode III levels. A variant of it is also heard in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode \"Ghosts of Mortis\", when The Son shows Anakin a vision of what he'll become. The main theme is also heard in the episode \"Destiny\" when Yoda begins experiencing visions of the fall of the Jedi. Portions of \"Battle of the Heroes\" were also heard as part of the Boss battle BMG for the Nintendo DS version of Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
