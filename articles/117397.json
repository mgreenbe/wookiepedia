The company operated several stores around Galactic City. The storefront showed the company's name in Aurebesh symbols, while the fa\u00e7ade was decorated with a luminous sign that read \"hot\". At least one of the shops featured additional signage, which showed a woman in a dress/coat. Sometimes, the Ross shops would sell their goods at a lower price than usual, whereupon a luminous \"sale\" sign would be put up, in order to attract customers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
