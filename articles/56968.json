Crafting the hilt from a lacquered piece of greel-wood, the lightsaber was powered by a pontite crystal mined from the crystal caves in the Eocho Mountains. The lightsaber was meant to symbolize the Order's principle of defense rather than offense. After Morm's death, the lightsaber was interred within a vault in the Chamber of Antiquities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
