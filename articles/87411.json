She recorded a conversation between an undercover Imperial spy Commander Rylon and the apprentice of Darth Baras that confirmed Rylon's duplicity and threatened to expose Baras' network of spies. Unfortunately for her, the Imperials became aware of her presence and blocked her attempts to reach her ship, forcing her to head to Sobrik Spaceport to find another. She was cornered by the Sith Warrior in Hangar 61 of the Sobrik Spaceport and engaged him in a duel, boasting that Baras already lost, as the incriminating information has been sent off-world. She urged the Warrior to abandon the dark side and find redemption, but the Sith ignored her and attacked. Mashallon defended herself and, despite believing that the Sith Warrior's adherence to the dark side made them weak, her opponent was able to overpower her. Left at the Sith's mercy, she openly welcomed death, believing she had finally struck a blow against the Empire, only for Imperial Lieutenant Malavai Quinn to arrive with a squad of troopers, revealing that he had intercepted her transmission, keeping the Jedi Council in the dark. Despite her failure, Mashallon promised that Karr and his Padawan would defeat Baras and his apprentice, after which the Warrior executed her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mashallon is a non-player character from the massively multi-player online role playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare in 2011.
