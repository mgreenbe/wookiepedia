It had four massive, pillar like legs that connected to its body. The two front legs were considerably thin for its bulky body, and had two joints. The first joint connected the upper arm to the lower arm, both which were made of thick sheets of metal, and allowed vertical movement of the lower arm. The second was a wrist like joint, which allowed the Fire-breather to twist its upper feet in different directions. The upper feet consisted of three large metal fingers, which could also be flexed around."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
