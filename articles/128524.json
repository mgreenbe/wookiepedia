It was part of preparations against a Galactic Alliance attack on Centerpoint Station. They resembled astromech droids, but with a sonic generator instead of a head. They could bring down Jedi alive with a sonic attack. Nearby Corellians used sound cancellers to prevent collateral damage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
