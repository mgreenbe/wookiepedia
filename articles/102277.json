He worked on Taris as part of the restoration effort and performed deep-core drilling operation to obtain the samples from the planet's core; though the samples were in fact contraband Taris relics. He was supposed to provide the samples to Beryl Thorne as part of the contract, but his camp was ambushed by scavengers who stole valuable equipment as well as the samples. After Beryl's contact Voidhound arrived to collect the samples, Ovold had to direct the smuggler to the location the samples were taken instead. While on Taris, Ovold wore X-1 combat goggles at all time, keeping visual scanning for rakghouls and other dangerous wildlife."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
