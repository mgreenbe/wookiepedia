The proposal was vigorously denounced by Slotho, who claimed the Republic was playing upon their fears of a Separatist attack to take control of their world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the negotiations could go any further however, the conference was disrupted by the intervention of a Separatist GNK power droid, which powered down the automated diplomatic complex and instructed its droid servants to kill the diplomats. The occupants of the building were then attacked by a cleaning droid, a garbage droid, R5-series astromech droids, mouse droids, and holograms of B1-Series battle droids and droidekas. The diplomats were saved by R2-D2, which shut down the Separatist power droid and rebooted the automated facility."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
