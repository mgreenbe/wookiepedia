Kester's activities did not go unnoticed, as Squad 40, an Imperial commando squad from the 501st Legion, was tasked to capture him. When Squad 40 stormed Kester's hideout, they were surprised when they came face to face with Jedi Master Iri Camas instead. Camas distracted the commandos long enough to allow Kester to escape. In the end, Camas sacrificed himself by igniting a gas pipe and destroying the hideout in the subsequent explosion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
