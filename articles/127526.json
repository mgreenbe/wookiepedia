Yoda tells Luke to stop him at all costs, lest he reveal their location and doom the Rebellion. Luke manages to capture Milko, but instead of killing him, lets him go free with the knowledge that if he revealed the location of Yoda, he'd also have to reveal that he groveled before a Jedi instead of capturing him. Luke is left wondering if this was just another of Yoda's tests, and if he passed or failed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Canonization"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The events of the story are mentioned in Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide."}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
