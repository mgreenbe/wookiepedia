Some models of escape pod had a handheld transponder, so that occupants of the pod could take it with them if they had to leave the immediate vicinity of the pod. Transponders in Imperial escape pods were designed so the signal could only be picked up by Imperial searchers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
