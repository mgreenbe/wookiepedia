The city was designed by The Architects of Vaale, who created numerous other artifacts including the Rings of Vaale, which supposedly provided their wearer with great power. The living bone matter contained a security system set in place by the Architects which emitted frequencies that targeted brain waves. The security system went rogue, driving the population of Vaale mad and causing the collapse of Dianth's society."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rogue archaeologist Doctor Chelli Aphra visited the city alongside a crew after the Shadow University student Detta Yao hired her to find the Rings of Vaale, but were pursued by mercenaries working for the Tagge family scion Ronen Tagge, who also wished to acquire the artifacts.
