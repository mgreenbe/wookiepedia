The droid taxi driver spoke in binary and was round in shape, piloting a squarish taxi. A map of the summer capital was stored in R2X7's memory banks, and the combined operations of calculating a suitable route for customers and translating from other languages such as Galactic Basic Standard put stress on the droid's memory capacities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Jedi Master Mostema and her Padawan Sean arrived at the summer capital's spaceport, the two hired the air taxi of R2X7. Sean used a communications wristband to speak to the driver in binary, prompting the lights on the droid's head to flicker and flash in a welcome surprise, as having an organic customer who could under stand binary was rare in the competitive taxi business. R2X7 quickly found a suitable destination for Sean, and recommended a bar situated by the Gold Scale to Sean as the latter sat down on the co-pilot seat. After half an hour's drive, the Jedi were delivered to their destination, and was offered a discount by R2X7, who accepted payment in the form of the local currency."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
