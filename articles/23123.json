The blaster cannon included a portable, shoulder-fired version that was small enough to be carried and fired by a single person. Because of their design, battle droids could be built with powerful cannons that were integrated into their systems. Examples of these included the DSD1 dwarf spider droid, the LM-432 crab droid, and the droideka."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Other cannons were too large to be carried and needed to be mounted on a tripod or fired from a stationary position. The largest of these were used as ground emplacements or artillery. Examples of these included the air defense tower, the Gormak cannon, the Harnaidan defensive cannon, and the LR1K sonic cannon. Despite its size, the AV-7 Antivehicle Cannon was actually able to move due to its built-in repulsorlifts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Powerful cannons were also mounted on vehicles and starships, such as ion cannons and laser cannons. One of the largest ion cannons ever constructed was the ion pulse cannon, which was used by the starship Malevolence. An immensely large laser cannon was the turbolaser, which was generally installed in banks on capital ships and space stations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
