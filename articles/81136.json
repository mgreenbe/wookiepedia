Later on, he took part in a second raid on the refueling station. During the attack, he was stealing a small crate when Tamara Ryvora rammed a repulsor carrier into him, sending him crashing into the wall. Ryvora left him sprawled across the floor as residents of the Colossus came to seize the contents of the carrier. Later, after the Warbirds had allied with the Colossus, Leoz placed a curse on Kazuda Xiono after being angered by the pilot's winning streak on a gambling game Xiono had been invited to play because the pirates thought he'd be easy pickings. Xiono later got back at Leoz by giving him a talisman he'd gotten from Mika Grey, which he claimed was itself cursed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leoz had orange skin, one blue eye, the other being covered with an eye patch.
