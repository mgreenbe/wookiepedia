Droid-maker Lema Xandret launched eight missiles filled with hex droids from Sebaddon as an answer. Only one missile survived intact and penetrated Corellia's hull. Gurin, unaware of hexes droids threat, quickly assured the participants of the mission that the cruiser had remained intact.

He was replaced by captain Pipalidi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
