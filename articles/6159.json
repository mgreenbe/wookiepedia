Eventually attaining the rank of Jedi Knight after passing his Trials of Knighthood, Cros began independent study on the path of the Jedi Consular; particularly the way of the diplomat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 47 BBY, the native species of the planet Nyriaan staged an uprising against offworld settlers; the latter of which made a plea to the Jedi Order for assistance. In response, the Jedi High Council dispatched Cros to hammer out a truce between the two groups, hoping to bring a swift end to the conflict. Despite Cros' diplomatic abilities, he was unable to end the conflict until 43 BBY. During the time Cros spent amongst the Nyriaanans, he became enamored with their culture and spirit, and refused to report back to the Council or Coruscant after the truce went into effect. Instead, Cros was appointed as Jedi Watchman for the planet, as the Council believed it would be useful to have an envoy on the planet in the event that another conflict erupted there in the future."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seven years later, the natives rose up again, and this time Cros was at the forefront of their rebellion. The High Council declared that he had gone rogue, but refrained from sending any other Jedi to stop him. The conflict eventually ended in 30 BBY when the Luire Accord resulted in the creation of a new planetary government\u2014the Nyriaan Concord. Cros became the leader of the native delegation to the Concord, but he found the political body to be corrupt and ill-prepared. He soon left in disgust and traveled to the unexplored regions of Nyriaan, accompanied by a large number of native followers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite adopting the culture of the native Nyriaanans, Cros carried on a belief in Jedi philosophy.
