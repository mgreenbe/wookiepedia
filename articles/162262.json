Some manuals referred to it as the RS 557. The Vulptereen pilot Dud Bolt owned a Vulptereen 327, and used it during the Boonta Eve Classic of 32 BBY. During the third lap, Bolt intentionally slammed his pod into the Podracer of competitor Ark Roose. Although Roose crashed, Bolt crashed his own pod as well. Bolt later returned to racing with a Vulptereen 327. Another pilot used a Vulptereen 327 during the Vinta Harvest Classic race on the planet Malastare."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
