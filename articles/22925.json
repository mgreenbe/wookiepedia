She spent time on Ord Mynock looking for jobs so she could pay off a loan shark that lent her credits to repair her YT-1000 freighter. It was damaged when Cambra helped some Rebel agents escape an Imperial prison and she had to dump her load of illegal spice in the resulting confusion. While on Ord Mynock, she was hunted down by a bounty hunter who was to collect the 15,000 credits she still owed. During her search for jobs, she was approached by a mysterious man who suggested that it would be worth her while to keep an eye on Ellos Ripfire because he was going to need help soon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
