A modest building constructed of white stone with horizontal black markings, the Tower was the meeting place of the Law Elders of Bimmisaari, the planet's main governing body. Within the tower the walls were covered by large tapestries, and the top level was home to a small museum which held relics from the middle era of the Old Republic. A New Republic delegation led by Leia Organa Solo met at the Tower of Law in 9 ABY to discuss the planet's admittance into the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
