Although Xiono, who had only recently discovered San's true allegiance, knew she had been working for the pirates, he also figured that she was a good person, having helped him during the Bibo incident and the kidnapping of Torra Doza, as well as considering her a friend."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Therefore, he along with astromech droid BB-8 and his friend Neeku Vozo, helped San escape in the last of the platform's escape pods.

Unknown to many on the Colossus, the First Order had been using them as proxies. Due to the First Order's efforts in rescue his daughter, Captain Doza allowed the First Order to establish a presence on the Colossus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a result, First Order stormtroopers began patrolling the platform's streets and verifying the identity of its residents.

After stormtroopers visited Jarek Yeager's Repair Station seeking information on Synara, the undercover Resistance spy Kazuda Xiono realized that his friend was in danger. Meanwhile, Synara contacted her boss Kragan and sought his help in getting off the Colossus. However, Kragan was unable to assist due to the tight First Order security cordon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Xiono's BB-series astromech droid companion and minder BB-8 argued against helping Synara due to her role in Torra's kidnapping, Kaz countered that he liked her as a friend because she had helped to rescue Torra and protect the Colossus during the Bibo incident. Later that night, Kaz visited Synara at the loading dock with BB-8 and offered to help escape the Colossus.
