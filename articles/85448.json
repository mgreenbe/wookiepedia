About the size of skettos, and with somewhat reptilian heads, mailocs were constantly airborne, lacking legs, and also possessed very large, two-pronged stingers\u2014that could penetrate most armor and personal shields\u2014at the ends of their tails. Mailocs often appeared in swarms and attacked by swooping down on their prey, biting with their small jaws and stinging with their tails. They emitted a high-pitched shriek when excited."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
