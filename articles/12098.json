Their forward compartment could be opened in transit and used to salvage items found drifting in space, even entire starships. Built in orbital shipyards, ships of the class were designed to never enter a planet's atmosphere, instead they were docked at space stations and transfer yards to load and unload cargo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One such freighter was the Eravana, Han Solo and Chewbacca's ship after the loss of the Millennium Falcon.
