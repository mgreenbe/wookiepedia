Taking its name from the Mando'a word for \"gauntlet\", Death Watch's leader by 21 BBY, Pre Vizsla, owned a Kom'rk-class fighter during the Clone Wars, which he named Gauntlet, and made use of as his personal transport. Over fifty meters in length, and equipped with laser cannons and powerful engines, each Kom'rk model was an able assault craft and fighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several Kom'rk fighters were stationed at the Death Watch's hideout on Mandalore's moon, Concordia. During a confrontation with Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi in the second year of the Clone Wars, Vizsla ordered his Death Watch soldiers to evacuate the area aboard their Kom'rk-class fighters. However, the Death Watch returned to their base shortly after, bringing their Kom'rk fighters with them, waiting in preparation for a Separatist-backed conquest of Mandalore that was delayed due to the efforts of the New Mandalorian leader, Duchess Satine Kryze. Later, after having been driven from the Mandalore system, Death Watch relocated to the frigid world of Carlac with their Kom'rk fighters, where the transports ringed their camp."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 20 BBY, a squadron of the Death Watch's Kom'rk-class transports came across an escape pod over Florrum containing the Sith Lord Darth Maul and his apprentice, Savage Opress. The fighter docked with the pod, and its crew recovered the injured Sith, returning with them to the Death Watch's encampment on Zanbar. There, an alliance was formed between Death Watch and the Sith, and they set out to collect further allies among Black Sun and the Hutt kajidics, storming the Black Sun base on Mustafar and the hall of the Hutt Grand Council on Nal Hutta with troops launched from their Kom'rk fighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Dimensions"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kom'rk-class fighter/transport came in at least two models.

By the start of the Clone Wars, a galaxy-spanning conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, numerous Kom'rk-class fighters had entered into the possession of the Death Watch.

These Kom'rk fighters were used to evacuate the base of its troops when Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi discovered the Death Watch, on the orders of the sect's leader, Pre Vizsla. While his soldiers boarded their vessels, and the Kom'rk transports lifted off and away from the mines, Vizsla engaged Kenobi in single combat, managing to overcome the Jedi with the aid of a trio of his men. However, once the Jedi had fled, Vizsla and his Death Watch army soon returned, and brought their Kom'rk fighters with them. There, the vessels and their owners waited for the order to begin an attack Vizsla promised would allow the Death Watch to take control of Mandalore and destroy the dominance of the pacifistic New Mandalorian government. That order never came, due to the efforts of the New Mandalorians' leader, Satine Kryze, who was able to halt the Republic military occupation that the Death Watch would need to justify their actions in the eyes of the Mandalorian people."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kom'rk-class fighter/transport first appeared in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series' second season episode, The Mandalore Plot, originally aired on January 29, 2010.

The ship's name was never featured in either episode, but revealed through the reference book, Star Wars: The Clone Wars Official Episode Guide Series 1 & 2.
