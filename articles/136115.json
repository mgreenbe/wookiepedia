The hunter gave the droid a second brain and installed illegal decryption software. After the hunter's death when their starship crashed in Tatooine's Western Dune Sea, the wreckage was eventually discovered by a tribe of Jawas. One of them, Jot, discovered the droid. Its main body was irreparably damaged, but the second brain was still intact, so Jot took it for himself. After discovering the droid's still-functional holoprojector, and using it to watch footage of the long-deceased bounty hunter's last flight, Jot dubbed the droid \"Storyteller\". The droid stayed in Jot's secret hiding place aboard his tribe's sandcrawler, and Jot would take it the memory cores of other droids the Jawas picked up, to play what was recorded on them before he wiped the data. In 0 BBY, Jot took Storyteller the memory core of an unusual R2 series astromech droid that had recently been discovered wandering in the Jundland Wastes. This droid's memory core was unusually difficult for Storyteller to decrypt, and the long, epic story it told astonished Jot, to the point that he replaced the core without wiping it, as was his usual practice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
