Another duel occurred in orbit between Dooku, Opress and the Nightsister Asajj Ventress, and later, another duel between Opress, Kenobi and Skywalker. In addition, Ventress and Dooku also had another brief skirmish."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Opress, under orders from his new master, went to Toydaria in order to kidnap King Katuunko alive. Unfortunately for the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the mission was in shambles when Opress killed Katuunko in a rage and presented the body to Dooku, enraging the Dark Lord who punished him as a result. The confrontation continued over Toydaria aboard Dooku's Separatist dreadnaught, where Dooku's former apprentice, Asajj Ventress, attempted to exact revenge on her old Master with the help of Opress, who was under her control. However, Opress turned on both Dooku and Ventress, and while Ventress pursued Dooku, Opress dueled with Kenobi and Skywalker, who had arrived to eliminate him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The showdown ended when both Ventress and Opress escaped their pursuers alive, while the Jedi also fled from the cruiser."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "On the surface"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Savage Opress arrived, a trio of Toydarian guards was patrolling the landing platform. The moment Opress exited his ship, he ignited his lightsaber and quickly dispatched the first two guards before using the Force to strangle the third, throwing him against the palace entrance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The king was informed of the attack and ordered his palace guards to stop the assailant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bursting down the door to the throne room, Opress entered the palace and killed all the guards present. Taking an elevator platform, the Zabrak raised himself face to face with the King"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite being alone with the Dark Acolyte, Katuunko stood firm and refused to be intimidated by the brutal show of force, drawing his sword and preparing to fight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi and Skywalker, both tasked with tracking down Savage, arrived on Dathomir to seek an audience with Mother Talzin, who gave them a tip to Savage's whereabouts. They arrived on Toydaria and touched down on the landing platform."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back inside the throne room, the Toydarian king managed to elude his adversary's first few strikes, but Opress quickly slashed the King's sword in two. Katuunko, making a bid for escape, attempted to fly over his attacker. However, Savage managed to grab hold of his quarry's leg and slam him into a wall, knocking him unconscious. With his prisoner over his shoulder, the Sith turned to leave, only to be confronted by Kenobi and Skywalker, who had entered the palace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two Jedi sprinted onto two elevators that flanked the kidnapper and were lifted up high about the palace floor.\nJumping onto Kenobi's platform, Opress made a few quick strikes. Kenobi evaded the attack and leapt backwards onto an adjacent elevator as Skywalker used the Force to ram an unoccupied lift into Opress's foothold. The impact, however, succeeded in rousing Katuunko and enabled him to struggle free of Opress's grip. Distracted by his prize, Opress turned to recapture him. This momentary lapse allowed Kenobi and Skywalker to leap down and tackle Savage, deactivating his lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Katuunko flew towards the exit, Opress held out his hand, and began to Force choke the king.\nDespite the Jedis' best efforts to stop him, the Dark Acolyte was able to strike them both in the face before crushing Katuunko's neck, killing him instantly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Summoning his strength, Opress shot to his feet, throwing Kenobi and Skywalker high into the air. At the last moment, Skywalker grabbed the edge of one of the lifts with his former Master dangling from his feet, high above the floor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Opress seized the opportunity and jumped on the same platform, stomping on Skywalker's fingers and forcing the two Jedi to plummet to the ground. Savage then attempted to finish the pair off by stabbing the platform and bringing it crashing down onto the men below. At the last possible moment, Kenobi and Skywalker used the Force to slow the elevator enough to soften its impact. Quickly leaving his foes behind, Opress took hold of Katuunko's lifeless body and dragged him out to his waiting ship. After throwing the corpse into his ship, Opress used the Force to push the shuttle, that had carried the Jedi, over the edge of the landing platform. Opress then boarded his starship and escaped with the King's body."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Inside the palace, Kenobi and Skywalker pushed the collapsed lift off of them and ran, lightsabers at the ready, to the platform. Once there, however, they found their ship destroyed and the Sith gone. But, not yet giving up, Kenobi spotted Katuunko's personal star yacht, Thief's Eye, which the pair commandeered."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle in space"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Above the planet, a Providence-class carrier/destroyer awaited Savage Opress's arrival. The Zabrak landed his ship in the carrier's hangar bay and brought the body of Katuunko to Count Dooku. Angered by his apprentice's incompetence, the Sith Lord struck Savage with a bolt of Force lightning. Savage, doubled over in pain, begged his master for forgiveness, to which Dooku replied that forgiveness was not the way of the Dark Side. Shocking the weakened Savage again, the door to the ship's bridge opened and Asajj Ventress stood in the doorway."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shocked by the return of the apprentice he thought dead, Dooku ignited his lightsaber and told Savage that he could redeem himself for his failure by killing the witch. Ventress, however, was unimpressed by this and calmly walked up to Savage, placing her finger on his forehead and reawakening his loyalty to her. Both assailants then turned and activated their own lightsabers, preparing to duel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the confrontation on the bridge, the Toydarian ship piloted by Kenobi and Skywalker streaked towards the Separatist dreadnought. Kenobi speculated that this had been a plot by Dooku to exact revenge on Katuunko for his refusal to join the Confederacy. The pair landed the ship in the hangar and quickly ran to find Savage, dispatching three B1-Series battle droids in the process."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back on the bridge, Ventress made the first move, lashing out ferociously at her former master. Dooku easily blocked her strikes and kicked her aside. It was then that Savage lunged into the battle. Recovering herself, Ventress stood and attacked with Savage simultaneously, but Dooku was still able to block or avoid every blow before kicking Ventress to the ground again. Attacking alone and with much force, Savage swung wildly at the Sith Lord. Dooku, a master of lightsaber dueling, simply evaded every swing without even parrying. But, on the last downward chop, the Count was forced to block and the strength behind the blow sent him flying across the room, knocking the lightsaber from his hand."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ventress, who had gotten back to her feet, ordered Opress to kill Dooku. However, as Opress raised his blade to strike down the man, Dooku unleashed a blast of Force lightning and threw the Nightbrother across the room. The Sith Lord then attempted to recover his lightsaber with a Force Pull, but his former apprentice managed to pull it as well, sending it flying to another part of the bridge. Without his lightsaber, all Dooku could do was dodge and evade as Ventress hacked and slashed at him with her blades. Opress once again tried to strike down the Sith but was quickly sidestepped and shocked with lightning a second time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As he continued to electrocute the Zabrak, Ventress swung her blades at Dooku, who ducked away and pulled his lightsaber back into his hand. The two continued to duel as Opress recovered. Standing up, the Nightbrother attempted to lunge at Dooku, only to be greeted by another blast of Force lightning. Ventress, disgusted at his weakness, repeatedly ordered him to kill Dooku, but each time he made an attack, he was electrocuted. When Opress admitted that Dooku was too strong, Ventress became even more enraged, saying that his lack of ability would not be her undoing. Dooku responded that a failed apprentice made for an awful teacher."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Opress, torn between his loyalty to Ventress and his inability to defeat Dooku, roared in fury and used the Force to choke both of them, lifting them off the ground. Dooku and Ventress both struggled helplessly as Opress threw them both across the room, slamming them into the wall. As the pair got to their feet, Opress lunged in and began to attack them both, striking at them and again throwing them about."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Momentarily ceasing their duel, Dooku and Ventress retaliated with a blast of lightning and a powerful push. The truce did not last long, however, as the Count attempted to electrocute Ventress, who absorbed the bolts into her lightsaber. Seeing his chance to escape, Dooku opened a hatch in the floor and leapt down it, followed by Ventress who sealed it behind her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Just as Opress was about to cut through the hatch, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker ran into the bridge. Planning on attacking together, the Jedi started to approach the Dark Acolyte. Opress turned towards the both of them, charged, and with a load roar, Force pushed them hard out into the hallway. The two Jedi hit the wall and dropped their lightsabers, deactivating them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the corridors below the bridge, the duel between Dooku and Ventress continued. After a few moments of strikes and parries, Dooku managed to jerk Ventress's lightsabers from her hands with the Force, before subjecting her to a blast of electricity. Standing over his wounded foe, Dooku raised his blade and stabbed downward; trying to finish the job he had failed to do once before. But, just as the blade was about to pierce her, Ventress Force pushed the blade, causing it to miss her by inches and, instead, stab into a steam line. The steam burst forth from the pipe and into the Count's face, blinding him for a moment. Ventress seized the opportunity and recovered her lightsabers before diving into an escape pod and jettisoning to safety."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unable to pursue the woman who had escaped him for a second time, Dooku ordered the battle droids on the ship to destroy Opress, as he was now a traitor. Moments after the order was received, Opress and the pair of Jedi, still locked in battle, entered the hangar. The droids immediately began to fire on both sides of the fight, but Skywalker noted that they seemed to be concentrating on Opress. B1 and B2 battle droids, as well as a few Droidekas, encircled the Zabrak and fired on him, scoring numerous hits. In an attempt to escape, Opress let loose a Force Shockwave, knocking back the droids and Jedi. Opress managed to limp back to his ship and take off, leaving behind the Kenobi and Skywalker, who soon escaped as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the battle, Savage Opress returned to Dathomir, where he spoke with Mother Talzin. Feeling that he was betrayed by Ventress and knowing the Jedi were after him, he lamented over his weakness. Mother Talzin, however, reassured him that he would become stronger. At first, Opress did not believe her, pointing out that he no longer had anyone to teach him. Mother Talzin then told him of his long lost brother, Darth Maul, who was living in exile in the Outer Rim. When Opress asked how to find his brother, Mother Talzin gave him a talisman that would act as a compass to lead him to his brother."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
