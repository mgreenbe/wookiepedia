He appeared again in Jedi Knight's expansion pack, Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith. Mysteries of the Sith introduced \"multiplayer personalities\", a form of character creation that put different character models under different professions. Each profession also had their own set of starting weapons for a match. One-Eye was categorized as a bounty hunter. It is not known if One-Eye is meant to be the character's name or a nickname.
