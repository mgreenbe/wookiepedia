It was written by John Williams and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra in 1983. The motif is played as Yoda confirms that Darth Vader was indeed the father of Luke Skywalker, during the track \"Yoda's Revelations.\" The motif is also played throughout \"Luke and Leia\" as a bridge between segments of its main melody."}]}
