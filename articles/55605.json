The planet of Corellia was invaded by the Sith Empire in that year as part of the Galactic War between the Empire and the Galactic Republic, and Sevintran was part of the first group of Jedi who were sent to aid the Corellians and the Republic Military in the Battle of Corellia. During the lengthy fighting against the Imperial Military and the Sith, many Jedi were killed, and Sevintran was among the few Jedi still on Corellia's surface when Grand Master Satele Shan dispatched Jedi reinforcements from the Outer Rim Territories."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Force-sensitive Advozse male with black eyes, orange-brown skin, and a dark brown horn common to his species, Sevintran was proud to be a member of the Jedi Order and believed that unity would allow the Republic and the Jedi to win the fight for Corellia.

Sevintran will only appear in the Jedi Knight mission \"Jedi Commander\" on Corellia if the player fails to redeem the Sith Lord Praven on Tatooine during Act I, and Sevintran will then appear in Praven's place in the tunnel system in the Blastfield Shipyards district. He will continue to appear in Praven's place in all subsequent cutscenes, though neither Sevintran nor Praven speak to the player after their initial meeting. As a Republic character, the Jedi Knight is assumed to only choose the moral light side options, so this article assumes that the player successfully convinced Praven to become a Jedi and therefore never encountered Sevintran. While his ultimate fate is left unknown in the light-side scenario, Sevintran's comments about his time on Corellia before the Hero's arrival are still taken to be correct."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
