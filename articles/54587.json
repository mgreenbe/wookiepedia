In the year 3956 BBY, he sent a package of 50 credits and a suit of Echani fiber armor to Uksaris at the Lower City Apartments on Taris, homeworld of The Twisted Rancor Trio. Though he had taken care to set up a holographic security system employing a Holo-Sec Corp anti-theft explosive around the package to secure it from robbery before Uksaris could retrieve it, the package's contents were lost anyway to the amnesiac former Dark Lord of the Sith Revan, who managed to deactivate the system with the aid of Uksaris's draft memoir Guts and Glory: A Chronicle of The Amazing Story of The Twisted Rancor Trio."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3956 BBY, Gilthos Uksaris, founder of the jatz band The Twisted Rancor Trio had received an invitation from Davik Kang, crime lord of the Exchange, to perform at his estate. Because of Kang's reputation for criminal violence, Giltho Uksaris's friend was apprehensive of the wisdom of Uksaris accepting the offer and warned him as such. His fears were shared by the band's lead singer, Elinda, who resolutely refused to perform for Kang, yet Uksaris maintained that Kang's patronage was the opportunity the band had been waiting for a grand touring contract."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Uksaris's solution to Elinda's absence was to replace her with her sister Ashana on the eve of their scheduled appearance at Kang's estate, untested and without much time for rehearsal. That day, Uksaris's friend sent him a package containing a suit of Echani fiber armor and 50 credits as he had previously promised. Delivered to Uksaris's apartment in the Lower City Apartments of the planet Taris, The Twisted Rancor Trio's homeworld, the package was held within a security crate secured by a Holo-Sec Corp anti-theft explosive as part of a holographic security system. This security system employed six holoprojectors for its passcode. Uksaris's friend had set each holoprojector to correspond to each of the six individuals who had performed with the band at one point or another, and to disarm the trap, Uksaris was expected to activate each holoprojector in chronological order of their recruitment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The friend had anticipated that the passcode would therefore be easy for Uksaris to deduce, given that Uksaris was the band's manager. He left a message along with the delivery specifying the instructions to safely disarm the explosive, as well as reiterating his concerns that replacing Elinda with Ashana was a mistake, noting that Kang might even have the band killed for unsatisfactory performance. Nevertheless, he ended his message on an optimistic tone, wishing Uksaris good luck and reminding him that should Uksaris's gamble succeed, it would provide an excellent chapter for Uksaris's memoir on the band's exploits, Guts and Glory: A Chronicle of The Amazing Story of The Twisted Rancor Trio."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a matter of fact, Uksaris never received his friend's package thanks to the theft of the amnesiac former Dark Lord of the Sith Revan. Revan, then serving with the Galactic Republic, had been stranded on Taris with fellow Republic Captain Carth Onasi after their warship, the Endar Spire, was destroyed by a Sith ambush above the planet. The Sith Empire subsequently enacted a planet-wide blockade in the hopes of preventing their query, the Jedi Bastila Shan from escaping, and during his search for Shan, Revan chanced upon Uksaris's apartment in the Lower City, where he encountered the security crate while Uksaris was away. Finding a draft of Guts and Glory on a nearby table, Revan was able to decipher the passcode after reading the history of the band. As a result, he disarmed the anti-theft explosive without issue and retrieved the Echani fiber armor and 50 credits for his own use."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The friend of Gilthos Uksaris is only mentioned in the 2003 video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic as the sender of a message and accompanying security crate to Uksaris found at an apartment in the Lower City Apartments (East) area. The message is accessed upon interaction with the security crate and details the instructions to unlocking it safely without triggering the explosive that it is rigged with. As given by the message, the passcode is to activate each of the six holoprojectors of The Twisted Rancor Trio's band members in order of their recruitment, and this order can be deduced by reading the datapad on Guts and Glory: A Chronicle of The Amazing Story of The Twisted Rancor Trio in the same room that provides a history of the band. The player, as Revan, can either safely unlock the crate through these steps, fail and trigger the explosive trap, or ignore the crate and move on without looting it. If the player triggers the explosion but manages to survive it, such as by leaving one or more party member standing in a safe distance from the blast radius, the crate will then be unlocked for looting without bypassing the security system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
