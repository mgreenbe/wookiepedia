It was one of a chain intended to protect the cloning facilities on Kamino during the Clone Wars. As a usually-quiet posting, it was mostly staffed by rookie clone troopers part of a unit led by Clone Sergeant \"O'Niner.\" Clones stationed there were prohibited from leaving the station because of dangerous creatures such as the Rishi eels found on the moon. For the most part, clones in service on the station had little to do except monitor movement of ships nearby."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the first year of the war, the clones of Domino Squad, CT-782 \"Hevy,\" CT-1409 \"Echo,\" CT-5555 \"Fives,\" and CT-4040 \"Cutup,\" and CT-00-2010 \"Droidbait,\" were deployed to the station. Soon after, it was attacked by Separatist commando droids who hardwired the base's all-clear signal as part of a plan by General Grievous to attack Kamino. In order to stop the signal and alert the Republic Military to the planned invasion, the surviving clones, Hevy, Echo, and Fives, joined Clone Captain \"Rex,\" and Clone Commander CC-2224 \"Cody,\" to retake the base and resorted to destroying Rishi Station altogether, with Hevy sacrificing himself to do so."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The base itself had a communications relay and an observation platform that served as a landing platform.
