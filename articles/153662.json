The Kloperians were installing detonators in the starfighters on behalf of the Dark Jedi Kueller. This mechanic found R2-D2 jacked into a computer terminal where the astromech droid was not authorized to be. The Kloperian took the droid and its counterpart, C-3PO, into the hangar bay where the Kloperians were working and locked them into a closet.
