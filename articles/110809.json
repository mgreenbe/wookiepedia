Still considering her to be his true daughter, D'Asta commanded his armada in an attack on Ord Cantrell, headquarters of the Council.

For five years after 6 ABY, D'Asta had no contact with his daughter. Unbeknownst to the other members of the Council and her own father, Feena was kidnapped in 7 ABY and replaced with a clone by the criminal organization Black Sun, who used the clone to stake their own interests on the Council while Feena was kept imprisoned by their ally Grappa the Hutt. D'Asta had no contact with the clone either, and he remained unaware of the switch.

By arranging the assassinations of a number of prominent councilors, Carivus ensured his election as head of the Council. The clone Feena believed him to be ineffectual and opposed him, but she received little support from the rest of the body. Eventually, Carivus had all non-Human members of the Council arrested, claiming suspicion that they were behind the assassinations, and arrested the clone Feena as well, accusing her of being a traitor. Councilor Mahd Windcaller warned Carivus that D'Asta would break from the Empire, inciting others to join him in rebellion. Carivus ignored her concerns, however, considering D'Asta to be too sick and old to be a threat. Windcaller and other members of the Council later met to decide what was to be done about D'Asta and other problems besetting the Empire.

Moments after the admiral in charge of the world's defense lost communications with Carivus in the Council Tower, D'Asta contacted the ersatz Emperor from his flagship, a Marauder-class corvette, informing him that his fleets were in ruin and his fate was sealed. With D'Asta's starfighters attacking the Council Tower itself, Carivus gave in and released Feena, on the condition that D'Asta would cease hostilities. Though irritated that he would be calling off his attack short of victory, D'Asta accepted.

The clone drew a blaster on the real Feena, but D'Asta disarmed her and demanded an explanation from Sinn. When D'Asta questioned her, the clone Feena confessed. Kanos, who sought to avenge all the conspirators who had killed Palpatine, drew his blade on the clone, demanding her life.

Carivus did not believe D'Asta would reveal the plot, as his daughter had supposedly been part of the conspiracy, but when D'Asta told him that it had actually been a clone of her, Carivus declared them all traitors and ordered his personal guards to arrest them. Just then Kanos arrived, and Carivus commanded his guards to kill everyone in the room.

Cornering him, the Royal Guardsman ended the life of the self-proclaimed Emperor. D'Asta and the others arrived shortly thereafter, as Kanos decided he would spare the imprisoned members of the former Council. With that, the war against the conspirators was ended; D'Asta still desired revenge on Grappa the Hutt, but unknown to him, Grappa was at that moment en route to be sacrificed by his former allies, the Zanibar species.

However, after falling ill, D'Asta sent his daughter to the meeting as his proxy.

Kanos, discovering the emblem of the Restored Empire tattooed upon the assailants' wrists, opted to personally deliver Feena's body to her father. Kanos explained the situation to Baron D'Asta: by attacking the peace summit, Devian would frame the act on the New Republic and force Admiral Pellaeon into launching a retaliatory strike on Coruscant, which would leave Orinda undefended, allowing for Devian to strike and usurp the power of the Imperial Remnant. D'Asta made contact with Pellaeon and urged him to call off the attack on Coruscant. D'Asta and Pellaeon formed a battleplan: Pellaeon's fleet would distract the hardliners while three of D'Asta's fleets lay in wait behind Orinda's moon. Accompanied by Kanos, Sinn, and the clone of his daughter Feena, D'Asta launched the attack on the hardliner fleet and boarded Pellaeon's flagship, which was being overrun by Devian's forces. D'Asta narrowly saved Pellaeon from execution at the hands of Devian, and used his daughter's clone as a decoy in order to confuse Devian into believing he had failed at murdering Feena.
