They were both located in isolated areas near the city of Doaba Guerfel and heavily defended. Four of the nine Chirq Council elite councilors were based in the First Elite Council Bunker, Rallyn Secura, Mathazar Zayet, Crale Forte and Atlan Dubreas, while the five others were based in the Second Elite Council Bunker. The First Elite Council Bunker was also used by Chirq Council chemists for the development of bioweapons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 1 ABY, the Corellian Security Force started an investigation against the Chirq Council following the increase of ryll traffic on Corellia. Captain Vitala Baize infiltrated a CorSec agent in Jzoro Quanera's Chirq Council cell in Doaba Guerfel. From Quanera's database, the CorSec obtained the identity of the nine elite councilors and the locations of their two secret headquarters. The Corsec first raided the First Second Elite Council Bunker. CorSec forces assaulted the buildings and eliminated most of the guards. Following orders from CorSec Agent Teniel Waray, the CorSec troops also collected data about the Chirq Council bioweapons and killed several chemists. They also found in the bunker the body of Vryim Raeth, an innocent man assassinated by the Council. The CorSec eventually killed half of the elite councilors in the depths of the bunker. After the death of all the other elite councilors during the subsequent CorSec assault on the Second Elite Council Bunker, the Chirq Council splintered."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The First Elite Council Bunker appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
