Distantly related to the feline krak'jya, the skar'kla had evolutionarily diverged from its relative to adapt more for speed rather than power. Stealthy hunters that relied on quick, sudden bursts of activity, skar'kla were often found in Bothawui's mountains and far from civilized areas.\nThis being noted, the decrease in krak'jya numbers due to high pelt demands resulted in more and more brazen skar'kla attacks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
