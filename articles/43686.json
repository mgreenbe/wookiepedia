The drink was so named because the active ingredients created a fizzy effect which formed a miniature cloud of ionized gas above the glass. The drink was often served in containers that fired tiny microshocks into the cloud to simulate an electrical storm. The Elshandruu Pica Thundercloud was considered to be one of the strongest in the galaxy, making it highly dangerous. The drink was served at the Meltdown Caf\u00e9 on the planet Nar Shaddaa. The bounty hunter, Spurch Goa, regularly consumed Pica Thunderclouds wherever he went."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
