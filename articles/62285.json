Generally speaking, a being's homeworld was their place of birth. Such was the case of Darth Maul and Asajj Ventress, who were both born on Dathomir and called that planet their own home. In some cases, however, an individual's homeworld was the planet on which he or she was raised."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The term homeworld could also refer to the planet of origin of an organization or species. As such, Moraband was considered the ancient homeworld of the Sith Order, while Kashyyyk was the homeworld of the Wookiee species. The Galactic Empire attempted to train loyalty to homeworlds out of cadets training at their Imperial Academies, as it felt that such loyalties detracted from one's service to the greater Empire. An individual might consider a particular planet their \"adopted homeworld\" if they had lived on it for a long time and come to appreciate it, even if not born there. Zare Leonis came to think of Lothal as his adopted homeworld despite having been born on Uquine and not having moved to Lothal until he was fourteen years of age."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the term itself was \"homeworld,\" it could in some cases refer to a habitable moon or a region of space. Pantora, the primary moon of Orto Plutonia, was the homeworld of the Pantoran species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
