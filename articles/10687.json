At some point in 19 BBY, the fleet was infiltrated by a squad of Republic droids led by the Zilkin Colonel Meebur Gascon, who were sent to steal an encryption module from the Providence-class Dreadnought flagship to decipher an intercepted and encoded transmission of General Grievous and discover what the Confederacy was planning."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fleet first appeared, albeit unidentified, in \"Secret Weapons,\" the tenth episode of the animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars' fifth season, which originally aired on November 30, 2012."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
