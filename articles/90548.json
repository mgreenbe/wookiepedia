A signal from the mining array's computer set a timer; after this counted down, sub-surface charges detonated. This was helpful in certain types of mining, as that practiced on the planet Viidaav. Mining arrays could be housed in fortified bunkers with automated defense systems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
