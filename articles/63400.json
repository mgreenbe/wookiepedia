There were two ways to gain sponsorship: One either had to become a Mandalorian, a process that would take too long considering the competition was nearly beginning, or gain the favor of a powerful crime lord. As it so happened, Suudaa Nem'ro was one who had not yet sponsored a hunter.

Acknowledging that he was beaten, Carter told the Hunter that Corellia will outlast the Empire, but his opponent did not care for his idealism and froze him in carbonite."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hunter journeyed to Capitol Square to deliver Carter to Tormen in the Grand Assembly. Once all the representatives had been captured and thawed, Tormen then forced them into signing a treaty signifying Corellia's legitimate secession from the Republic. Prime Minister Cal Falcone addressed the politicians on Coruscant, demanding that the Supreme Chancellor come to Corellia to ratify the treaty and acknowledge the planet as a member of the Sith Empire. Soon after his announcement, Falcone was executed by Tormen via Force-choke for failing to bring the resistance to heel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hunter then patiently waited before being informed by Tormen that a Republic fleet, led by the Founder, Janarus' flagship, had just arrived in the system. He predicted that Seros would rally the Green Jedi to aid the Republic in one last offensive, giving the Hunter a window to infiltrate the Green Gardens and exact vengeance. Tormen instructed the Hunter to discreetly kill Seros and then recover his effects."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon confronting the Jedi battlemaster, Seros refused his fellow Jedi's offer of aid and dispatched them on an unknown task. He then criticized the Hunter for murdering Kellian Jarro and all those sent to capture him, stating that he could've surrender at anytime, instead choosing a path of violence. In turn, the Hunter accused Seros of kill his fellow Champions and framing him for crimes he did not commit. The Jedi admitted that he did use the Hunter as a red herring to expose the Sith's true colors before readying himself for battle and engaged the Hunter. The Hunter ultimately came out victorious and stood over the defeated Jedi. Seros retorted that despite his failure, he had ensured that everything the Hunter had accomplished had been undone. Refusing to let Seros have the last laugh, the Hunter taunted that Janarus was next before fatally shooting Seros, letting him die with regret."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hunter then returned to the Grand Assembly, where Tormen was fighting off a group of Green Jedi and assisted the Sith against them.

Once aboard, the Hunter would destroy any and all space-capable ships to prevent Janarus from escaping and then fight through the Supreme Guard to get to him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hunter followed through this plan to the letter, eventually reaching the Supreme Chancellor. Once confronted, Janarus requested that he be allowed to speak. He revealed that he had just discovered the immense cost of the operation to apprehend the Hunter and condemned Seros' abuse of power in his vendetta against the Hunter. He didn't condone the Hunter's actions but he understood that bounty hunting was their job. Janarus explained that he had already declassified the Hunter and Seros' actions to the public, clearing the Hunter's name of the false crimes, thus creating a political maelstrom that would effectively result in his removal from office. He offered to grant the Hunter immunity for their true crimes in exchange for assassinating Tormen, revealing that the Hunter's employer had been performing massacres on Corellia and Rabaan and Janarus wanted to prevent him from gaining more power. The Hunter refused and killed Janarus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hunter then met Tormen aboard the Tyrant, who declared that the two of them had just made their place in history and said he would later require use of the Hunter's skills, to which the Hunter agreed, on the condition that his credits were good."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Grand Champion, like many other bounty hunters, was a gruff, unpredictable character with a dark sense of humor.
