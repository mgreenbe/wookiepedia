It was one of several hospitals that had a stock of rakghoul serum, and centuries later its ruins were raided by the Death's Claw pirates for the serum. Doctor Ianna Cel appealed to Commander Viqui of the Republic Army to step in, but as Sepanik had not been a Republic hospital, the pirates had legal salvage rights."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
