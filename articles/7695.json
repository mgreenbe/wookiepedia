The warship collected the evacuees from the destroyed Mon Calamari cruiser Maximus. Soon afterward, being in need of supplies, she was boarded by the CR90 corvette Lauhu, but during that operation she was endangered by an assault led by the Imperial escort frigate Firelance. This attack severely damaged the frigate and there was no time to repair it. The Imperial CR90 corvette Viper was patrolling the area for its task force. The frigate was evacuated and the corvette Hart sent transports to collect the personnel. Then, following orders, Rebel pilot Keyan Farlander destroyed the carcass of the frigate to prevent it falling into Imperial hands."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
