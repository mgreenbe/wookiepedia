Based on the art style of the show, it was released in digest-sized format and is similar to Clone Wars Adventures, but contains a single story instead of several. The graphic novellas also coincided with the monthly Star Wars: The Clone Wars comic issues, which were later collected in Trade Paperbacks, in the same sized format as the digest-sized graphic novellas. The issues were released at irregular dates until the series ended in 2013."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
