It was a small rocky planetoid and covered in impact craters. The planet was used by Byro Ti'mere to distract visitors and bounty hunters searching for his secret base on Brugga. Ti'mere established the ruins of an outpost on the planet to throw off suspicions that he was still operating out of the Latoma system and convince them he had moved elsewhere."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
