The tallest of their kind were scarcely waist-high to a Human. The soles of their feet were thick, calloused pads. The species were adept at the disciplines of bioengineering and genetics, creating many animals including the Asgnat and Grebnar. They were seemingly descended from herbivoral stock and evolved to the point that they banded together into extended family units. This was partly a defensive mechanism as it allowed them to adequately protect one another from dangerous predators on their world. As true intelligence began to emerge amongst the species, social evolution allowed for a true understanding of the nature of their environment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their planet lacked any readily accessible resources such as wood and metal. However, the cold world of Lur had an abundance of lifeforms on its surface, including both animals and plants. The Lurrians first began to domesticate certain creatures, which initially led to them being used as food but eventually evolved into transportation and finally as construction tools. In time, they began to engage in selective breeding in order to bring about desirable traits in their lifeforms. They quickly began to learn that various herbs and similar compounds also had an impact on the genetic code of offspring and thus tapped into the art of bioengineering living organisms. As such, they genetically engineered creatures that ranged from construction to guard creatures, which served as an alternative to traditional forms of technology."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lurrian society also evolved into a peaceful culture, and their long lives were often filled with joy and recreational activities. They were highly social beings and lived in cities that held several thousand each. In addition, family connections were strong amongst their people, and violence was rare amongst the Lurrians. Lurrian slaves could fetch between four and six thousand apiece on the Invisible Market."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lurrians had developed the art of bioengineering entirely on their own and had bred numerous genetically engineered organisms on their world. Despite their talent, they preferred to remain on their homeworld, and many did not take part in contracts for genetic research with outsiders. After the Clone Wars ended, they were one of a number of species that were enslaved by the Galactic Empire. Once this was done, the Empire placed a number of rigid restrictions on cloning and genetic research, though not everyone was happy with these imposed laws."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The employers of Zlarb and Magg both desired to make use of the Lurrians' talents, though the species refused to take part in any contract of employment. This led to the two slavers abducting fifty Lurrians in order to sell them offworld and hiring Han Solo early in his smuggling career. The Corellian was, however, completely unaware of the transportation of slaves, and after discovering it, he freed the enslaved Lurrians from the slave traders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Yuuzhan Vong War many New Republic scientists came to study Lurrian bioengineering."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
