In 3 ABY, ZED-6-7 accompanied the Sith Lord Darth Vader on his search for those responsible for hiding Luke Skywalker, rebel pilot and secretly Vader's son. When ZED-6-7 met Vader, the Sith Lord adjusted the forensics droid's motivator, forcing the droid to self-destruct if it ever revealed their mission. While attempting to investigate the late Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, Skywalker's mother, Vader and ZED-6-7 encountered Sab\u00e9, a former handmaiden of Amidala who was seeking information about her death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Investigation on Tatooine"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the Galactic Empire, ZED-6-7 served as a forensics droid for the regime. In 3 ABY, ZED-6-7 was summoned to assist the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Vader intended to search for the Rebel Alliance pilot who destroyed the Death Star, Luke Skywalker, who, unbeknownst to the droid, was Vader's own son. ZED-6-7 reported to the Sith Lord aboard his flagship Executor, boarding a shuttle alongside a unit of death troopers. Aboard the shuttle, Darth Vader approached ZED-6-7, adjusting the droid's motivator to force it to self-destruct if it revealed any details about their mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Vader's threat, ZED-6-7 requested to know what Vader's mission would involve. Vader gave the droid Skywalker's name, and ZED-6-7 reported that the rebel pilot had gone missing. However, Vader did not wish to seek out Skywalker himself\u2014his intent was to track down and destroy those who hid his son from him. ZED-6-7 proposed to first start where Skywalker was first seen, the desert planet Tatooine. Their shuttle landed at an Imperial facility, and they were greeted by Lieutenant Ardo Banch. ZED-6-7 requested to use a terminal with local records, finding the location of Skywalker's childhood home, the moisture farm of the Lars family. As Vader and ZED-6-7 explored the home, the forensics droid recounted the history of its owners."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they left the moisture farm, ZED-6-7 detected objects beneath the surface of the ground, and discovered the graves of Cliegg Lars, former owner of the house, and his wife, Shmi Skywalker Lars, who, unknown to ZED-6-7, was the mother of Vader, formerly Anakin Skywalker. Angered by the memory of losing his mother, Vader used the Force to push away the sand in the nearby area, knocking ZED-6-7 aside. As Lieutenant Banch approached to inform Vader of transmissions he had picked up, a gang of criminals attacked the Imperial forces, destroying Banch's vehicle. ZED-6-7 attempted to suggest moving away from the resulting explosion, but Vader remained standing where he was. Vader used the Force to crash the criminals' U-wing, and killed the criminals with his lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Following Amidala"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the criminals dead, ZED-6-7 asked if their mission was finished, but Vader had further plans. They traveled to the planet Coruscant, visiting the abandoned apartment of the late Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala. The forensics droid questioned the purpose of the visit, and Vader revealed that Amidala was Skywalker's mother. The information led ZED-6-7 to conclude that the Jedi Anakin Skywalker was the father."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, ZED-6-7 was unable to confirm whether Amidala's son had been taken to the apartment after her death, as the security records at the time had been deleted. ZED-6-7 surmised that someone had something to hide, discovering a scout transmitter hidden in the apartment. After analyzing the spy droid to learn who it was reporting to, ZED-6-7 led Vader to the planet Vendaxa, in the Expansion Region. Before arriving at Vendaxa, ZED-6-7 accompanied Vader to a cantina, where the Sith Lord killed a man who had been posing as Luke Skywalker. The two departed for Vendaxa, and the trail led to a facility that was under attack from native Vendaxan land squid, which Vader killed. Upon entering the facility, Vader and ZED-6-7 saw an individual who appeared to be Amidala. ZED-6-7 noted the similarity between Amidala and the woman, who claimed to be the late senator back from the dead. Vader Force choked the woman, and ZED-6-7 remarked on her mistake."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The queen's shadow"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Vader was unable to kill the woman, who escaped, and ZED-6-7 attempted to warn the Sith Lord. The two were attacked by more Vendaxan land squid, which Vader killed, and ZED-6-7 tracked down the supposed Amidala, who Vader deduced to be a former handmaiden of Amidala when she had been the queen of her homeworld of Naboo. ZED-6-7 compared the handmaiden to its Imperial databank, identifying her as Sab\u00e9, the queen's double. Vader concluded that it had been Sab\u00e9 who visited the apartment, and Sab\u00e9 accused the Emperor of being behind Amidala's death. Vader lied to Sab\u00e9, claiming that he was hunting down those who had hidden Amidala in revenge for her death, which convinced the former handmaiden to work alongside him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "ZED-6-7 accompanied Vader and Sab\u00e9 as they fought off the remaining Vendaxan land squid, leaving the facility. Sab\u00e9 ordered ZED-6-7 to help her bury her crew of soldiers, who had died fighting off the creatures. ZED-6-7 protested, arguing that it was not built for manual labor, but Vader forced the forensics droid to obey Sab\u00e9's order. ZED-6-7 reluctantly buried the dead soldiers, watching as Sab\u00e9 mourned them. Following the burial, Sab\u00e9 led Vader and ZED-6-7 to Naboo, where she had hidden the security recordings from Amidala's apartment."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Voyage on Naboo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arriving in the planet's Lake Country, ZED-6-7 remarked on the excitement of journeying to Naboo and accompanied Vader and Sab\u00e9 to Varykino, the lake retreat of Amidala's family. The droid inquired why the former handmaiden had brought them there in search of the recordings, prompting the woman to confess she did not know the exact location of the files. In that moment, Vader was attacked by two men, though the Dark Lord of the Sith easily gained the upper hand. ZED-6-7 observed that the attackers had made a grave mistake, but Sab\u00e9 convinced Vader to leave them alive, revealing them to be her associates Gregar Typho and Tonra, veterans of the Royal Naboo Security Forces who claimed to have hidden the recordings on Naboo. ZED-6-7 and Vader followed the group to the lower levels of Varykino, boarding a Gungan bongo submarine and voyaging into the depths of the planet's waterways."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droid examined its new allies during the journey, questioning them on their activities related to Amidala. Analyzing its databanks, ZED-6-7 determined that Captain Typho had witnessed multiple assassination attempts against Amidala during the Separatist Crisis, causing the officer to believe that the droid was questioning his loyalty to his queen, though it mused that it was simply collecting relevant data. Later, it turned its attention to Tonra, an individual whose history following the Invasion of Naboo was unknown to the droid. As the man explained that he had gone undercover on a mission with Sab\u00e9, the group's bongo was attacked by carnivorous colo claw fish. ZED-6-7 noted the creatures to be uncommon in the shallow waters they journeyed through and speculated that the eels had been drawn by the whining noise of their Gungan vessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fish bit into the bongo with their massive jaws, compromising the hull and ejecting the passengers into the water. Tonra attempted to use the droid as a shield against the beasts, an action ZED-6-7 noted would be useless if the creatures swallowed them all whole. Vader, however, subdued the fish, prompting the droid to encourage its companions to thank the Sith Lord, though it surmised that the organics would soon perish without oxygen. Tonra led the group to their destination, an underwater Gungan structure. ZED-6-7 took note of a mural within that depicted the aftermath of the Battle of Naboo, an event Vader witnessed as a child. The Dark Lord destroyed the artwork in anger."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Entrapment under the sea"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Vader requested that the recordings be immediately given to him, Tonra challenged him and asked if he truly sought to avenge Amidala's death. After ZED-6-7 advised the captain that it was in his best interest to proceed quickly, Tonra produced a holographic device from a hidden chamber in the structure. ZED-6-7's Imperial programming allowed it to easily bypass the outdated Republic code and produce the recordings Vader sought. The footage depicted a young woman speaking to small a group of individuals, whom the droid determined to be Sab\u00e9, Typho, Tonra, and others."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the recordings, the group christened themselves the Amidalans and swore to kill those responsible for their queen's death. After realizing that they had not found the clues they had been promised, ZED-6-7 questioned why Sab\u00e9 had deceived them if they all wanted to eliminate the same targets. The handmaiden revealed that the Amidalans suspected Vader as the culprit all along and had brought him to Naboo to kill him. With the ruse discovered, Tonra activated a device, summoning an enormous sando aqua monster to destroy the facility."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An Imperial forensics droid, ZED-6-7, known as Zed Six Seven, was the same model as the SP-4 ISC crime scene analysis droids formerly used by the Jedi Order. ZED-6-7 had plating colored in various shades of brown and had blue photoreceptors. The droid stood at a height shorter than 2.03 meters. As a forensics droid, ZED-6-7 was not constructed for undertaking manual labor and objected to doing so."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "ZED-6-7 was eager to serve and analyze data. Upon noticing death troopers when reporting to Vader, ZED-6-7 was pleased that it would have plenty to analyze. When Vader adjusted the forensics droid's motivator to force it to self-destruct if the details of their mission were revealed, ZED-6-7 was surprised but mostly unfazed. ZED-6-7 was a skilled analyst, able to use its extensive database to make deductions. The forensics droid could scan an individual's traits, including physical features and voice, and determine their identity based on cross-referencing its database. It could also detect heat signatures to track individuals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Serving under a Dark Lord of the Sith, ZED-6-7 was enthusiastically loyal to Darth Vader. It eagerly anticipated the occasions upon which the Emperor's servant could deliver violent judgement, watching with excitement as Vader fought against the likes of Sab\u00e9 and the Amidalans. The droid was surprised that individuals like Typho and Tonra could think to kill the Sith Lord and believed that transgressions of that sort would not go unpunished."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When ZED-6-7 was summoned to assist Darth Vader, the forensics droid brought a number of boxes containing equipment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "ZED-6-7 first appeared in Darth Vader 1, a comic written by Greg Pak, illustrated by Raffaele Ienco, and published by Marvel Comics on February 5, 2020.
