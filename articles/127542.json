A number of simple signals could be produced, which conveyed different meanings. The language could be learned by non-Slith also; a number of Gerb learned this skill as a self-defense mechanism. Since Slith lacked vocal cords, they were unable to speak Basic, and while they were able to produce some vocal noises, the unavoidable consequence of moisture evaporation discouraged this developing into an actual language."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
