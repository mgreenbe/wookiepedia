The article continues on with his rise to power from a mere Senator to being elected as the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic, then followed by the Clone Wars which Palpatine orchestrated. The final part is Palpatine's ascent as the Emperor of the Galactic Empire, his eventual death aboard the Second Death Star and his later appearances in clone bodies.
