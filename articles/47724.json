Frisk predominantly flew a BTL Y-wing starfighter. The squadron served in the Bormea sector around 5 ABY, but soon traveled to the planet Troithe to assist General Hera Syndulla's Barma Battle Group against the Galactic Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing. When the fighter wing launched a bulk freighter in an attempt to escape, Tssat, one of Syndulla's pilots, asked Wyl Lark where the squadron commander wanted Vanguard Squadron.

When Feresk, by his own accounts, accidentally procured a counterfeit painting for an Imperial governor, who in turn showed it to Admiral Thrawn, a death mark was placed on Feresk's head, forcing him to find sanctuary with the Alliance to Restore the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, Feresk Tssat served as a pilot in the New Republic's Vanguard Squadron. Around 5 ABY, the squadron was on a special assignment in the Bormea sector to help improve the New Republic's starship supply. General Hera Syndulla brought some forces to assist Vanguard Squadron, but soon received news that her own battle group had been devastated by the Galactic Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing during its campaign in the Cerberon system. Syndulla subsequently took Vanguard Squadron, Tssat included, and the squadron's headquarters, the MC75 Star Cruiser Temperance, to the Cerberon system, where some of her battle group's remaining forces were fighting the 204th at the planet Troithe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The squadron engaged the fighter wing, which soon launched a bulk freighter from the surface of Troithe in an attempt to escape. As one Vanguard pilot reported a 204th squadron seemingly docking into the freighter, Tssat asked Wyl Lark,a senior pilot from Syndulla's remaining forces, where the squadron commander wanted Vanguard Squadron. Lark attempted to make the fighter wing surrender, but chose to have the New Republic forces pursue the bulk freighter when the enemy did not comply. Ultimately, the 204th launched missiles to distract the New Republic, and the fighter wing escaped aboard the freighter while under pursuit from Vanguard pilots."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Feresk was a Transdoshan male with pale pink scales and orange eyes.
