The squat, scaly reptilians walked on four three-clawed legs. Their roughly triangular heads held piercing yellow eyes, and jaws that were filled with sharp teeth that jutted out when their mouths were closed. Three rows of spikes ran down the beasts' backs to the ends of their tails."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behavior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kell dragons generally attempted to neutralize their targets by biting with their toothy jaws.
