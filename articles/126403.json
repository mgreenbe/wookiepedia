She admired what Luke had done against the Galactic Empire, having even some sympathies for the Alliance to Restore the Republic, but she needed money."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Prince Xizor of the Black Sun posted bounty on Luke Skywalker's head, Skahtul had accepted the contract. She tracked Skywalker to Tatooine where, in a cantina, met an Imperial operative, who would provide her with backup. The two planned to ambush Skywalker when he would approach Xizor, observing the Mos Espa Race. Xizor Transport Company had provided several large luxury sand barges from which spectators could watch the race; Skahtul was allowed onto Xizor's personal barge, where she waited for Skywalker to arrive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After finally spotting the young Jedi, Skahtul stepped in front of him, armed with a heavy blaster pistol. However, Skywalker was more then ready for the encounter, because he had lured the bounty hunter into his trap, and not the other way around. During the battle an errant blaster bolt hit the steering vane for the sail barge, and it began to careen out of control. Following the barge's crash into sand, Skahtul saw no sign of the Jedi, but was determined to continue her pursuit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3.5 ABY, Skahtul led a coalition of bounty hunters to Kothlis, where they finally captured Luke Skywalker. Skywalker was wanted dead by Xizor, but alive by Vader. As such, Skahtul kept Skywalker in a compound on Kothlis while she tried to get the highest price out of them. This backfired, as Skywalker escaped the compound with the help of Lando Calrissian."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A year later, Skahtul was on Hurd's Moon and met with Savan, the niece of Xizor, who was on a mission to capture the Human replica droid Guri. Guri was under the protection of her creator, the droid scientist Massad Thrumble. Skahtul advised Savan to wait until Guri left before launching her attack, though Savan ignored her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
