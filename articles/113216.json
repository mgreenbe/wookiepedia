He was raised by Human slaves, and thus never learned the ways of his culture. Reerookachuck developed a nefarious personality, going to drastic measures to hold on to his freedom. He was eventually taken captive by a group of slavers from the Sord Montok corporation. As he was being transported to a new location, Reerookachuck decided it was time to escape. He started a riot aboard the ship, which led to the deaths of twenty slavers. Reerookachuck took over the ship, Sord Montok, and fled into space. Soon after the incident, the Sord Montok corporation placed a bounty for Reerookachucks' capture."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
