During the Clone Wars, a pair of Separatist XT Beetles were bundled together by large cables to form an outpost on the planet Orto Plutonia. However, their battle droid occupants were destroyed by Talz warriors from a nearby village. The vacant XT Beetles were later used as a neutral meeting ground for negotiations between the Pantorans, the inhabitants of the planet's primary moon of Pantora, who claimed Orto Plutonia as their protectorate and regarded the natives as trespassers, and the indigenous Talz, who simply desired to be left alone."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The XT Beetle Transport first appeared, albeit unidentified, in \"Trespass,\" the fifteenth episode of the canon animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars' first season, which originally aired on January 30, 2009.
