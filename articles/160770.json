The casing of the weapon provided some concealment of the blades, as it was not uncommon for the very tips of the blades to peek out from between the backs of the knuckles. The wielder could activate the weapon with a squeeze of the fist. Vibroknucklers required an energy cell to operate properly, though the weapon could still be used unpowered with slightly diminished force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though restricted in most systems, vibroknucklers were commonly found across the galaxy.
