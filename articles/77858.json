The exterior of the vault complex was grown from the mass of one of these Mind Spiders during its larval stage and shaped by Imperial engineers using sonic vibrations to control the slug's growth cycle. They constructed (grew) the vault on the precipice of a large ravine and safeguarded it with an impregnable energy field. The crystalline support struts securing the vault within the ravine were actually the legs of the slug-like creature. The interior of the vault, however, resembled a standard Imperial military facility and boasted a full complement of officers, staff and guards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Three years after the Battle of Yavin, Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca the Wookiee infiltrated Krake's vault in order to steal pertinent information relating to the former Rogue Squadron pilot Shira Brie. After fighting through a squad of Imperial stormtroopers, they managed to steal the information they required and escape from the outpost. Upon evacuating, Luke used the deflector screens of the Millennium Falcon to cause a massive explosion at the vault, destroying it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
