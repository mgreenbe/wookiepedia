After launching the Bulwark Fleet from the Foerost Shipyards, Confederate Admiral Dua Ningo initiated an intense campaign against the Core Worlds, coming close to seizing Coruscant itself. The Victory Fleet's commanders, Captains Jan Dodonna and Terrinald Screed, hunted down Ningo and engaged his Bulwark Mark I battlecruisers in a deciding clash over the planet Anaxes. Although Screed outmaneuvered and vaporized Ningo's flagship, killing the Separatist admiral, Screed's assault cost him damage to his own command ship, resulting in near-mortal injuries that forced him to undergo cybernetic reconstruction. Nevertheless, he and Dodonna both received the Holt Cross for their victorious actions over Anaxes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 20.1 BBY (15:4), twenty-three months into the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems unveiled its new Bulwark Fleet of Bulwark Mark I battlecruisers.

In response, two Republic officers\u2014Captains Terrinald Screed and Jan Dodonna\u2014were granted command of the latest addition to the Republic Navy: the Victory Fleet of Victory I-class Star Destroyers, designed by Rendili StarDrive engineer Walex Blissex."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Screed and Dodonna chased Ningo away from Coruscant and pursued him throughout the Core Worlds.

Screed, meanwhile, sat a mere hyperspace jump away aboard his command ship, the Arlionne, waiting for the right moment to join the battle. Commanding the Bulwark Fleet from his flagship, the Unrepentant, Ningo decimated Dodonna's warships, plunging dead wreck after dead wreck toward the surface below. Despite the carnage, Dodonna held out against Ningo's ships long enough for Screed to execute his sneak attack. Emerging from hyperspace aboard the Arlionne, Screed maneuvered his Star Destroyer into position and ambushed the Unrepentant at point-blank range. His swift salvo of broadside cannonades annihilated Ningo's flagship, killing the Confederate admiral. However, the ensuing explosion of the Unrepentant tore into the Arlionne, ripping open its bridge and severely wounding Screed. Nevertheless, Ningo's death allowed Screed and Dodonna to emerge victorious over the late admiral's Bulwark Fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Screed needed cybernetic implants to survive his near-mortal injuries, but he began to recover and\u2014within three weeks of the Battle of Anaxes, as it came to be known\u2014laboriously returned to Anaxes to receive the Holt Cross medal alongside Dodonna, in recognition of their defeat of the Bulwark Fleet. Screed and Dodonna were lauded as heroes of the Republic, and both men continued their careers in the Republic Navy.

Among the research that he did for the book, Wallace drew upon the concept of the Victory I-class Star Destroyer from the 1979 novel Han Solo's Revenge, using the Battle of Anaxes and the surrounding events to chronicle the Star Destroyer's formal in-universe introduction. The battle has since been referenced and expanded by other authors, including Jason Fry, who co-authored 2012's The Essential Guide to Warfare and detailed the battle's events in a profile for Terrinald Screed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
