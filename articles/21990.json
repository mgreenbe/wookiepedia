In 22 BBY, on his first mission with Koon, Wolffe served on board the Jedi Master's flagship, the Triumphant, when Koon led a task force to eliminate the Separatist warship Malevolence. While confronting the Malevolence in the Abregado system, however, all of the Wolfpack was eliminated, save for Koon, Wolffe, and troopers Sinker and Boost. The four were rescued by Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, and Wolffe had his unit adopt new clone trooper armor in honor of his fallen comrades.

In actuality, the weapon was the ion cannon\u2013equipped battlecruiser Malevolence, commanded by the Confederate General Grievous. As he was on an out-of-armor duty rotation, Commander Wolffe served as the first officer on board Koon's flagship, the Star Destroyer Triumphant. Tracking the superweapon to the Abregado system, Koon's task force of three Venator-class Star Destroyers arrived and approached the massive Separatist warship, which Wolffe reported to be holding its position. When Koon recommended that they report their position before commencing attack on the superweapon, Wolffe offered that Jedi General Anakin Skywalker's fleet was stationed in the nearby Bith system, and Koon and Wolffe made contact with Skywalker and his Padawan, Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Koon requested reinforcements for the impending assault on the Separatist ship, the Malevolence's battle droid crew jammed the Republic's transmissions, severing Koon and Wolffe's HoloNet connection to Skywalker and Tano.

With their deflector shields disabled from the blast, the unprotected Triumphant and the rest of the fleet fell under turbolaser fire from the Malevolence. Koon immediately ordered his crew to flee in escape pods, and Wolffe accompanied Koon, Clone Sergeant Sinker, and trooper Boost in one of the craft. The four jettisoned shortly before the Triumphant was ripped apart by the intense laser fire.

After Sinker and Boost were finally able to reactivate their pod's power, Wolffe picked up a signal from another life pod, Pod 1977. Wolffe soon spotted the pod, which was under attack from a Separatist Droch-class craft and several rocket battle droids. Unable to help the other pod, Koon and the troopers were forced to watch as the B1-Series battle droids split open the pod, submitting the craft's clone survivors to the airless vacuum of space.

Yet, the Separatists' damage to the pod caused Wolffe to lose the signal before he was able to return a message to Tano. Koon severed the Confederate vessel's pincers, breaking its hold on the pod, and then Force-pushed the craft away, causing it to hit some nearby debris and explode. Skywalker and Tano eventually found the escape pod floating amongst the debris field and pulled it into the rear cargo hold of Skywalker's freighter, the Twilight.

With the cargo hold's lights disabled, Wolffe deduced that the power had gone out and suspected that the Separatist ship had returned. Despite his weak condition, Wolffe attempted to get up to the bridge to find out what was wrong. Yet he nearly collapsed, and TB-2 caught him and went to check on the situation for the clones. Picking up the signal from the Twilight's still-active medical droid, the Malevolence fired its ion cannon at the freighter, but the Republic ship was able to avoid the ion wave by escaping the debris field and jumping to hyperspace.

However, the Separatists had already arrived on the planet and, under an alliance with native Khormai Warlord Unger Gout, had enslaved the majority of the planet's species and put them to work in an agrocite processing facility. After landing on Khorm during a storm, the Republic deployed its forces to attack the processing plant. En route to the facility with a squad of All Terrain Tactical Enforcers, Wolffe\u2014who had donned cold assault armor as protection from Khorm's icy climate\u2014conferred with Fisto on the subject of Koon, whose age had been of much recent debate in the clone commander's unit and whose curious manner had sparked the clone's curiosity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wolffe and Fisto met with Koon himself atop an AT-TE walker before rendezvousing with Adaroo and others of the Republic's Khormai allies.

On Koon's orders, the LAAT/i gunships of their extraction team fired upon the supports of the building, and the slave-processing facility tumbled into the depths of the crater. Koon and Wolffe later joined Skywalker, Tano, Rex, and Kenobi aboard the Star Destroyer to debrief the successful mission.

After establishing an outpost, Wolffe dispatched a squad of his troops to eliminate the remaining battle droids at the frigate's crash site, though intelligence was soon uncovered that the Death Watch had set up several training camps on Carlac. Upon learning of the Republic's arrival, the Death Watch leader, Pre Vizsla, took a native village hostage, threatening to raze the entire encampment to the ground if Wolffe and his men did not withdraw from Carlac immediately. Because his troops were already spread thin, Wolffe sent a Jedi Knight to destroy the training camps and free the village from Vizsla's grip.

Just as the meeting was about to start, the Separatists attempted to sabotage the conference by ramming the Valor station with the Star Destroyer Renown, which had been laden with Rhydonium ore explosives, but the intervention of Colonel Meebur Gascon's D-Squad saved Wolffe and his comrades, as the astromech R2-D2 detonated the explosives before the Renown crashed into the Valor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19.1 BBY, the final month of the war, Ahsoka Tano was framed for the murder of Letta Turmond, the orchestrator of a bombing at the Jedi Temple.

Believing that Tano was responsible for Turmond's murder, the Jedi High Council subsequently assigned Koon and Skywalker to track down the fugitive Padawan, with Wolffe and Captain Rex bringing along clone contingents from the Grand Army's Coruscant Guard and 501st Legion, respectively. Deploying on separate Republic police gunships, Koon's and Skywalker's search teams descended into the ventilation shaft portal to the underworld, first heading to Level 1312 to follow a lead from the lower-level police. Upon reaching Level 1313's terminal 24, Wolffe and his comrades spotted Tano absconding with Separatist agent\u2013turned\u2013bounty hunter Asajj Ventress. Tano and Ventress activated the terminal gate's ray shield, thwarting direct pursuit and leading Skywalker to dispatch a group of probe droids after the two fugitives.

A brawl ensued, with Ventress activating her lightsabers and cutting through the clone soldiers' blasters. Tano also joined the fight, making sure that she and her criminal accomplice did not harm the troopers beyond rendering them unconscious. Wolffe grappled with Ventress, grabbing her from behind and lifting her off her feet, but she broke free of his grasp before knocking him into a pillar.

To Skywalker's alarm, Wolffe's inspection of the crates revealed that they contained nano-droid explosives, of the same model that had been used to bomb the Jedi Temple. Wolffe and Rex brought the still-stunned Tano onto one of the police gunships with Koon and Skywalker, who reported to Masters Yoda and Mace Windu during the flight back to the Jedi Temple. With the evidence stacked against her, Tano was expelled from the Jedi Order and put to trial for her alleged part in the bombing of the Temple.

After being outfitted with sand-proof gear, Wolffe and his fellow 104th troopers proceeded to the moon's surface with a number of AT-TE walkers and HAVw A6 Juggernauts. While Comet and other troopers embarked into the rising sandstorm, Wolffe and Koon remained inside one of the Juggernauts, monitoring their troops' findings. Though Comet voiced skepticism after three failed scans that their purported ship was on the moon, Wolffe asserted that their information pinpointed it was nearby.

As a man of action, he was tireless in his efforts against the Separatists and took his cue from Jedi General Plo Koon's ferocity in battle, as did the rest of the Wolfpack. Serving with Koon throughout the war, Wolffe became acquainted with the Jedi Master, whose curious manner drew the clone's interest. Wolffe's manner was such that Koon came to place a great amount of trust in his instincts and abilities. He earned his men's trust to the point that they were willing to do anything under his leadership. Wolffe witnessed and endured some of the worst experiences that the war had to offer, particularly the loss of his entire Wolfpack command during the Battle of Abregado. He was frustrated when he was unable to assist his comrades Sinker and Boost in helping Koon confront the pod hunters, as he lacked the proper space-proof equipment due to his out-of-armor rotation. Even when injured, Wolffe retained his perception; when the lights in the Twilight's cargo hold went out, he deduced that the power had been shut down and was determined to reach the freighter's bridge in spite of his condition.

During the Battle of Khorm, Wolffe's dedication and loyalty to the Jedi often put him at odds with the ambitious Major Kendal Ozzel, who\u2014unlike Wolffe\u2014operated separately from the Jedi and disobeyed their orders to promote his own reputation. While under interrogation by Asajj Ventress, Wolffe told Ozzel not to reveal the Jedi's whereabouts; however, Ozzel betrayed the Jedi's mission to the enemy commander to protect his own life. Wolffe proved to be more focused than Ozzel, taking command and protecting Ozzel when the major himself panicked. Though Wolffe often scorned Ozzel and his frequent faltering, he followed the chain of command and obeyed the major's orders.

He disregarded the Aleena's eccentric customs, including their frequent ceremonial chants, and was eager to end his stay on Aleen as soon as possible. Strictly adhering to his orders, he could not understand King Manchucho's odd calls for peace with Aleena's underworld people and dismissed such entreaties as nonsense.
