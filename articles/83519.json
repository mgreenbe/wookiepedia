He inquired whether Elam's brother had left behind their family pet Hyperdrive to give Elam some company while reminding Elam to avoid the swoop gangs and keep practicing with the blaster.

Specifically, the password was composed of the following answers: Elam's pet was named Hyperdrive, it was Elam's uncle that provided Elam with blaster training, and Elam's homeworld was Alderaan. When the Republic soldier Revan and his companions visited Elam's apartment in the Lower City when Elam was not home, they referred to the message to unlock the crate and recover its contents for their own use."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Louie is only mentioned in the video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic as the sender of an electronic message to his relative Elam Mattic who also never actually appears in the game itself.
