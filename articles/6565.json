Skywalker's racer followed the basic design of other podracing machines, with two high-powered engines hauling a small cockpit behind them. The engines were linked by an energy binder and connected to the cockpit with control cables manufactured by Steelton. The vehicle was smaller and slimmer than other Podracers. The cockpit's total length was 3.15 meters and the engines were 7 meters in length. While the engines were originally waste items discarded by Watto, Skywalker developed a new type of fuel spraying device and a system that efficiently fed fuel to the fuel chamber which greatly improved the thrust. The Podracer reached a maximum speed of 947 kilometers per hour and was able to rise to an altitude of 105 meters with the help of repulsorlifts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In LEGO Star Wars: Droid Tales, this Podracer was given the non-canonical name Destiny's Favorite."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
