Though most of these clans resided far from other settlements or cities in the Doaba Badlands, a few clans resided near large spaceports such as Soco-Jarel and in a few rare cases Ibhaan'I clans had abandoned their nomadic lifestyle and lived within Vakeyya itself. It was not uncommon for Ibhaan'I clans to adopt smugglers, who came to regard the Ibhaan'I villages as their second home, or in some cases, their only home."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Most permanent Ibhaan'I structures were built with bricks composed of Socorro sand and druyza dung.
