The Republic governor ruled the planet from this city. It was a large hovering city-ship that floated above the oceans of Aquilaris. The city was built in response to the decay and loss of the Old City, which had fallen into disrepair and had slowly begun to descend to the depths of the Aquilaran oceans. The city was connected to nearby islands or cities by multiple bridges and underwater tunnels. The location of Floating City offered a unique and beautiful setting for some of the most scenic Podraces in the galaxy, including the Aquilaris Classic, Sunken City, and Bumpy's Breakers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
