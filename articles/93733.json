Within the cave, a mudhorn, a large horned creature, resided with its egg. Featuring striated walls, the cave's interior was cool, dark, and muddy, with bones strewn across the surface. Around 9 ABY, the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin was taken to the cave by a tribe of Jawas, so that he could retrieve the mudhorn's egg. Djarin entered the cave, and soon began fighting the mudhorn when it knocked him out of the cave. Djarin eventually killed the creature with the help of a Force-sensitive child and secured the egg, taking it to the Jawas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Appearance and conception"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mudhorn cave appeared in \"Chapter 2: The Child,\" the second episode of Jon Favreau's 2019 Disney+ live-action series The Mandalorian.
