In general, however, only beings who could use the Force engaged in lightsaber duels, as the dexterity and awareness required to wield such weapons necessitated extensive training in its mastery. Also of note, occasionally duels consisted of one or more of the combatants wielding weapons other than lightsabers, such as the duel between Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh. These contests were still worth notable mention however, since they involved prominent Force-using individuals who wielded weapons specifically designed to be used in conjunction with the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
