Over the centuries, the town grew until the fort and town became inseperable. Keremark was located between three ridges that formed a natural barrier against attack. During this time the fort's ancient walls were reinforced with modern materials, which made them stronger."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the years, the fort incorporated state-of-the-art defensive systems, no matter how slight the possibility of attack. In the last century, the fort has been a stronghold of the regional rulers, the Noelsse royal house. Who have maintained the fortress, using its defensive position for their lands. Conditions inside the fortress were military and restrictive, with guests required to check in and usually monitored while they are inside the fortress. Due to the threat of Imperial spies and infiltration from rival houses."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A walker barrier is the fort's outermost defensive position. Built of duralloy and permacrete, it combined a pit system with a high wall to stop Imperial AT-ATs and AT-STs. Advancing troops and speeders were hindered by a five meter high power fence that topped the wall. Access through the barrier was via two roads, both lined with traps. Surrounding the entire fortress was an eight-meter-high power fence, with sensor pods mounted on the fence posts. Deployed around the fortress were pit traps, collapsible sections of road and land, which were designed to hinder troops and trip walkers. High-grav traps that would immobilize men and small speeders were also deployed. Ancient stone turrets were reinforced with blaster-resistant metal alloy panels. Each turret was equipped with three double laser batteries and a mini-proton torpedo launcher."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
