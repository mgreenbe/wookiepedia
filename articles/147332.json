Despite his reputation, Darpen was recruited by Commander Wedge Antilles into the reformed Red Squadron after the Battle of Hoth, although Janson was not excited about his selection, saying he would become a spicerunner or a pirate within five years. Later, Janson expressed his certainty that Darpen was running a smuggling ring from his simulator, which Antilles recalled but declined to mention when meeting with The Contessa. He was assigned the callsign Red Seven and flew a T-65B X-wing starfighter as Antilles' wingman, alongside Sila Kott, in an attack on a nearby pirate base, that threatened the safety of the Alliance's rendezvous point."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
