Stims packs contained glowing blue green liquid. The liquid medical solution within the stim could be inhaled but often came in the form of small injectables, most were used to immediately treat a wide array of injuries, and could deliver a jolt to revive unconscious patients. The droid BD-1 was able to dispense healing stims, supplying the former Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis with them during his mission to rebuild the Jedi Order. After stunning Leia Organa and Han Solo to deceive SCAR Squadron on Hubin, Tula Markona had the butler droid MK-1 bring stim packs to revive them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
