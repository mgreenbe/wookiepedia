His slave, Anakin Skywalker, worked in the shop by repairing salvage for his owner. Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn sought to purchase a T-14 hyperdrive generator at Watto's shop after becoming stranded on the planet, but Watto refused to accept his Republic credit chips. Eventually, Jinn bet on Skywalker winning the Boonta Eve Classic podrace to get the hyperdrive generator, and for the boy's freedom."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
