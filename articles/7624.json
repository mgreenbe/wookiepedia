With the advent of the New Order, he did not fall victim to Order 66 or the Great Jedi Purge, and was instead taken to Byss with other captive Jedi-in-training.

Though he failed to capture or kill Lo'gaan, he was given other tasks, such as the discovery and conversion of fugitive Jedi on far-flung worlds. He was able to convert many to the cause of the Inquisitorius, and began honing his skills as an interrogator.

He was given command of the Interrogator, which he used to root out Rebel cells and pursue turncoat Dark Side Adepts.

After three years as Kylanu's Padawan, Tremayne was scolded for his vain nature and Kylanu taught him that truth was more relevant to the Jedi. Despite Kylanu's presence, Tremayne grew increasingly fascinated by the dark side of the Force\u2014an interest that caused concern amongst the rest of the Order.

When the new Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader arrived on Byss for an inspection tour, he was told by his master, Palpatine, to select worthy pupils to form a Jedi-hunting team, the Inquisitorius.

He also talked about progression in the New Order, and told the teenage audience that they would be exempted from the curfew restriction were they to join COMPNOR.

The Dark Lord then turned on his apprentice, demanding to know why he had kept the fugitive Jedi a secret. He throttled Tremayne, before viewing the Tagge/Palpatine holorecording.

Darys perished during the fight, and Tremayne suffered severe injuries at Lyn's hands. When Torbin stopped the fight by cleaving off Lyn's arm, Tremayne moved in for the kill, but the Grand Inquisitor decided that Palpatine may have a use for the ancient warrior.

Since his loss to Lo'gaan on the slave ship in years prior, Tremayne developed his lightsaber skills to a degree that he thought supreme. He became feared in the Outer Rim Territories, and grew a reputation for being a master torturer. However, Imperial Intelligence were generally adept at interrogation, so Tremayne spent most of his time searching for potential Dark Side Adepts. He found them in isolated communities, in the form of village shamans and dark side devotees. Tremayne also had no qualms about recruiting alien Force-sensitives to his cause.

One such candidate was Jerec, a Miralukan Jedi Master who had taken a sabbatical to the Unknown Regions during the Clone Wars, on a hunt for ancient Jedi artifacts. Tremayne found him there, and instead of killing the Jedi, extended an offer to him, claiming that if Jerec joined the Inquisitorius, he would surely survive through Palpatine's New Order. Jerec did not care enough for the Jedi ideals to adhere to them at the cost of his life, and willingly accepted Tremayne's offer. Another of Tremayne's discoveries that would rise to prominence in the New Order was the Firrerreo Hethrir, and his mate Rillao. Upon finding the pair, he tortured them, hoping to extract information as to the location of Jedi fugitives. However, they were not Jedi, and had no affiliation with them whatsoever. Believing that the pair would make for suitable Dark Side Adepts, Tremayne took them to his master for training.

Before he could get to Shelvay, he murdered the Jedi's parents, and took his sister, Elena, forcing her to join COMPNOR. When he was finally captured, Corwin Shelvay went through full COMPNOR and Intelligence interrogations, before being transferred to the Inquisitor. By this time, Tremayne had been able to break every prisoner he had captured, but Shelvay proved to be the exception, resisting violent and brutal torture for two weeks. Before Tremayne had the opportunity to interrogate Shelvay further, the Jedi's master, Darrin Arkanian, saved Shelvay and escaped, planning to find passage off Imperial Center with Captain Rashh."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Tremayne learned of Shelvay's escape, he gathered a squad of troops, and set off after the fugitives. Luckily for Tremayne, his torturing methods had damaged Shelvay to such a stage where his master had to carry him through the city, impeding their progress greatly. Tremayne caught up with them in a courtyard just near their point of departure, and revealed himself. Arkanian strode forward boldly to meet Tremayne, but Shelvay grew weak at the Inquisitor's presence, and his legs buckled underneath him. Tremayne took the opportunity, and lashed out at Arkanian with his green lightsaber.

Tremayne gloated over the corpse of Arkanian, as it was the first Jedi Master he had ever killed. Shelvay's reaction, however, was significantly more violent. The young Padawan, touching the dark side of the Force, took up his master's blade and engaged Tremayne with a vengeance. The High Inquisitor found himself hard pressed to defend himself, and did not anticipate Shelvay's unorthodox attack.

His only consolation being the death of Arkanian, Tremayne vowed to find Shelvay and break him. For the time being, however, he was content in the knowledge that his dark side knowledge would have increased by the next time they met. He would also use the cumbersome cybernetics to his advantage, as they instilled fear in onlookers.

Following the Battle of Yavin, Tremayne was given command of the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Interrogator. He also gained the life debt of the Srrors'tok Ahnjai Rahmma, who served the High Inquisitor as a bodyguard. Rahmma detested Tremayne and the Empire, but his people's culture dictated that he must fulfill the life debt until either his or Tremayne's death. Tremayne, in turn, treated Rahmma poorly, mocking him in front of colleagues, and dispatching him on dangerous assassination work.

Vharing took Nolaan's place as captain, but during an expedition through the stretch of space known as the Nharqis'I, an error in judgment occurred.

He allied with Hethrir, but kept his involvement with the organization a secret. In 12 ABY, he revealed the existence of the Valley of the Jedi to the Procurator.

Tremayne's vanity would be his downfall when fighting Shelvay on Imperial Center, since he was confident that he could easily anticipate the Padawan's dueling moves.

Dark Vendetta claims that Palpatine had ascended to the position of Emperor while the Jedi Order was still active, and that \"Darth Vader\" was also in existence at this time. Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, however, shows that the destruction of the Jedi Order was simultaneous with Palpatine's ascension. These would be reconciled by Paul Ens, who would use Tremayne in his 2005-2006 webstrip series, Evasive Action, as the primary antagonist. Ens also gave the character the first name of \"Antinnis.\" Despite the reconciliations, several statements in Dark Vendetta still clash with Evasive Action: Recruitment.
