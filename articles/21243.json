Bulbas' bones were very weak, which set the stage for a symbiotic relationship with an indigenous vine species. Bulba mothers made nests out of dying vines, and the seeds on the vines' flowers planted themselves into the thin skin of the babies, taking root inside their bodies. The roots then wrapped their way around the infant bulbas' bones, giving them the strength they lacked. When a bulba died, new vines grew from its body, and bulba mothers built nests from their flowers, which gave rise to a new generation of both species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
