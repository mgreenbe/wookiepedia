The first starship to qualify as a battlecruiser under the Anaxes War College System, the Procurator-class was heavily-armed and featured a ventral protrusion to accommodate its powerful reactor. The Procurator-class was refined over the years before it was succeeded by the four thousand-meter-long Praetor-class Star Battlecruiser and the eight thousand meter-long Mandator-class Star Dreadnaught. Procurator-class Star Battlecruisers were primarily used to defend the Kuat sector, though they also served to attract wealthy clients to KDY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
