Tiree followed Vander's order to transfer all power to his Y-wing's front deflector screen as a defense against the space station's turbolaser turrets, which Tiree described as \"a little aggressive\". Locking his targeting computer and receiving a signal for the coming attack on the Death Star's thermal exhaust port, Tiree observed that the turbolasers had suddenly ceased firing, as three enemy fighters, lead by Darth Vader, entered the trench. Tiree was quickly shot down and killed when Darth Vader's TIE Advanced x1 struck his Y-wings's engines, causing an electrical explosion in the cockpit before his fighter was engulfed in flame. Remembered by Princess Leia Organa as a good man, Tiree was joined shortly by his wingmates."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tiree was played by Jeremy Sinden in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Gold Five identifies his wingmate as Tiree in A New Hope, it is unclear whether the name refers to Gold Two or Gold Leader.
