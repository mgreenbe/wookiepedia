It was tall and thin, with long limbs. They were built for light to moderate duty in offices or light industrial facilities. They specialized in accounting and analytical skills, and were highly valued by banking and financial firms.

The Uhr-Vah-Vo company was bought out by the InterGalactic Banking Clan who were very impressed with the droid. The IGBC used the 88s in all their facilities, but then they were replaced and sold at a deep discount to banks and other companies outside the Clan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The true reason behind this move revealed itself when the Clone Wars ended. All the droids shut down and it was discovered they were being used for espionage purposes.
