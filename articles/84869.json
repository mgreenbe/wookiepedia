It was designed before the standards of speeder bike style had become common, and therefore looked very different from most speeder bikes. It had a large, sleek tail section that housed the repulsorlifts and turbothrust engines. It also had a storage bay in the tail. The long tail helped with stability. Military versions came with a small blaster mounted on the nose."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This speeder bike was manufactured by Incom Corporation while its hydrodynamic adaptor kits were developed by the Xi Char for the Trade Federation, to compensate design flaws in the Manta droid subfighter. An aquatic variant of the vehicle saw action during the Battle of Mon Calamari."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The MVR-3's design, including the extended tail and curve up bow were remarkably similar to the Razalon FC-20 speeder bike, made famous by Darth Maul, and the Flitknot speeder manufactured by Huppla Pasa Tisc Shipwrights Collective."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
