Imperial Governor Wilek Nereus once captured a bloodwolf as part of his collection of dental specimens. Mountain ranges above the Renan vineyards were home to this species, which stood just under a meter tall at its shoulder. Its two pair of slashing teeth were abnormally large compared to its skull. These creatures had long fur, mottled in broad patches for camouflage. Mature bloodwolves' tooth enamel was a dusky red-brown caused by iron deposits in the outer layer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sourcebook"}]}
