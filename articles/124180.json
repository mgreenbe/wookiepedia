A loose affiliation of planets and conglomerates who wished to leave the Republic had formed the Confederacy of Independent Systems\u2014or CIS for short\u2014under the guidance of the former Jedi Master Dooku. In the third month of the year, the Sluissi Senator Corlissi Ludar announced the secession of his sector from the Republic. In reaction, Paige-Tarkin was quick to assert Seswenna's loyalty to the government. In her statements, she made clear her contempt for the lawlessness of other Outer Rim worlds that had joined the CIS. She even added that her people would not hesitate to take arms if Seswenna's worlds became the front line in a hypothetical war. Paige-Tarkin's strong words were published in CoCo District's edition of the HoloNet News."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two months later, the Clone Wars erupted, with the brand new Grand Army of the Republic and the Jedi Order fighting the Separatists. As an unabashed follower of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, leader of the Republic, Senator Paige-Takin sided with the Loyalists during the conflict. Totally unaware of the Chancellor's Sith alter ego as Darth Sidious, she considered him a savior of the Republic and a role model. As the war dragged on, Paige-Tarkin became worried about Palpatine's health. She was delighted when the Chancellor called upon her, along with Senator Jannie Ha'Nook from Glithnos and others, to support him during the conflict on Praesitlyn, a world close to the border of the Seswenna sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later during the Clone Wars, Dooku offered a generous live bounty on each Republican senator captured, and Paige-Tarkin was nearly caught in the nets of T'doshok, a Trandoshan bounty hunter who tried to abduct her on Coruscant.
