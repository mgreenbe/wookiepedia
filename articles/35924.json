The future of the galaxy was strongly affected by this decision."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tyranus managed to arrive at the Works of Coruscant and he delivered the schematics personally to Darth Sidious. Once the Clone Wars were over, Palpatine shaped this idea for his own purposes. Blueprints were used as a basis for construction of the station, and, after the Death Star's completion, the plans became a prime target for the Rebellion, whose members hoped to find and exploit a weakness in the superweapon. In large part because of this, the Empire split up the plans and sent it to various places of the galaxy to prevent enemy hands from acquiring it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Rebel Alliance acquires the plans"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "First encounter"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The top-secret Imperial weapons project headed by Wilhuff Tarkin was hinted at by several high officials, including Tarkin himself, but its true nature remained unknown for some time. The first vital piece of information about the Death Star was obtained during the mission to Darkknell, which took place sometime before the signing of the Corellian Treaty in 2 BBY, during which Darth Vader captured the Rebel Leaders Bail Prestor Organa, Mon Mothma and Garm Bel Iblis and sent them to the unfinished Death Star I for execution. There Emperor Palpatine revealed them the name and the purpose of the battle station before executing them, but the Rebel leaders were saved by Galen Marek, who sacrificed himself to allow them escape. As the construction of the Death Star drew closer to completion, Mon Mothma and Bail Organa knew that Rebels needed to obtain a complete technical readout of the Death Star. If their engineers could pinpoint a weakness in the battlestation, then the Rebels might be able to destroy it. The Alliance set into motion the biggest anti-Imperial offensive it had ever attempted: a complex, coordinated operation to compile a complete set of plans for the Death Star and transmit it to the Tantive IV. Various missions were undertaken by the Rebel Alliance with this purpose, but while some of them succeeded, others simply confirmed the Death Star's existence, name and purpose, which were in fact already known to the Leader of the Alliance."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Events on Vergesso and Raltiir"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the raid on Vergesso facilities Captain Raymus Antilles secured the assistance of Han Solo's smuggling skills.

The EMP successfully disabled the station's defenses long enough for Rebel search teams to raid the station. The data they acquired \"confirmed\" the existence of the Death Star I and gave the Rebels an idea of the scale of its destructive capabilities, but failed to provide any technical information with which a weakness could be identified. Even Gial Ackbar, Tarkin's personal slave rescued during the raid, knew little about the plot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using funds stolen from the raid on Ylesia and other sources, the Rebellion planted and aided spies on the world of Ralltiir. One of their number, Basso, also \"confirmed\" the existence of a massive Imperial construction, code-named Death Star. This was later identified as a massive superlaser-wielding battlestation by the Empire's Lord Tion. Shortly before his death, Tion revealed that a convoy containing the Death Star plans was en route to Toprawa from Tarkin's headquarters on Eriadu."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Death Star uprising"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A section of the plans were stolen from the Empire during a Rebel jail break inside the nearly completed Death Star.

The problem was that while Danuta plans included additional engineering schematics and a complete map to the offensive and defensive weapons emplacements, the plans for the superlaser control systems and battle station's hull design and life support infrastructure were not included in these plans, but were held within the Imperial Research Facility on Toprawa itself. Additionally, the Alliance already held the intercepted technical data from AX-235 with the plans from the actual Death Star. All of this information was needed to ensure success. The Rebels on Toprawa had a shot at the convoy, while Mon Mothma recruited an Imperial defector named Kyle Katarn and the mercenary Rianna Saren to infiltrate an Imperial outpost on Danuta."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kyle was to steal a memory matrix there that contained the plans for the Death Star while Rianna was charged with retrieving more Intel from Zarien Kheev. With the aid of Jan Ors and Meck Odom, Katarn escaped the facility and transmitted this set of the plans to Rebel spies in the Toprawa system, where it was eventually passed to Princess Leia on the Tantive IV.

They managed to take the communications center station, where Havet Storm arrived with the superlaser plans. Here they were ambushed by head of security Commander Diamond and her stormtroopers. While Red Hand Squadron held off Imperial forces outside the Center, Havet transmitted the plans in a quick burst, using frequency 1215.

Once there, the 501st was caught up in a firefight with the Rebellion. By the time the 501st got to the plans, a copy had already been beamed from Polis Massa to the Tantive IV. The Signal branch of Imperial Intelligence's Analysis Bureau discovered that the plans had been sent to the Tantive IV by analyzing the unshielded ELEL (Extremely Low Energy Level) transmission from droid U-3PO aboard the ship. This allowed Vader to track the Tantive IV to Tatooine."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Moff Kalast and the Bothan Spynet"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime prior to the Death Star plans arriving on Polis Massa, rogue Imperial Moff Kalast aided the Rebellion with information linked to the battlestation.

The Emperor, along with two of his Royal Guards, slaughtered a large number of Bothans. One Bothan, begging for his life, informed the Emperor that the plans were to be beamed to the Tantive IV in the Tatoo system.

They attempted to deliver this readout to the Star Cruiser Liberty, but a sudden appearance of the Star Destroyer Devastator caused the transfer to stop; Tantive IV moved to Tatooine to reach Obi-Wan Kenobi so that he could bring it to Bail Organa on Alderaan. Before they could succeed, though, Darth Vader led a strike against the ship by the 501st Legion. Princess Leia, knowing the Rebels had no hope of defeating Vader's forces, placed the plans within the astromech droid R2-D2, programmed him to deliver them with a message to Obi-Wan Kenobi on Tatooine, and then, after being captured by Vader, denied that Tantive IV had ever received such plans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "R2-D2 boarded an escape pod with C-3PO and journeyed through the sands of Tatooine to fulfill his mission. The plans were nearly in danger of being lost forever when Jawas ambushed and enslaved R2, but a string of events led R2 to the ownership of Owen Lars. R2 convinced Lars's nephew Luke Skywalker to remove the droid's restraining bolt, suggesting that doing so was the only way R2 could access the rest of Princess Leia's message (which Luke had accidentally discovered), but it was not long after Luke had done so that R2 had taken the opportunity to escape, seeking out General Kenobi. Luke and C-3PO chased R2 down, after which they stumbled across a group of Sand People. Again the plans were nearly doomed, but the Sand People scattered at the arrival of one they knew and feared: Obi-Wan Kenobi. R2-D2 had completed his task."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The trail to Yavin"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leia's message conveyed to Obi-Wan the urgency of bringing R2 to Bail Organa.

In a demonstration of the Death Star's capabilities, Grand Moff Tarkin had ordered the planet destroyed, and the crew of the Falcon exited hyperspace only to find their destination missing, while a lone TIE/LN starfighter fled the scene. Han determined to destroy the fighter so that their location could not be reported, but following the fighter led the Falcon to the Death Star itself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "R2 was as close to the Imperials as he could be, and at one point he and C-3PO were even forced to interact with a squad of stormtroopers. Still, none of the soldiers realized that the little droid the Empire had been searching for was on the very station it posed so dangerous a threat to. When the crew of the Falcon escaped with Princess Leia and headed to Yavin 4, R2 and the precious plans he carried were with them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having arrived on Yavin 4, the Death Star plans were studied by General Jan Dodonna and other Rebel officers in the hope of finding an exploitable weakness. In addition, because of the Death Star's unexpected arrival shortly thereafter thanks to a tracking droid smuggled on the Falcon, the personnel also rushed through trying to strategise on how to destroy the Death Star via the plans. They found it in the form of a small thermal exhaust port which, if hit directly by a proton torpedo, would trigger a chain reaction destroying the battle station. This is precisely what Luke Skywalker did in the proceeding Battle of Yavin."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Hutt threat"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the fall of the Empire, the Death Star Plans were kept by the New Republic in a secure computer system on Coruscant. However, in 12 ABY, a team of Taurill commandos broke in during a diplomatic reception for Durga the Hutt and stole a copy of the plans. They delivered them to Durga, who had Bevel Lemelisk use the captured designs to create a new version of the Death Star, the Darksaber.

However, the old design can still be seen in the grid plan animations in the movie. This is because the animation was created before the prop designers decided to make the change. The original plans displayed in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, set twenty years earlier, show the final form."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The grid plan animations shown during the Rebel briefing for the attack on the Death Star late in A New Hope were an actual computer graphics simulation from the Jet Propulsion Labs (JPL) made by Larry Cuba and Gary Imhoff as part of a project for school at CalArts, and had been included during filming for Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope (then known as just Star Wars). Originally, the writers and staff planned to thank JPL for assisting in the graphics, but it was changed to the specific programmers' names after one of the programmers, Mike Plesset, pointed out that JPL didn't even know their computers had been used."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The exact order of events and the way the multiple plans were combined by the Rebels are not clearly understood. One major reason for this is that, like fighting in the Battle of Hoth, stealing or protecting the Death Star plans has become a playable feature in Star Wars video games such as Star Wars: X-Wing, Star Wars: Dark Forces, Star Wars: Battlefront II, Star Wars: Empire at War, and Star Wars: Lethal Alliance. For example, in Lethal Alliance, Rianna Saren escapes Despayre soon before its destruction, transmitting her part of the plans to Princess Leia at the end of the game, yet as revealed in the novel Death Star, Despayre was destroyed during the events of A New Hope, after Leia was captured. These games don't always maintain continuity, and a future retcon may combine all sources into one cohesive storyline. Such an attempt was made with the Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire graphic novel, which reconciled the Toprawa and Danuta plans, while The Lost Jedi Adventure Game Book and Rebel Dawn incorporated the Toprawa story from the get-go."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Star Wars original Databank article on the Death Star acknowledged the contributions of Kyle Katarn, Keyan Farlander, \"Rebel spies in the Toprawa system,\" and other unnamed heroes.
