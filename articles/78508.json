He came to the out-of-the-way planet of Arvala-7 seeking peace, and worked as a vapor farmer who offered valuable skills to those who could meet his price. Eventually, criminals and mercenaries trespassed on his world during the time of the New Republic, and at some point Kuiil encountered the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin.

There, a discussion of Djarin's job took place, with Kuiil confiding to Djarin that many bounty hunters had come searching for the same asset as he had, disturbing the peace on the solitary planet. After some talk, Kuiil decided to teach Djarin how to ride a blurrg so they could reach the Nikto mercenary encampment where his target was being held. As Djarin struggled, Kuiil motivated the bounty hunter by telling him of his ancestors that had rode the great mythosaur. Afterwards, the two ventured out to the encampment. Kuiil left Djarin and wished him luck, heading back to the farm."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Negotiating with Jawas"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, Djarin returned to Kuiil's farm after successfully retrieving his bounty and explained that his ship, the Razor Crest, had been salvaged and looted by local Jawas, leaving him stranded. Kuiil was surprised to see Djarin alive and that Grogu was what all the bounty hunter trouble had been about. Kuiil agreed to assist Djarin in recovering the stolen parts of his ship and suggested that Djarin try trading with the Jawas instead of fighting them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next morning, Kuiil took Djarin and Grogu to the Jawas' sandcrawler. At first, the Jawas were afraid of the Mandalorian, as he had killed several of them the day before in his first attempt to retrieve his parts, but Kuiil eventually convinced Djarin to drop his weapons and try to negotiate peacefully. The Jawas agreed to trade the Razor Crest's salvaged parts in exchange for Djarin's beskar armor or for Grogu, both of which he aggressively refused. When Djarin started threatening the Jawas with his flamethrower after he tried to communicate in the Jawas' language and they laughed and said he sounded like a Wookiee, Kuiil took over with the negotiations. Eventually, the Jawas agreed to give Djarin his stolen parts back if he obtained a mudhorn egg for them, to which Djarin agreed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kuiil, Djarin, and Grogu rode inside the Jawas' sandcrawler towards the nest of the mudhorn. When they arrived, Djarin took his weapons and Grogu and headed off in search of the mudhorn. A while later, the Jawas grew impatient and started to drive off despite Kuiil's protests. Just at that moment, however, Djarin returned with the egg; his armor badly damaged and covered in mud. Kuiil was pleased to see that his friends survived and commented that he was surprised it took Djarin so long, to which Djarin said he was surprised that Kuiil waited for him. Kuiil helped Djarin load his parts onto the hoversled and rode back to the moisture farm with him. On the journey, Kuiil asked if Grogu was injured, to which Djarin said that he didn't think he was physically injured and explained how he had helped him kill the mudhorn. Kuiil said that he still didn't understand what happened and Djarin admitted that he didn't either."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Repairing the Razor Crest"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When they eventually arrived at the remains of the Razor Crest, Djarin commented that it would take him days to fix the ship without a proper maintenance facility. Kuiil helped Djarin repair the ship, saying there was much work to do. Working together, they managed to repair and restore the ship's systems and parts. Later, Djarin told Kuiil that he could not thank him enough for his assistance and offered to share part of the bounty's reward with him as well as inviting Kuiil aboard as a crew member, stating that he could use someone of his ability and offered to pay him handsomely. Kuiil said that he would be honored but that he had spent a lifetime working to be free of servitude, declining both offers. Djarin said he understood and offered Kuiil his thanks. Kuiil thanked Djarin for bringing peace to his valley before mounting his blurrg.

Finding IG-11's remains, Kuiil brought them back to his farm, where he rebuilt and reprogrammed the droid, despite little remaining of the neural harness, and staked it as his own in accordance with the Charter of the New Republic. Kuiil patiently trained it to perform domestic and manual tasks around the farm such as cooking, cleaning, and feeding the blurrgs.

Djarin explained that he returned to Arvala-7 to enlist Kuiil's services in watching over Grogu while they join up with Greef Karga on Nevarro and attempt to take out the Client, however Kuiil said that he is unwilling to put himself into another being's services since he freed himself from his indentured service. However, the Mandalorian still wanted to hire him, so Kuiil offered to reprogram IG-11 to serve as a nanny for Grogu. Djarin expressed his distrust of droids, but eventually allowed the droid to join them in their mission. Kuiil refused to accept any payment for his services, telling Djarin that he was doing it to protect Grogu from Imperial slavery. When Kuiil also insisted that Djarin allow him to take his blurrgs along, the bounty hunter obliged and penned the beasts inside the cargo hold of the Razor Crest."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Voyage to Nevarro"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the journey, Djarin and Dune engaged in a game of arm wrestling. Grogu, believing that the Mandalorian was in danger, Force choked Dune until Djarin told him that she is a friend.

Dune questioned how Kuiil walked free of Imperial indentured servitude, to which he said that he bought his freedom with the skills of his hands and the labor of three human lifetimes; telling her not to doubt him. Later, Djarin asked for Kuiil's help in padding Grogu's pram. Kuiil accepted and said that it was a way to prove how he freed himself from servitude through his craftsmanship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Razor Crest landed in a remote part of Nevarro, where they were met by Karga and four other bounty hunters. Karga explained that he had arranged for a rendezvous in a remote location because the town was now run by ex-Imperial forces. Karga suggested that Dune stay behind to guard the ship from Jawas, however Djarin insisted that Dune would join them and IG-11 stayed behind instead.

Suddenly, several native reptavians descended on the group.

When they arrived, Karga and his two remaining men attempted to ambush Djarin and Dune, however Karga had a change of heart and shot his men dead. Karga explained that their initial plan had been to kill them and take Grogu but he couldn't go through with it after the infant saved his life. Karga tried to convince Djarin and Dune not to kill him by explaining that Grogu won't be safe with him dead, but they didn't listen to him until Kuiil convinced them to hear Karga out. The four agreed to send Dune and Karga in with Djarin pretending to be their prisoner along with Grogu's empty pram as a decoy to allow them to get close to the Client and kill him. Djarin told Kuiil to take Grogu back to the Razor Crest on the surviving blurrg and to activate the ground security protocols once he got there.
