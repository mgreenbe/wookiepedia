His team knew the T-65 X-wing starfighters, BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bombers and UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support crafts that they maintained as well as the rebel pilots that flew them, and Stewer made sure there was a symbiotic relationship between the pilots and ground crew in the base. The chief would often implore the pilots with exhausted futility to not damage \"his\" starfighters; however, these complaints masked a good humor shared between Stewer and his crew and the pilots. In the year 0 BBY, he was present in the base's hangar when the criminal Jyn Erso was brought in to take part in Operation Fracture. Stewer had brown hair and eyes and fair skin. While in the base he wore a synthetic fabric boilersuit and a variant of the standard Alliance service helmet with a comlink but no visor. He later sired a son, named Garn Stewer, Jr. who served as an A-wing pilot for the Resistance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Garn Stewer first appeared in the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which was released in North America on December 16, 2016.
