City Hall was located in the center of the city, which was situated atop one of Makeb's seven-kilometer-high stone mesas, and Tarlam Estates Marketplace dominated the southern half of the city. Tarlam Central Square was located east of City Hall, and the northern district of the city was known as the Tarlam Oasis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 3638 BBY, the Hutt Toborro unleashed one of his new Isotope-5 droids on the city in order to convince Shalim Avesta to return control of the Ark. The city was also overrun by the forces of the Hutt Cartel and InterStellar Regulators. By that time, Tarlam was run by Mayor Erkens, who was supported by Councilor Soler and other officials, though the mesa was in danger of collapsing because of the Hutt's deep-mining of Makeb's core. Tarlam had four shuttle pads; one in the southeast, one in the northwest, one in the Oasis, and one near the mayor's residence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
