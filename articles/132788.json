On a routine X-wing patrol flight, Luke and his squadron came across a derelict Imperial Star Destroyer with all its personnel dead and turned crimson-skinned. Luke and the other pilots caught the unknown virus as well and were promptly quarantined after returning to base.

Chewbacca hesitates at first, but eventually relates (with C-3PO translating) how he and Han were shanghaied aboard a pirate ship and transported to the Red Nebula. With a crew of pirates and mercenaries, Han pilots the ship safely through the asteroid field that separates the Red Nebula from the rest of the galaxy. Upon landing on a planet orbiting a single sun, Han, Chewbacca, and several mercenaries descend on a temple to remove two red jewels with worth beyond calculating, according to the ship's captain as well as an exile named Klysk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arrival at the temple, three of the mercenaries encounter the priest and the temple's twelve-foot-tall shaggy guardian. In this distraction, Han reaches for the jewels himself, but the guardian reaches for Chewbacca instead, perceiving a childlike version of herself in the Wookiee. Han returns to Klysk with the jewels, but Klysk takes them and strands Solo on the planet, dooming it in the priest's belief to their destruction by the Red Nebula. The jewels were believed to protect the planet from cosmic forces, and after Klysk pilots his ship into the sun, the priest believes them doomed. Solo then confesses that he replaced the jewels with rocks before he gave them to Klysk; however, one of Klysk's crew tried to make off with a single jewel, and he's found dead with crimson skin\u2014the first known sighting of what the Alliance came to call the Crimson Forever.

The other jewel is on board the ship, but the whole area has been quarantined because the longer both jewels remain separate, the more organic lifeforms are affected by them.

In the last panel, Lando says he told the bounty hunters that Domina Tagge is wanted by the Empire for the destruction of a crew on one of their ships-of-the-line, and suggested that the Empire might offer a substantial reward for her. \"They seemed quite interested.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Development"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In celebration of Marvel Comics' 80th anniversary, a reprint of Star Wars 50 was published on May 1, 2019."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Story elements of Star Wars 50 were continued in Star Wars 108, which was published on May 29, 2019."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Editions"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
