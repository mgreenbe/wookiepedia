Lando, L3 and Kristiss traveled through the wastelands of the planet to get to the outpost. Lando was captured by Batalla and his outlaws of the wastelands, while Kristiss and L3 were captured by the Empire. Kristiss was forced to work at the outpost with the other Pestrusians while L3 escaped Imperial custody. Lando tried to escape from Batalla but was recaptured and forced to fight in a arena. L3 returned to the Millennium Falcon and freed Lando. Lando headed back to the outpost where he rallied the enslaved Pestrusians to the cause. They used melee weapons to break out of the outpost and L3 gave them blasters to fight back. Kristiss programmed the repaired droids to also rise up against the Empire.
