For example, interior doors could be made of plasteel. The red Kaleesh mask worn by Sidon Ithano was also made of plasteel, as were certain parts of Darth Vader's helmet. The Knight of Ren Cardo wore plasteel-armored greaves. Plasteel was also used for treads, such as the 125-Z treadspeeder bike. The material could also be used in reconstructive surgery; by placing a plasteel sleeve over a fused bone segment, a surgeon would lend it enough strength so it was as sturdy as the original bone. Similarly, a plasteel mask could be attached over newly reshaped facial muscles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The young rebel Ezra Bridger sometimes referred to Imperial stormtroopers as \"plasteel pigs,\" although their distinctive white armors were actually made of plastoid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since plasteel appears in most pieces of Star Wars media, this list only includes specific mentions or descriptions of plasteel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
