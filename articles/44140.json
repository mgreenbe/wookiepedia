During the coup which brought the Krath into power, a loyalist of the old dynasty stole the artifacts and hid them in the system. Only a few of the Jewels were recovered by the Krath, but over the ensuing millennia, most of them had been discovered. As of 11 ABY, the Crown Jewels were considered a Wonder of the Galaxy, and the only major missing pieces were Teta's knives. The Tetan Royal Family offered a reward of 1 million credits to anyone who could return the knives to them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
