After Tarnis's attempt to use the Republic superweapon known as the Planet Prison against the Republic's capital planet of Coruscant failed, his father put Tarnis's final gift\u2014information on the rest of the Republic superweapon initiative\u2014to use and dispatched his three Sith apprentices, Lords Praven, Sadic, and Nefarid, to take control of the Republic's weapons facilities on Tatooine, Nar Shaddaa, and Alderaan.

However, the Knight and Galen were able to defeat Sadic and destroy the Power Guard project, preventing Angral's apprentice from creating an army of mind-controlled supersoldiers from the refugees on the moon. The Sith Emperor himself intervened in the conflict in an attempt to recover Carsen; the Sith ruler sent Valis\u2014a Child of the Emperor, an extension of the Emperor's own will\u2014to lure out and capture Carsen, but the Knight and the former Child defeated the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Angral's other apprentices were also successful in capturing their assigned weapons projects, with Praven defeating the Jedi Master Bela Kiwiiks who was sent to guard the Shock Drum on Tatooine and Nefarid trapping Master Orgus Din in a ruined laboratory after stealing the Death Mark laser. However, Praven was disgusted by his own Master's dishonorable actions and was convinced to abandon the Sith by the Knight, and the Jedi was able to rescue Kiwiiks from near-death and destroy the Shock Drum before it tore Tatooine apart. The mission to Alderaan was hampered by the interference of an Imperial spy named Aleyna Hark, but the Knight and crew managed to prevent the assassination of the Alderaanian noble Horis Thul\u2014an action that also saved the budding peace negotiations that were working towards ending Alderaan's brutal civil war.

The attack, which devastated Uphrades's surface and killed millions, was also intended to draw out Tarnis's killer, and Angral set up a confrontation by attacking the Jedi Order's homeworld of Tython. While the Desolator recharged, the Knight and Carsen boarded the Oppressor and disabled the superweapon before confronting Angral on the bridge of his warship. The resultant battle saw the death of Darth Angral and the destruction of the Oppressor, signalling the end of the Desolator weapon and the current crisis, but Angral's war was one of several factors that led to the dissolution of the Treaty of Coruscant and the resumption of war in the months that followed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The crisis involving the Desolator superweapon centered around two powerful Force-users and their apprentices: Jedi Master Orgus Din and the Sith Lord Darth Angral. The two humans were bound by a rivalry that stretched back to the last days of the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, where the pair fought before the Senate Building during the Sacking of Coruscant in 3653 BBY. When the Treaty of Coruscant ended the twenty-eight-year conflict and forced the galaxy into a tense Cold War, Angral was furious at the lost advantage over the Republic, and his anger only grew over the next decade. Orgus Din and the Jedi Order, meanwhile, retreated to their recently rediscovered homeworld of Tython in the Deep Core and began to slowly rebuild their strength."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over the next ten years, Angral trained two further apprentices, Nefarid and Sadic, to the status of Sith Lord, while his former student Praven trained Angral's own son Tarnis in the ways of the dark side.

Morr and his forces were defeated, however, with the help of Din's new apprentice, whom the Jedi Master met after witnessing the learner defeat Morr's own apprentice Callef with only a vibrosword. Feeling that the Force had drawn them together, Din decided to take on the young Jedi as his Padawan, and the two investigated the recent activity on Tython. After the apprentice rescued Din from Morr and defeated the Dark Jedi in a duel, the Padawan was granted the rank of Jedi Knight and sent to the Republic capital of Coruscant to aid Jedi Master Bela Kiwiiks and her Padawan Kira Carsen investigate a dark presence that the Jedi High Council had sensed there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That dark presence, which Kiwiiks was able to confirm upon her arrival on Coruscant during the war with the Flesh Raiders, was actually Angral's son Tarnis, deep undercover as a Republic scientist named Eli Tarnis. Under this alias, Tarnis had joined the Republic superweapon initiative, the Republic's weapons division, several years earlier and quickly became the head of the development team for the Planet Prison superweapon. The Planet Prison, a device that ionized a planet's atmosphere in order to blockade enemy worlds without excessive naval force, was one of several weapons projects started by the Mon Calamari general Var Suthra in the aftermath of the Sacking of Coruscant. Suthra, who had witnessed the destruction of the Jedi Temple, founded the projects in honor of the Jedi who had fallen during the defense of their home as a way to end the next war with minimal loss of life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The crisis"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early battles"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Planet Prison"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Planet Prison prototype became ready for field tests in 3643 BBY, but Tarnis felt that his position was threatened when Kiwiiks detected traces of his presence in the Force. Worried that further investigation would reveal his true identity, Tarnis contacted the Black Sun criminal syndicate and introduced himself as a Sith Lord. In exchange for advanced Imperial weapons and armor, Black Sun agreed to aid Tarnis in his plans to escape Coruscant. A Rodian thief named Vistis Garn who often worked for Black Sun's rival, the Migrant Merchants' Guild, was hired to use the Guild to steal the design files for the Planet Prison, and he raided a warehouse belonging to the Republic Military with a team of Guild personnel. While stealing a large number of weapons and munitions for the Guild, Garn employed the team's slicer to hack into the warehouse's computer systems and steal the design files for the Planet Prison and the Republic's other superweapon projects."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Garn's face was glimpsed by a security camera, and the Republic Strategic Information Service\u2014the Republic's intelligence agency\u2014was able to identify the Rodian from the security footage almost thirty-two hours later. Around that time, Orgus Din's former apprentice arrived on Coruscant and reported to Conference Room 2-Aurek in the Senate Building, where Masters Kiwiiks and Din were discussing the stolen Planet Prison files with General Suthra, Doctor Tarnis, and Kiwiiks's Padawan Carsen. Not long after the recently-Knighted Jedi arrived at the Senate Building with the astromech droid T7-O1, also known as Teeseven, the SIS Agent Galen\u2014the head of the SIS branch located in the Senate Building\u2014interrupted the meeting to report the break in the case. General Suthra and the Jedi Masters departed for a meeting with Supreme Chancellor Dorian Janarus, leaving Galen to work with the Knight, Carsen, and Teeseven on retrieving the files."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Galen's subordinates were able to track Garn's team to a warehouse in the Guild-controlled Old Galactic Market region, and Galen dispatched the Knight and Teeseven to retrieve the stolen files and weapons. Making their way to the warehouse, the pair raided the warehouse, but by that time Garn had used the Guild's slicer to decrypt the files and send a copy to Black Sun. At the same time, Tarnis contacted Salarr, the leader of Black Sun, and set the next stage of his escape plan into action: Tarnis transmitted inside information on the security of the Senate Building to Black Sun, allowing a team led by a man named Zeer to infiltrate the building, incapacitate the Republic Military personnel and Coruscant Security officers guarding the doctor, and make it out with Tarnis undetected. Agent Galen and the SIS discovered Tarnis's absence just minutes before the Knight contacted him to report the successful recovery of the stolen weapons and files, and Kira Carsen set off with a CSF team in pursuit of the kidnappers as they fled across the Senate Plaza. Some of the kidnappers, including Tarnis, split off from the others at the Plaza's taxi pad, traveling to Black Sun territory, while Zeer led the rest into the Coruscant Spaceport as a distraction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though Tarnis himself diverted from the Black Sun members to make his way to the sector under the control of his allies in the Imperial-friendly Justicars' Brigade Zeer's men barricaded themselves in Docking Bay 84 and became embroiled in a firefight with Carsen and the CSF officers. Not long afterwards, the Knight and Teeseven returned to the Senate Building and delivered the files to Agent Galen, who handed them off to Krand and his other analysts before sending the Jedi to reinforce Carsen. With Carsen's use of a stealth field generator, the two Jedi and Teeseven were able to break the criminals' lines and capture Zeer, and the Padawan tricked Zeer into revealing where Tarnis had actually been taken by pretending to read his mind. However, during the fight in the spaceport, the SIS discovered that the stolen files had included information on the entire Republic superweapon initiative, putting the offworld weapons facilities at risk of discovery. As a result, Din, Kiwiiks, and Galen each departed Coruscant to secure one of the offworld facilities, traveling to Alderaan, Tatooine, and Nar Shaddaa respectively."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Knight and Teeseven, meanwhile, traveled to Black Sun territory in pursuit of the kidnapped doctor, where Sergeant Nidaljo and his CSF Special tactical unit had been driven back into a nearby apartment building after their attempt to gather information on Black Sun's headquarters in expectation of the Jedi's arrival. After breaking the Black Sun siege of Nidaljo's men, the Knight was able to inspire the disheartened sergeant to continue the mission, and the Jedi and Teeseven launched an assault on the Black Sun base's front entrance while the CSF officers attacked the rear entrance. The Knight and Teeseven reached the building's command center before the CSF officers, only to find Salarr communicating with a hologram of a hooded Tarnis. Revealed to be a Sith Lord, Tarnis ordered Salarr to kill the Jedi before terminating the transmission, but the arrival of Nidaljo and his men saved the Knight from one of the criminals' attempt to sneak up on the Jedi. The police officers and the Knight fought Salarr and his men and killed the gang leader, dealing a significant blow to Black Sun, but the Jedi and Teeseven returned to the Senate Building to discuss what to do about Tarnis's betrayal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After ending the communication with Salarr, Tarnis contacted the Planet Prison design team in the persona of Eli Tarnis and urged his subordinates to bring him the weapon prototype in the Justicars' Sector, claiming that the Jedi were trying to shut down the project. The team believed their leader and departed with the prototype before General Suthra was alerted to Tarnis's true identity, and the general was furious to discover their apparent treason. Having tracked Tarnis's signal to the Justicars' Tower in the Justicars' Sector, Suthra dispatched the Knight to locate Tarnis, and Carsen accompanied her fellow Jedi instead of Teeseven in case they were forced to battle the Sith. While the two Jedi were fighting their way through the hostile Justicars to reach the center, however, the Planet Prison design team met with Tarnis. Revealing himself as a Sith Lord, he murdered four of the five scientists with Force lightning before departing with the prototype, though the fifth scientist\u2014a man named Jonkan\u2014was only mortally wounded.

Urged on by Darth Angral, Tarnis dueled Carsen and the Knight before a hologram of his father, Praven, Nefarid, and Sadic, and Angral was horrified to see his son struck down by the Knight's blade. Furious, Angral declared undying hatred for the Jedi and promised to use the Republic's own weapons to kill billions.

However, the SIS had been able to track Angral's transmission as far as Ord Mantell, prompting General Suthra to send the Knight there to uncover the source of the transmission. Agreeing, the Grand Master appointed Carsen as the Knight's own Padawan in the absence of Master Kiwiiks, and Suthra had a Defender-class light corvette delivered to the Coruscant Spaceport for the Knight.

On Suthra's advice, the Knight took Teeseven along so that the droid could slice into the Imperial base's computer systems, and the two left Carsen behind to guard the ship while they rendezvoused with Agent Ottau. Following Ottau's directions, the pair fought through the Imperial defenders and descended into the subterranean complex, and after defeating the final Imperial\u2014a lieutenant named Marcovic\u2014the Knight stood watch while Teeseven sliced into the listening post's systems and retrieved records of the files and transmissions sent to Angral from Tarnis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, while the Knight and Teeseven were on Ord Mantell's surface, Carsen was identified by operatives of Imperial Intelligence aboard the space station, and the Imperials alerted Darth Angral.

Angral departed the station with Admiral Hacklin and his other retainers to follow up on her information, though he left behind the Sith Inquisitor Ferav to keep her hostage in case she was lying with express orders not to kill her. Upon returning to Agent Ottau, who began organizing a team to take control of the now defenseless Imperial base, the Knight and Teeseven returned to their ship, only to find Ferav as well as several Imperial soldiers and Sith acolytes holding Carsen hostage.
