Marquand was relatively inexperienced with film, coming from a television background, and as a result Lucas was on hand at almost all times during shooting to ensure that the production went smoothly. According to Robert Watts, \"George came and he never left; Richard couldn't grasp it and George was concerned, so he never left.\" Kit West said that \"George was on his shoulder the whole time.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Norman Reynolds commented on Marquand: \"He tried to make the best of it, really, and I think he did.\""}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Editing"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Marquand and his editor Sean Barton created the first cut of Return of the Jedi after principle photography finished. The cut was not well-received by Lucas, prompting him to take over editing for subsequent cuts.

Barton admitted \"We didn't get it right for George\", and Steve Starkey remarked that \"Richard had interpreted George incorrectly or his instincts were moving in a different direction.\" However, Lucas himself acknowledged that \"The first cut on a film is never wonderful.\""}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Relationship with cast and crew"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Carrie Fisher complained about Marquand at length in interviews, reporting that the director didn't treat her or Mark Hamill well.
