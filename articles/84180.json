Located at the end of Ion Alley behind blast doors, it was a well-equipped port staff by a crew of NR-5 Series Repair Droids. Arrivals at the port did not have to provide crew or cargo manifests, but hazardous materials scans were carried out on first time visitors. Refueling and restocking starships were charged at a nominal free, repairs and modifications were available at discount prices, and a minimal docking fee was collected from all ships. Security was maintained by three K4 security droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
