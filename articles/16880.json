During the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY, the smuggler Han Solo used a large crater within this asteroid to hide his starship, the Millennium Falcon, from pursuing Imperial forces under the command of the Dark Lord Darth Vader. However, Solo and his Rebel companions, including Princess Leia Organa, were surprised to learn that the large asteroid crater was actually the gullet of an enormous space slug. Vader, having anticipated that the Millennium Falcon had most likely hid inside one of the asteroids, also deployed the Scimitar Squadron of TIE/sa bombers to bomb the area to flush them out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
