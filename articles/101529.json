The depot was run by a Bith who had a brother on Nal Hutta that would only give them enough fuel to reach Orondia at the depot to scam people. The depot was later visited by a disguised Obi-Wan Kenobi, Cad Bane and Moralo Eval to supply their ship with fuel after escaping from Nal Hutta. As the three fugitives fueled their ship, Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano came to the depot in search of the criminals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
