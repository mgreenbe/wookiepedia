When Skywalker had defeated his adversaries, 3DVO involuntarily fired a tranquilizer dart at him, and a beacon he carried led Prepredenko's soldiers to the location. The Jazbinans Skywalker had fought were revealed to be Rebel sympathizers, with whom the Princess cooperated against her father's wishes, and Skywalker was arrested."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not much later, Darth Vader arrived on the planet, wanting Skywalker turned over to him alive, at all costs.
