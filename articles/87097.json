In order to prevent damage, remotes were usually shot at with light-only blasts. Many smugglers and bounty hunters also used remotes to perfect their quick-draw skills.

Indeed, the younglings were using them, under supervision of Yoda, when Obi-Wan Kenobi came to them for help in locating Kamino. Some variants, however, were modified for actual combat in case the Jedi Temple was attacked, as was demonstrated during Operation: Knightfall."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They were also used as shooting-range targets as part of the training of clone sharpshooters during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the birth of the Galactic Empire, several Marksman-H combat remotes were modified to carry out executions to enemies of the Empire. These execution droids would wander population centers and scan for enemies of the Empire based on the identities of known targets stored in their memory banks. Upon locating them, the targets would be executed on the spot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Luke Skywalker practiced with one aboard the Millennium Falcon.
