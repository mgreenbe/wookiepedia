While not as fast or maneuverable, hovercraft could handle environments which were hazardous to repulsorlift use."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 93-B was used by the galaxy's megacorporations and the Galactic Empire to transport personnel and supplies. A two-man crew operated the craft (although a single pilot could manage on their own) in a command compartment separate from the passenger area. Both were independently sealed and pressurized so that a breach in one compartment did not endanger the other."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The hovercraft's skirt was reinforced with thin plates of duralumin, which not only prevented normal tearing but made it resistant to weapons fire. However the 93-B was not meant for actual combat, and while theoretically it could mount weaponry installing the necessary wiring to control it threatened the integrity of the compartments."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
