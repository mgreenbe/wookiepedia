The mask wearer sought immense power and influence, manipulating powerful individuals in order to do so. He blackmailed a king into giving him a title and land and poisoned a politician to take her role. However, the mask wearer's power gained the envy of those around him, and a former ally betrayed and killed him, stealing the mask. The mask, said to be cursed, eventually came to be owned by the Ithorian collector Dok-Ondar. The collector sold the mask to the ambassador Slokin, who, upon wearing it, was granted visions of the mask wearer's exploits. Slokin used the mask wearer's strategy to gain power for himself, but was eventually killed in a similar way to the original owner."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
