It was equipped with two engines and armed with powerful cannons. In 18 BBY, the starship was well-maintained and no longer new. The agent piloted the ship without need for additional crew, but its sleek design was too small for cargo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The agent flew it when Black Sun sent them to recruit the former Jedi Ahsoka Tano, known by her alias \"Ashla;\" the Togruta had interfered with the syndicate's activities by smuggling for the Fardi clan and aiding beings Black Sun wished to extort. The agent tracked Tano and her freighter to a planet in the Thabeska system. Tano declined joining Black Sun and the two ships engaged in a firefight. The agent's slower guns destroyed a mountainside and struck Tano's starboard engine, causing it to fail, but Tano disabled one of their cannons and damaged their engine manifolds. When another ship arrived and fired upon their ship, the agent fled."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
