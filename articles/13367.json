Therefore, when Republic intelligence discovered the ship on an escort mission, they decided to seize the opportunity to destroy it. To accomplish this goal, they sent a member of the Coruscant Aegis Squadron, supported by at least three Thranta-class corvettes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arriving, the Republic forces immediately began to attack the Scream of Ragnos and its escorts. The three Imperial escorts each attempted to intercept the Republic fleet and suffering heavy damage in the process. The squadron member continued towards the Scream of Ragnos, attacking Mark VI Supremacy-class starfighters and the escorts while nearing the warship. The hero was tasked with damaging four shield generators and twelve laser cannons on the Scream of Ragnos, as well as eliminating 75 interceptors if the opportunity arose. As the battle commenced, three additional Terminus-class destroyers came to the aid of Scream of Ragnos, one of which was destroyed immediately after assisting. The battle ended minutes after beginning and the hero left Zosha's atmosphere, with the destroyed Imperial warship left orbiting the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Zosha Advance was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011. It appears as one of the first upgraded Space Combats available to Republic players. In the Space Combat, players must destroy four of the Scream of Ragnos's shield generators and then fourteen of the ship's sixteen turbolasers. There are also two bonus missions present in the battle. The first is taking out a total of 75 Mark VI interceptors or turrets on the defending ships, a hidden bonus mission, which can only be completed once a day, is to deal enough damage to the Scream of Ragnos's bridge via proton torpedoes so that the ship itself will be destroyed. The mission was an upgraded version of the Makem Te Assault."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
