As he was loading the crate, droid bounty hunter, 4-LOM charged at Solo, shooting at him. 4-LOM shot Han Solo's blaster pistol out of his hand and Solo made a quick dash behind the crate and once again contacted Chewbacca, asking him to hurry up. But 4-LOM's bounty hunter partner, Zuckuss snuck up behind Solo and shot him into a stun net with his electrified net gun. Zuckuss warned Solo not to struggle otherwise the stun net will tighten. The Corellian smuggler tried to Zuckuss by double the pay for the bounty on his head but 4-LOM brushed him off, knowing that it was next to impossible for Solo to pay for the bounty Rekias Nodo had placed on him. Han Solo knew who Rekias Nodo was and tried to convince the bounty hunters that Nodo would betray them but to no avail.

Once 4-LOM left, Solo called out to Ford who was in the prison cell across from him, that he will get them out.
