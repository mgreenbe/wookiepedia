The LC-9 was primarily effective at extreme range and against armored starship hulls, and though it was less effective against shielding, the thermite detonation from its payload would often superheat nearby sections of the target's hull and thereby weaken them against further attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
