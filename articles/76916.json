Years later, in 3 ABY, Kintaka still remembered the song. That year, she was kidnapped by a tribe of Duloks and forced to babysit a Phlog infant named Nahkee at the Dulok Swamp along with friends from her tribe\u2014Wicket W. Warrick, Teebo, Malani, and Latara. Latara formulated a plan to use the lullaby to escape. The scheme began wihen Kintaka began humming the tune. The Dulok Queen, Urgah, heard the performance and sarcastically demanded that Kintaka serenade the entire village. Kintaka complied, accompanied by Latara on her flute. Meanwhile, Teebo secured the aid of several birds known as humming peepers. In conjunction with the birds' fast-beating wings, Kintaka's tune lulled the Duloks to sleep. With their captors dozing, the Ewoks escaped with the baby Phlog."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
