The shuttles were escorting two pirate cargo ferries Filcher and Riirdo which stole two containers worth of munitions from an Imperial armory and arranged a rendezvous with the Rebel Alliance to trade them. However Assault Gunboats and two Delta-class DX-9 stormtrooper transports followed them in pursuit to reclaim the munitions and demanded their surrender. The pirates refused as they believed that with the Rebel starfighters and two more cargo ferries Redbill and Wippet they had the numbers to fight of the Imperials."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Gunboats managed to outfight the numbers and the escort shuttles were destroyed. The pirate cargo ferries were disabled and the crews were arrested. The Rebels were defeated and the munitions recovered by Heavy Lifters Amgis. The incident was recorded and recreated for the Combat chamber to train future pilots such as Maarek Stele."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
