At the meeting, they formulated a plan to retake the planet. The Security Forces would enter Theed while the Gungan Grand Army engaged the Trade Federation Droid Army. The Federation sent three Army units to destroy the Gungans. Army C passed near this base, and the base came under attack. Palmer, a Naboo officer at the base, called for assistance. Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes received her distress call and moved to engage the droid Armored Assault Tanks. Sykes destroyed the Federation laser cannons blocking the bridge and was able to knock out the two tanks. He then entered the base's hangar on the order of Captain Quarsh Panaka, the highest ranking Naboo officer. Sykes took an experimental bomber, which he used to delay Army C in Widow's Valley, thereby contributing to the final victory. At that time, two N-1 starfighters and a Flash speeder were parked at the base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The base appears in the 2000 video game Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo.
