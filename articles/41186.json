Her dark influence had an effect on the local Kath hounds, making them more aggressive than was otherwise normal. Following the Destruction of Taris, Jedi Knight Bastila Shan brought an amnesic Revan, who was a former Dark Lord of the Sith, and his companions to the Dantooine Jedi Enclave. After a meeting with the Jedi Council of the Jedi Enclave Revan was accepted for retraining under the Twi'lek Jedi Master Zhar Lestin. After weeks of training under Lestin, Revan then had to undergo three tests to become a full Padawan, the first of which tested Revan's knowledge of the Jedi Code."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After completion of the first test Lestin sent Revan to Dorak to choose which path he would take as a Jedi, that of a Jedi Guardian, a Jedi Consular, or a Jedi Sentinel. After choosing his path and receiving a lightsaber crystal Revan's second test was to construct his lightsaber. Revan used the Enclave's training room workbench in the creation of his new weapon. Upon completion he showed Lestin his lightsaber and was told to cleanse the Ancient grove as the final test before he could be admitted into the Order as a Padawan. Revan and two companions later found the ancient grove and walked up to Juhani to confront her while she was meditating."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Duel"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Juhani used her force powers to paralyze his companions, and attacked Revan.

Having bested her Master, she did not believe Revan could match her power, but then she realized what Quatra had tried to teach her: humility. She tried to teach her that even one who is true to the teachings of the Jedi may just as easily fall to the dark side by their inability to understand or accept their own limitations. Juhani returned to the Jedi Enclave and met with the Jedi Council. She was accepted back into the order and Revan was praised for what he had accomplished."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Juhani went to to accompany Revan to find the remaining Star Maps and to save the galaxy.

She lashes out at Revan upon his return, saying that Juhani had deserved a better chance from him, and from the Council who had sent him so ill-prepared. Regardless of Revan's intentions she could not be consoled, and she left the Jedi Order, ending up on Korriban and joining the Sith Academy there. On Revan's quest to find the Star Map there, Belaya once again confronted him on Korriban, this time outside the Sith Academy where nobody would stop her. She angrily questioned his presence there, then swearing vengeance for Juhani, she attacked Revan but was killed by the former Sith Lord."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
