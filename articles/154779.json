In 2 BBY, when Galen Marek, secret apprentice of Darth Vader, visited Cloud City on the planet Bespin to find Jedi Master Rahm Kota, the guardsmen were sent with a task force to kill him. Four of them were already at Cloud City, while the remaining one was en-route to the location via a Lambda-class T-4a shuttle. The ones present split up into three units: One, located near the supply dock at the Vapor Room, was tasked with preventing Starkiller from escaping onto the Rogue Shadow via the Force with Rahm Kota; the other was to intercept the two via the path between the supply and balloon docks in case they tried to travel through that area; and the last, composed of two Shadow Guards, was stationed at the balloon dock proper. Ultimately, they fell to Starkiller."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Talents & Abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As members of the Shadow Guards, they were proficient with a lightsaber pike, using it in the duel.
