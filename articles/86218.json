These sturdy suits possessed internal stabilizers which allowed the distribution of energy throughout the frame. This system allowed the wearer to be shielded from attacks that would normally disorient them. The armor was traditionally made of beskar and provided more protection than \"normal\" armor. The suit could also come with a helmet with a HUD (heads up display) which the soldier would use to control his weapons and sensors. It provided the wearer with considerable protection, causing it to remain popular from the Mandalorian Wars to the Dark Wars and possibly further, giving it a value of at least 9500 Republic Credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
