The shop stocked parts for starships, vehicles and related equipment, with basic parts on display and other parts available to order from a warehouse, either to the store or to customers' starships. The shop, which also offered starship repairs, was run by Hal Lars, a Human who in old age came to rely on cybernetic parts for hearing and sight whilst at the store. Lars had extensive knowledge of starships and local happenings on the Wheel and also great memory of previous customers and their problems, all information he was willing to share for a price."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hal's Parts Store first appeared in 2013 in Beyond the Rim, an adventure module written by Sterling Hershey for the Fantasy Flight Games roleplaying game, Star Wars: Edge of the Empire.
