It had four extendable manipulators and a pair of lifting claws. To move around it used a pair of caterpillar treads, and it was fitted with an armored chassis. A cranial turret contained audio and video sensors, and it was equipped with a directional transponder and laser scanner. The laser scanner allowed the DC5-1 to scan the identity bands on cargo modules and determine where it had to be offloaded to. The scanner could also recode an identity band for new cargo loaded into the module."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
