Their hunt leads them to the lawless Calamari system, which has become the stronghold of a pirate syndicate led by the Sith Darth Luft. Darth Luft has lured many Mon Calamari and Quarren refugees back to Dac under the pretext of a project to restore Dac, whose oceans had been poisoned by the One Sith during the Second Imperial Civil War. Jao, Ania, and their Mon Calamari and Quarren guides Luen and Tikin are dumped in an escape pod into the poisoned oceans of Dac and face imminent death if they come into contact with even a single drop of the poisoned oceans.

Meanwhile on Coruscant, the Imperial Knight Master Yalta Val receives Jao's transmission. He brings the plight of the Mon Calamari and Quarren before the Galactic Federation Triumvirate leadership but is rebuffed by Empress Fel.

Jao and Tikin return to the shipyards to fight the Sith and to save his son respectively. Meanwhile, Ania, Sauk, AG-37, and Luen return to AG-37's freighter.
