It consisted of a white dress, a cape covered in layers of pale pink and yellow veils, and an ivory organza net with a hand-stitched floral pattern that stretched behind the head like a ruff. A panel down the front was decorated with the Symbol of the Royal House of Naboo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala wore one in 32 BBY, during a parade celebrating the liberation of Naboo from the Trade Federation. Decades later, Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan briefly borrowed one such dress from Queen Daln\u00e9 of the Naboo, wearing it while visiting Imperial Moff Quarsh Panaka. The dress increased Leia's resemblance to her long-deceased birth mother Padm\u00e9 enough to give Panaka a considerable shock when he saw her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The jubilation dress was created for the 1999 prequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.
