After they had engaged in a heated battle, there was brief pause in the fight when security shields separated Maul from Qui-Gon. Jinn took advantage of the break in the duel to crouch down and enter a Serenity trance. When the shields deactivated, Jinn emerged from his trance and immediately attacked Maul. However, the Jedi Master eventually lost the battle and his life to the Sith Lord."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Yoda"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Yoda was on a mission to Rugosa where he encountered Asajj Ventress and a battalion of battle droids and Armored Assault Tanks. Yoda only had three clone troopers, and they were already low on ammunition. Ordering his clones to temporarily hold position, Yoda jumped down into canyon into the midst of the army and entered into a Serenity trance. After thinking he had cut off the Jedi Master's escape, OOM command battle droid 224 contacted Ventress to tell her he located the Jedi. When 224 described Master Yoda's pose, Ventress became very alarmed and ordered the droids to open fire immediately. However, Yoda emerged from his Serenity trance and destroyed the three tanks and a large number of droids. With the help of his three clones, Master Yoda was able to destroy the entire battalion of droid forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
