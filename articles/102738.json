Shortly after the end of the Clone Wars in the year 19 BBY, the Senator Dewell Bronk landed on the planet on a transport that had traveled from Coruscant. Bronk had to transfer to Pad 560 to continue on his journey into the Outer Rim Territories, but while trying to reach the pad ran into two clone troopers who attempted to arrest him. The Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi then saved Bronk, allowing him to reach Pad 560 and board his transport."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pad 560 first appeared in \"Incognito,\" a short story by author John Jackson Miller and illustrated by Chris Scalf, which was published in Star Wars Insider 143 in 2013.
