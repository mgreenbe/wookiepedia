The Third Guard was stationed in Snoke's throne room along with the other Praetorian Guards at the time of Kylo Ren's audience with the Supreme Leader in 34 ABY. Angered by Snoke's disapproving appraisal of his defeat on Starkiller Base, the Master of the Knights of Ren took a step in his master's direction, causing the Third Guard to snap into a combat stance against the dark apprentice as his fellows."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Third Guard was still present in the throne room when Ren returned with the Jedi learner Rey as his prisoner. However, instead of executing the former scavenger as Snoke ordered, Ren chose to assassinate his master\u2014resulting in a confrontation between the two Force-sensitives and the Praetorian Guards. Like the other Praetorians, the Third Guard attempted to avenge the slain Supreme Leader, engaging the traitorous apprentice and Rey. After the death of one of his fellow guards, the Third Guard entangled Rey's lightsaber with his Bilari electro-chain whip and pulled her towards him, after which he grabbed her from the throat to pierce it with the sharp edge of his weapon. But the Third Guard underestimated the young apprentice's skills: Rey broke free from the weapon and fatally cut the Third Guard from his groin to the back. The remaining Praetorians were soon killed also."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
