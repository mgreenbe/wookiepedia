He frequented disguises and various personae during the mission as part of his acting specialty. The final disguise and persona he adopted in the Thaal mission was that of Embassy-Who-Climbs, who was part of a fictitious primitive species native to Kuratooine, where Turman pretended that his (Embassy-Who-Climbs) people had valuable jewels and diamonds that Thaal could exploit for wealth. The bait worked and Thaal was lured to the planet earlier than expected. From thereon, Wraith Squadron saw to his incarceration for his involvement with the Lecersen Conspiracy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Turman often presented himself as a comically melodramatic individual to his fellow Wraith Squadron members, emphasized by his acting talents. These talents proved crucial to the squadron's mission to bring General Thaal to justice, especially when Turman adopted the persona of Embassy-Who-Climbs. Turman also demonstrates an impressive stay in character whenever he adopts a role, and this even helped Wraith Squadron try to understand what Thaal's plans were when he was drugged; when this happened, he began thinking what Thaal's motivations could be by adopting what he believed to be the General's character."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
