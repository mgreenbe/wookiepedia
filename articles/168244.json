Known members included Zeta Leader Commander Jad \"Scorch\" Bean and Zeta Ace \"Longshot\". The remaining TIE/sf space superiority fighter pilots from Starkiller Base, humiliated by their failure following its destruction, were eager to prove their worth in pursuit of the Resistance. The squadron, including its leader, \"Scorch\", participated in a battle against Resistance MG-100 StarFortress SF-17 bombers and X-wing starfighters over the planet D'Qar. As the squadron utilized TIE/fo fighters, these pilots enjoyed higher survival rates than their predecessors in the Galactic Empire, due to technologies originally researched by the Empire's TIE Advanced program that were later mass produced on First Order starfighters and unhampered by a cumbersome galactic bureaucracy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
