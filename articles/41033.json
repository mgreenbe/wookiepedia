When Supreme Chancellor Palpatine betrayed the Jedi and issued Contingency Order 66 to the Grand Army which demanded the death of all Jedi, Cairnwick fled to his homeworld in the Minos Cluster following the arrest of his teachers. Setting a home for himself, Cairnwick spread anti-Imperial propaganda amongst his neighbors, all the while hiding his identity as a member of the Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over time, Cairnwick's propagating led to the Adarlon peoples' desire to rebel against their Imperial masters on Coruscant. Incurring the Emperor's wrath, Adarlon was besieged by stormtroopers; Cairnwick had fled his compound before it was laid waste by the Empire's forces. Remaining in hiding for several years, the rebel was finally captured in the months following the historic Battle of Yavin, a victorious conflict for the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Transported to the prison world of Gesaril, Cairnwick managed to rally support for the Alliance amongst the prison population. Teaming with a group of Alliance prisoners of war, Cairnwick and the Rebels escaped offworld before the stormtroopers could seal the facility."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
