The ring was encoded to open protected data systems, and was used to contact the former Sith Lord Maul, the secret true leader of Crimson Dawn.

When meeting with and then murdering Diles Anevi, Vos wore the ring. Afterwards, after a brief exchange with Tobias Beckett, Vos was introduced to Han Solo and Chewbacca, with the ring still on his finger. When Vos and his top lieutenant Qi'ra received the three scoundrels in Vos's office, both wore their respective versions of the ring."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, when the First Light arrived on Savareen, Vos was engaged in combat against Han Solo and Qi'ra. With the ring on his finger, Vos fought valiantly but was ultimately defeated and killed, having been surprised by the fellow ring-wielder Qi'ra's betrayal. After Vos's death, Qi'ra removed his ring from his finger and used it to contact Darth Maul to inform him what had occurred. After receiving instructions to regroup with Maul on Dathomir, Qi'ra abandoned Han on Savareen, with both rings now in her possession."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
