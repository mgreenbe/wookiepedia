Their ship was ransacked by the crew of the local crime boss, Oga Garra, who controlled the outpost. Moradi took a job at Savi & Son Salvage to earn enough to buy back her stolen supplies. She met Garra, who said that if Moradi brought back a certain artifact from the ruins, Moradi could have her property back.

Moradi pretended to get captured to keep Kath distracted while Kriki programmed the First Order ship to send a message that the Resistance was no longer a concern on Batuu, and then self-destruct. Young people from Dolin's homestead joined the cause due to the First Order killing two villagers, but they were untrained and took casualties. Archex got Kath to take him prisoner, knowing that Kath would not leave without a victory such as capturing Archex. Kriki's reprogramming was a success; when the ship blasted off, it sent the message and exploded with Kath and Archex on board.
