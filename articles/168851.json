Slavery was brought up again when the Zygerrians collaborated with the Separatists during the Clone Wars and still flourished during the Reign of the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Zygerrian Slave Empire's height, the population had fortresses and cities built on top of the mesas scattered throughout the planet, using slave labor. Such cities and fortresses were very detailed and consistent in design throughout. Many areas or parts of cities were solely used for housing slaves, with regular round-the-clock guard patrols and multiple cells or grates lined in rows below the floor. Food would be dropped or slid in and air supplied through open grates in the ceiling. Species such as the Togruta species were common for use in places like the Zygerrian Royal Palace. Arenas or stadiums were likewise present throughout cities where fights could be held and bets be placed by guests/onlookers. Countless rich or powerful people/beings traveled to and from Zygerria or its slave colonies looking for cheap labor to be used in businesses or just for general servitude in a wide range of capacities, depending on what customers wanted. By the time of the Clone Wars, Zygerria was thriving once more and even made joint operations with the CIS Military in order to prosper, due to the alliance made between the Queen of Zygerria and Count Dooku. This was until Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano and Obi-Wan Kenobi led a military operation to locate and rescue a population of Togrutas who went missing, which was later found to be due to a Zygerrian/Separatist Operation. Only a portion of the missing Togrutas were saved as the remaining portion of them were taken directly to Zygerria. After safely completing the mission, Anakin, Ahsoka, Captain Rex and Obi-Wan traveled to Zygerria as well. Anakin posed himself as a wealthy slave owner looking to purchase more labor with Ahsoka as his personal slave while Rex and Obi-Wan disguised themselves as Zygerrian guards in order to locate the rest of the Togrutas. Anakin eventually met the Zygerrian Queen, after which she quickly came to love Anakin. Soon Obi-Wan found the rest of the Togrutas but in the process was discovered and arrested. Anakin and Ahsoka were quickly suspected by the Queen to be part of the attempt to free the slaves and therefore, Anakin was ordered to fight Obi-Wan in an arena to prove his loyalty. About to strike down his master, Anakin called for R2-D2, also present, to supply their lightsabers. Despite the effort, all operatives were caught. Rex and Obi-Wan were forced to work as slaves themselves with Ahsoka being placed in a cage hanging over the side of the Royal Palace. Anakin meanwhile, woke up in the Zygerrian Queen's room as she wanted his loyalty and love, giving him another chance to prove it. Count Dooku was eventually informed of what was happening on Zygerria and personally traveled there to confront the Queen concerning her relations with the Jedi, specifically Anakin. When Anakin found Dooku after his arrival, Dooku threatened to kill the Queen at which Anakin showed how he had no feelings whatsoever for the Queen and that Dooku could kill her for all he cared, after which, Dooku did kill the Queen, blaming it on Anakin and forcing him to flee."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
