They came from the snowy northern mountains of Naboo, and their thick coats required shearing in warmer climates. They were majestic beasts with thick, black (white at birth), silky fur, and long, thick, fur-covered tails. The head boasted a pair of forward-curving horns, while a tusk grew out of either side of the mouth. The hooves of the guarlara were larger than those of the gualama, allowing for sure-footedness in mountain terrain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Guarlara fur was used by Naboo humans in clothing and tapestries.
