Before vacating the planet, the Imperials stripped the dam of its exterior plating. Since this time, it has on occasion served as a haven for criminals. It burst in 5 ABY and flooded the Valley of Royalty with toxic waste. Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Ken were able to save several Duros archeologists, but Grand Moff Bertroff Hissa lost his limbs to the acid flood."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
