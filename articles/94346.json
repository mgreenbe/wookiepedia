Under the command of the Sith Lord Darth Vader, Imperial Major Stafuv Rahz and a complement of stormtroopers kidnapped Lin and most of her class, hoping to use them to draw out key Rebel leaders. Only Lin's son Berd escaped, and he managed to recruit Rebels Luke Skywalker and Han Solo to lead a rescue mission.
