During the year 1 BBY, NB4, while performing his duties as a serving droid for the Star, encountered Lieutenant Kyle Katarn, a recently established officer of the Galactic Empire. Believing him to be a person of interest, NB4 reported him to Slyder."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A little while later, NB4 was sent after the passenger Jan Ors, whom Slyder identified as a Rebel Alliance agent, and bugged her starship with a remote transmitter. NB4's espionage eventually revealed a relationship between Ors and Katarn that ended with the officer defecting from the Empire.

Using hidden cameras, Slyder was able to identify them as Jan Ors, Rosco Ross, Ris Waller, and the protocol droid A-Cee. Meanwhile, NB4 posed as one of the many Star of Empire servant droids and led the recent Imperial graduate Lieutenant Kyle Katarn to his quarters aboard the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having heard that the luxury ship's owners\u2014the Haj family\u2014had rebel sympathies, Katarn questioned NB4 on the matter. The droid was initially confused by Katarn's use of a metaphor, but eventually admitted that he didn't know. He did, however, brief Katarn on the layout and purpose of the ship. Having found Katarn to be of interest, NB4 reported him to Slyder. Katarn later left his bunk, and eventually ended up in the ship's game room, where he caught a glimpse of Ors and, having recognized her from an early mission of his, attempted to follow her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Slyder witnessed these events and through his suspicion had NB4 keep tabs on Ors. NB4 eventually found her in the Star of Empire's hangar, where he noticed Ors struggling with the repairs she was making to her starship Truly Sorry. NB4 offered assistance, but Ors declined. Having nonetheless learned Ors' first name, NB4 left to rendezvous with Slyder, but not before placing a hidden transmitter on her ship. The transmitter recorded a conversation between Ors and Katarn, during which Katarn announced his intention to defect. With this new information in hand, Slyder then explained to NB4 what his lengthy tenure aboard the Star was all about."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Slyder thanked the droid for his assistance and competence, the latter of which NB4 claimed to only exist because of the years of experience he attained by being at the bounty hunter's side. Afterwards, Slyder left his cabin to meet with the Imperial governor Dol Donar II in order to sell his services to the Empire and catch the rebel agents. Slyder never returned, however, as he was killed aboard Dol Donar's yacht when it exploded just outside the Star of Empire while in pursuit of the Truly Sorry, thus ending NB4 and Slyder's long standing partnership."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of many service droids aboard the Star of Empire, NB4 was an auspicious spy that drew little attention to himself. Neither Katarn nor Ors were able to ascertain NB4's ulterior motives while in contact with him, and the droid was discreet enough to plant a transmitter on Ors' ship without her notice. NB4 believed his abilities were to be attributed to Slyder's tutelage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "NB4 had a keen photoreceptor for interesting individuals, and successfully targeted Katarn as a valuable target. NB4's unassuming nature allowed him to get close to his targets and gain their trust, which in turn aided his role as an assisting porter droid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a porter droid aboard a luxury liner, NB4 encountered various alien species during his work, and happened to be very knowledgeable about the Star of Empire's crew and layout, save for some of their political loyalties. Katarn's use of the metaphorical term \"share coordinates,\" which referred to two parties secretly working together, briefly confused the droid until Katarn explained the meaning. Pleased with having learned something new, NB4 attempted to use the same metaphor while speaking to Slyder, although the Rodian did not understand it. NB4 did not explain its meaning, however."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character of NB4 was created for the audio drama based on the William C. Dietz novella Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire. NB4 himself, however, was not originally featured in the novella\u2014Slyder seemingly worked alone in the novella. Rather, NB4's purpose, as apparent from the majority of his dialogue, was to serve as a method of translating a portion of the novella's prose into spoken words in order to explain the backstory of certain events and characters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Part of NB4's dialogue, however, directly contradicts the prose from the novella that dealt with the length of Slyder's stay on the Star of Empire. In the novella, Dietz wrote that Slyder lived on the Star for a total of three years. NB4, however, claims that Slyder had been living on the Star for seven years. For the purposes of this article, the three year span is deemed the correct number, as it comes from the original source, as opposed to the audio drama which tried to abridge the novella for narrative purposes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
