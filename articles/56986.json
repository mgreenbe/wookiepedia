Approximately six years before the Battle of Yavin, this team played the AppSci SaberCats, who had already won their first three matches of the season. The SaberCats won the match in an absolute rout, defeating the Green Dragons by a margin of twenty-six points. The game largely consisted of Zare Leonis throwing the ball to his teammates Claith Bennis and Frid Kelio for touch-scores while Merei Spanjaf kept the other team pinned in their own territory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
