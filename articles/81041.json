Although primarily the building was used as a location for the gang to hang out, it also served as a cantina, serving drinks to those inside and equipped with booths for people to sit. However, there was a password required to get in the establishment, in order to keep out enemies of the gang. When Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca infiltrated the den, Chewbacca was able to make his way inside by simply roaring at the doorman, perhaps denoting that the security to the hideout was not of the highest caliber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
