All of the facility's other asteroids were anchored to the Hub. The Hub was the location of the primary offices and laboratories, along with the main computer core. Other facilities, including the living quarters, dining areas and recreational areas were also located within the Hub. The docking bay on the Hub was capable of accommodating two shuttles at a time. While the Hub was armed with weapon emplacements, they were not capable of fully defending the facility. The four Star Destroyers assigned to the Maw were intended to fulfil that purpose. The Hub connected to the five lab modules\u2014A, B, C, D, and E\u2014and the Imperial Garrison."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
