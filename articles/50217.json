Its modifications included at least four weapons, with one mounted on the nose of the vessel, and three on the underside. While in the ownership of the pirate Hondo Ohnaka, it was painted brown and gray, with yellow detailing and the Ohnaka Gang's red logo painted on its nose and sides."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Fortune and Glory was owned by the Weequay leader of the Ohnaka Gang pirates, Hondo Ohnaka, who considered the vessel his pride and joy and named it for his two favorite things. During the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Ohnaka was hired by the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker to illegally deliver a shipment of RPS-6 rocket launchers to a group of rebels fighting against the Separatist regime of the planet Onderon. As the conflict was technically an internal affair, the Republic could not be seen to be officially involved, meaning Skywalker hired Ohnaka and his pirates in secret to act as a third party aiding the resistance. Traveling from their base on the planet Florrum, the Ohnaka gang flew the Fortune and Glory to Onderon, landing at the the nest at which the rebels were based."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship's approach was spotted by the resistance, who greeted it with raised weapons and suspicion; however, the Jedi padawan Ahsoka Tano, who was discreetly aiding the rebels, recognized the ship and ordered the Onderians to stand down. The pirates immediately began unloading the weaponry from the yacht, while Ohnaka greeted Tano and the rebels and explained that he had brought the missile launchers on Skywalker's orders. As Ohnaka spoke, he was cut off by the arrival of three BX-series droid commandos, who had spotted the Fortune and Glory while on patrol. The droids opened fire on the rebels and pirates, prompting the Ohnaka gang to quickly board the Fortune and Glory and take their leave of Onderon, their mission complete. The resistance took the launchers and used them against Separatist HMP droid gunships, eventually successfully overthrowing the Separatist regime."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Florrum was captured by Separatist forces later in the war, the Fortune and Glory was hidden away from Ohnaka's base in a secret vault where the pirate stored his personal fleet. Ohanaka and several members of his gang managed to escape the Separatists alongside Tano and several Jedi younglings and fled to the vault in order to escape the planet. The group became separated along the way, with Ohnaka and his pirates, plus the youngling Katooni reaching the vault, but the others being chased in a separate direction by Separatist General Grievous. Ohanaka chose to abandon the Fortune and Glory, instead boarding the Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft Slave I, which he used to save the Jedi and then flee Florrum. The pirate and his gang later returned to Florrum and reclaimed their base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Fortune and Glory first appeared in \"Tipping Points,\" the fifth episode in Season Five of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series, which aired in 2012.
