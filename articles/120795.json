They were vulnerable in bright light due to their poor vision, often residing in shady or dark areas. While visiting Zeffo during the Imperial Era, the former Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis was attacked by several scazz. Their meat was considered to be edible."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Scazz first appeared in the 2019 video game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, developed by Respawn Entertainment.
