As a young man, Quest was a member of the Jedi Order, but did not continue on the path to knighthood, instead being assigned to the Agricultural Corps. It was there that he was personally discovered by then\u2014Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Quest began to work secretly for Palpatine on a variety of projects, becoming known as the \"Chancellor's Hand\". When the Republic transitioned into the Galactic Empire, with Palpatine as the new Emperor, Quest became a noted member of the Imperial Court, eventually becoming accepted into the Imperial Ruling Council. In this capacity, he was also able to spy on Palpatine's political enemies. However, when Palpatine died in the Battle of Endor, Quest seized his opportunity to take power. He manipulated the Ruling Council into supporting the Force-sensitive Royal Guard Carnor Jax as a new leader, gaining a great deal of political power in the process."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Palpatine returned in 10 ABY, resurrected through the use of a series of clone bodies, Quest returned to his service, but maintained his own loyalties. He had grown fond of the power that he had acquired before Palpatine's return and resolved to eliminate his former master. Using funds obtained from traitorous elements within the Ruling Council, Quest and Jax bribed the Emperor's personal physician to sabotage Palpatine's clones, decreasing their lifespan and accelerating the Emperor's death. With Palpatine gone, Quest and Jax quickly seized power, but their rule was short-lived. Jax was killed by the loyalist Kir Kanos as revenge for his role in Palpatine's death, and without Jax's support, Quest was thrown out of the Ruling Council and went into hiding to avoid loyalist Imperials seeking revenge. In 23 ABY, Quest was captured by bounty hunter Ailyn Vel who turned him over to another former Emperor's Hand Jeng Droga, in exchange for a 100,000 credit bounty.

However, Quest was discovered by Galactic Republic Supreme Chancellor Palpatine who pulled Quest away from his career as a farmer. Quest became Palpatine's loyal servant, becoming known as the \"Chancellor's Hand\". He was not often seen at Palpatine's side, spending a considerable amount of time on the Deep Core world of Byss. Working alongside another of Palpatine's servants, the Umbaran Sly Moore, Quest trained other Force-sensitives who had been recruited from the AgriCorps. Quest and Moore worked to turn these individuals to the dark side of the Force, building a force of darksiders for their master. Around this time, Chancellor Palpatine engaged the services of the Shi'ido scientists Mammon Hoole and Borborygmus Gog in secret experiments involving the spontaneous generation of life. Their first attempt was rumored to have had less than ideal results\u2014Niobi, a female subject obtained by Sly Moore, gave birth to a three-eyed mutant.

Quest was placed into the newly formed Imperial Intelligence and recruited into a special Intelligence program that was secretly watched over by Palpatine himself. This program provided individuals with Force training and groomed the members to become an Emperor's Hand, elite dark side users that reported directly to Palpatine. Quest graduated from this program and joined the ranks of that elite group. As Palpatine's servant, Quest became a prominent member of the Imperial Court, wearing expensive clothes and building a reputation as a playboy. However, Quest's court persona was a cover for his other work for Palpatine, spying on his master's political enemies. Among those that Quest kept tabs on were Senator Seti Ashgad and Moff Fliry Vorru. As a member of the Imperial Court, Quest became associated with one of Palpatine's concubines, Roganda Ismaren. He and Ismaren conceived a child together, which forced Ismaren to abandon the Imperial Court and work to become an Emperor's Hand. Quest and Ismaren's son, Irek was strong in the Force, and his mother concealed his true heritage, letting others assume that her son was Palpatine's offspring. These rumors, which hid Quest's connection to her son, allowed Ismaren to groom Irek as a possible heir to the Imperial throne. Despite impregnating one of Palpatine's mistresses, Quest's influence in the Imperial Court steadily grew to a point where he was allowed a place on the Imperial Ruling Council, the first darksider to be accepted into its ranks. In 1 ABY, Sly Moore, who also maintained a presence in the Imperial Court, disappeared from Coruscant. The experimentation in spontaneously creating life started by Hoole and Gog had been continued by Sly Moore. Her efforts resulted in her giving birth to another three-eyed mutant.

Under the Emperor's orders, he romanced Yasinda Bardak, an Imperial Intelligence agent working undercover on the planet. Bardak was a Force-sensitive woman who had dropped out of an Imperial program that was grooming her to become an Emperor's Hand, due to her belief that the Force did not exist. However, despite dropping out of the program, the Emperor had further designs for Bardak and assigned Quest to get close to her.

Although Bardak attempted to be reassigned to a different planet, frightened by her strange new abilities, her requests were denied as Quest and Palpatine continued the experiment.

The resulting power vacuum from his death saw the Imperial Ruling Council attempt to take control of the Empire.

Pestage eventually decided to abandon the Empire and retreat to the Deep Core world of Byss to concentrate on dark side experimentation. He left a clone behind to maintain order, but the rapid gestation of the Pestage clone caused the copy to become insane. Unable to deal with the mad Pestage clone, Quest withdrew his support, leaving the clone to the Imperial Ruling Council and Imperial Intelligence director Ysanne Isard, resulting in the clone's death. Quest assumed that the true Pestage would contact him, but when he failed to do so, Quest allied himself to a member of the Emperor's Royal Guard, Carnor Jax. Jax was Force-sensitive with ambitions towards the Imperial throne, and Quest threw his support behind him, convincing the Imperial Ruling Council to support Jax as the new Imperial leader. Quest's partnership with Jax also involved teaching the Royal Guard new Force powers, and granting him control of a military taskforce.

With Quest's support, Jax was promoted into the Sovereign Protectors, the highest rank of the Royal Guard. However, Quest held no loyalty for Palpatine, as he was reluctant to give up the power that he and the Imperial Ruling Council had gained before his master's return.
