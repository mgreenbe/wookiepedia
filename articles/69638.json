Jax agreed, stating that they were all in it together. As time went on, Jax befriended Boba Fett, unaware that Fett was secretly attempting to kill Mace Windu for the death of his father, infamous bounty hunter Jango Fett at the First Battle of Geonosis, the first battle of the Clone Wars. He aided in the evacuation of the Endurance when the ships hall was damaged by Fett.

Boba apologized for it and as Aurra ordered Boba to jettison the cadets into nowhere, Boba protested, saying the crew had nothing to do with his revenge against the Jedi and Windu, but Sing coldly ordered him to do it. Boba reluctantly agreed and jettisoned Jax and the clones into nowhere. Just before being jettisoned, Jax shouted to Boba that he was going to regret this. Several minutes after they were jettisoned, he and Whiplash then had a small fight regarding Boba, when they were rescued by Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, who took them in his starship.
