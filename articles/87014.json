VI interceptor, was a model of fighter used by the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War. The Empire utilized this model of starfighter during the attack on the Republic shipyards in the Sluis sector and the Battle of Alderaan. Darth Malgus also made use of these vessels during the Battle of Ziost and the Sacking of Coruscant. The Mark VI had minimal shielding and was very lightly armed. The craft did not come equipped with proton nor concussion missile launchers. The Mark VI's advantages were its powerful engines and rapid-fire laser cannons, which were used by pilots to engage in complex swarm tactics."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
