In 21 BBY, the second year of the war, Dooku conspired with General Grievous and Rish Loo to launch another invasion of the planet, a plot that would involve turning the Gungans and the Gungan Grand Army against the Naboo people. When Minister Rish Loo began influencing Boss Lyonie, the leader of the Gungan community Otoh Gunga, to behave strangely and call for a Gungan alliance with the Separatists and an attack on Theed, Representative Jar Jar Binks invited his allies, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, to help in the investigation into Lyonie's actions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After arriving on Naboo, Skywalker and Amidala learned that Rish Loo was using a hypnotic necklace to control Lyonie's brain. Anakin destroyed the necklace, bringing Lyonie back to his senses and causing him to regret declaring an attack on the Naboo.Upon being discovered, Rish Loo stabbed Lyonie in an attempt to kill him and fled Otoh Gunga. While Lyonie was recovering, Padm\u00e9 and Anakin noticed that Jar-Jar shared an uncanny resemblance to Lyonie, so they made Jar-Jar disguise as Lyonie to stop the invasion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The skirmish"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rish Loo went to the assembled Gungan Grand Army and told them that Lyonie was dead, ordering them to attack Naboo immediately. Jar-Jar showed up at that moment, posing as Lyonie. He denounced Rish Loo, who fled to his laboratory. Anakin followed Rish Loo, fighting the probe droids Rish Loo sent to stop him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Grievous and his army landed on Naboo aboard C-9979 landing craft. The tactical droid commander informed Jar-Jar that Grievous wanted to know why the attack on Theed was cancelled. Jar-Jar entered Grievous's lander and negotiated with the general. Meanwhile, Padm\u00e9 contacted Tarpals and told him to take advantage of the alliance with the Separatists and shut down the droids while they weren't expecting it. Grievous figured out that Jar-Jar was not Lyonie, so he chased the Gungan outside, where he found his entire army deactivated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As it began to rain, the Gungan army surrounded Grievous and told him to surrender. Grievous scoffed at both the very idea and the Gungans resistance before drawing two lightsabers. He managed to deflect several boomas, but was disarmed of his green-bladed lightsaber by another. Several Gungan warriors attacked him, with two dying in the process before Tarpals attacked him with an electric spear. In spite of his experience, the seasoned Gungan general was no match for Grievous, who stabbed him with a spear he had taken from a fallen Gungan. As he was dying, Tarpals used his final gasp of energy to drive his spear into Grievous's armor. As electricity surged through Grievous, the other Gungan warriors threw boombas at Grievous, disabling his cyborg body and knocking him down. He was then taken prisoner, though Tarpals had already died before any aid could be given."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Capture of Skywalker"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker, meanwhile, found Dooku's lair, after following Rish Loo to the ancient structure. Little did Skywalker know, however, that, in the wake of Grievous' capture, Dooku was looking to capture Skywalker so as to force a hostage trade between the opposing factions. When Rish Loo approached Dooku and began to speak of their ongoing plans, Dooku denounced Loo as a \"fool,\" before abruptly stabbing him with his lightsaber, just as Anakin arrived in the chamber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dooku and Anakin then briefly had a heated discussion regarding the invasion, in which Dooku revealed that the Sith were not only behind the current invasion, but had orchestrated the first invasion as well. Dooku then engaged in a duel with Anakin, with the latter gaining the upper hand. Dooku broke off Anakin's attack by barraging him with lamps. While Anakin managed to deflect this barrage, he quickly found himself overwhelmed by Dooku's attending MagnaGuards. Forced to battle the MagnaGuards along with Dooku, Skywalker became incapacitated by several electric shocks, to which he used a Force Wave to knock back the Magnaguards. Surprised, Dooku then assaulted Skywalker with a Force choke, followed up by Force lightning. Skywalker was subdued and captured."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Prisoner exchange"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly following the captures of Grievous and Skywalker, Padm\u00e9 Amidala was attempting to contact Anakin from Otoh Gunga, when Dooku appeared on her holoprojector. Inquiring as to what he wanted, Dooku informed Amidala that he had captured Skywalker, while commanding his droids to torture Skywalker through the use of several electric shocks. Dooku then stated that he would be willing to exchange Skywalker for Grievous in a prisoner transfer, and gave her an hour to come to a decision"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amidala, shocked and upset at the capture of her secret husband, was conflicted between her duties to the Republic and her duties to Anakin. Though initially hesitant to give up Grievous due to his importance in the war effort, Jar Jar, who was also present, reminded her that Anakin was \"their friend,\" finally causing her to relent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time thereafter, the prisoner trade took place, with the tactical droid arriving to lead negotiations for the Separatists, while Neeyutnee and Lyonie, alongside Amidala and Jar Jar, were there to represent the Republic. After Grievous had been released to the custody of the Separatists, the tactical droid ordered Anakin's subsequent release. After being unceremoniously dropped, still unconscious, at the feet of the opposing negotiators, along with his lightsaber, the Separatist forces left to depart the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While all those attending the exchange were upset at the release of Grievous and the Separatists' subsequent escape, Neeyutnee and Lyonie alike lauded Jar Jar for restoring peace between their two peoples for a second time, even at the expense of letting Grievous go."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
