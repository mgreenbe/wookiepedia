Death troopers were elite stormtroopers created by the Tarkin Initiative and assigned to Imperial Intelligence, and deployed for protecting high-ranking officials of the Galactic Empire as well as undertaking covert missions. The unit was initially composed of seven death troopers with Sergeant Cordo acting as the unit's commanding officer, with several death trooper specialists as characterized by their pauldron and additional equipment. When the unit was reduced to three members, they all underwent extensive cybernetic repair work."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The unit, due to its actions and supreme service to the Empire, was then personally chosen by Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader to serve as his own guard unit. Of the three remaining members, only one death trooper served as a specialist. During the unit's service, they utilized a TIE/rp Reaper attack lander and a Lambda-class T-4a shuttle, and were equipped with death trooper armor, E-11D blaster carbines, and DLT-19D heavy blaster rifles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early service"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The unit of death troopers served in the Imperial Era, as part of the Galactic Empire's Imperial Military forces and were originally stormtroopers before being selected to be trained as death troopers. After rigorous training and body augmentations, the unit graduated and were officially designated as death troopers, with several serving as death trooper specialists."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "First mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 ABY, the unit of death troopers were assigned to Sergeant Cordo aboard an Imperial-class Star Destroyer during the Galactic Civil War. Their first mission was to destroy a Rebel Alliance v-150 Planet Defender, as an Imperial admiral did not want to risk their vessel by getting too close to the cannon. After the briefing, Sergeant Cordo and the death troopers boarded a TIE/rp Reaper and travelled to the world that hosted the Rebel Alliance's cannon and landed nearby, deploying the death trooper unit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While moving forward into a tree line, the unit of death troopers was ambushed by a contingent of rebel troopers and killed at least one trooper in an explosion. A skirmish subsequently erupted in the area, with the death trooper unit sustaining several more casualties. After the initial assault, the remaining death troopers moved out of the trees and closer to the cannon, but encountered more rebel infantry. While the skirmish was occurring, Sergeant Cordo used his macrobinoculars to observe the death troopers from the Reaper, and noticed that the death troopers were moving in too close to the cannon without cover. As Cordo was criticizing the death troopers, only four were remaining as they encountered more resistance. During the skirmish in the field, one death trooper was gunned down, but then used as a shield by another."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After neutralizing the infantry threat, the remaining three maneuvered closer to the cannon, with Cordo saying that they got closer than they deserved. Cordo then noticed that the cannon was targeting the death troopers. Believing that the death troopers did not heed his words, Cordo used the TIE Reaper to sacrifice himself and destroy the cannon by attacking it, but failed when he was shot down and crashed at the summit of the cannon. Barely surviving the crash by being pinned down and situated by the engines, the death troopers arrived to Cordo's location as Cordo believed they were saving him. The death troopers, however, began firing on the engines in order to detonate the wreckage of the Reaper. As Cordo stated and realized that they were in fact paying attention to his earlier advice, the craft exploded, engulfing the troopers in an explosion, killing Cordo, and destroying the cannon."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Serving Darth Vader"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chosen by the Dark Lord"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of the mission, the three death troopers were taken to a medical bay for repair work and medical attention. A lieutenant then arrived and confirmed with the 2-1B-series medical droid if they were the troopers that killed Cordo. The droid confirmed, but stated that they also completed their mission and that the lieutenant could review the mission's tapes. The lieutenant dismissed it, and ordered the droid to terminate their life support since the Empire did not require traitors. At that moment, Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader arrived at the medical bay and killed the lieutenant, confirming that the Empire did not need traitors but victors, and ordered the droid to continue its repair work, which included extensive cybernetics."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Vader's mission for punishment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, all three remaining death troopers made a full recovery and were active during the Duel on Cloud City when they were headquartered on Vader's flagship, the Executor. Following the Millennium Falcon's escape from Cloud City and the Empire, Vader had his death trooper guard meet him in a hangar so that he could undertake a quest to find all of the individuals who hid his son, Luke Skywalker, from him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The three death troopers then accompanied Vader in a Lamdba-class shuttle to Tatooine to the Lars moisture farm. After landing at an Imperial base and being met by the local Imperial force and Lieutenant Ardo Banch, Vader ignored the lieutenant's greetings while the death troopers menacingly rebuffed Banch's attempts to speak with Lord Vader. After arriving at the moisture farm, the death troopers provided security while Vader and his crime scene analysis droid ZED-6-7 searched the area for clues. Although with the lack of progress and not being able to find anyone to unleash his anger, Lieutenant Banch and several stormtroopers arrived in a speeder to inform Vader that they picked up several transmissions, but were killed in an explosion. The blast engulfed Vader but unfazed him, and soon found three starships overhead. Using the Force, Vader brought down the larger ship of the trio and killed its occupants after they opened fire. The death troopers nearby moved in atop a sand dune as the other two vessels were shot down. After the skirmish against the criminals, the death trooper guard then traveled with Vader to Coruscant and secured Padm\u00e9's Apartment while Vader and his droid investigated the building."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
