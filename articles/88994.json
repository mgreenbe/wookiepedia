Alongside Zeta and Theta it confronted the strike team sent to Zadd to halt Mentor's plans for droid revolution.

In spite of this tactic, it was destroyed by the strike team."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Beta did not have an independent consciousness at the time it was destroyed by the strike team, rather it was controlled by a portion of Mentor's awareness.
