Due to the fort's importance, Dassyne increased its defensive artillery. Along with the defensive emplacements, a number of B1-Series battle droids stood guard within the structure.

The structure's walls were ray-shielded. Since the planet Bomis Koori IV was important to the Corporate Alliance, as it was described to be the fulcrum of its defense of surrounding star systems, Dassyne increased the structure's defensive arsenal. As a result of the weapons buildup, laser cannon emplacements were present throughout the facade of the structure. The cocky General believed that the structure itself was impenetrable and imagined that it would take an army of Jedi to capture it.

During his time in the fort, Dassyne's military style changed. Instead of relying on clever strategy, he wanted to spend all his efforts on fortifying his stronghold with more weaponry. However, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker initiated an attack on Bomis Koori IV. Despite Dassyne's belief that his fort was Jedi-resistant, both Kenobi and Skywalker infiltrated Dassyne's base and deactivated the ray shield protecting the fort, rendering it vulnerable to the Republic's orbital bombardment of the world and direct strikes from ground forces. Dassyne was killed during the attack, and the Republic later won the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fort first appeared in the twenty-second chapter of the Star Wars: Clone Wars television series, which aired on March 22, 2005.
