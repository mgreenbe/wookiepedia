Rebel players who requested Tier 7 Duty Missions from certain space stations had a chance to battle an elite Imperial pilot during the mission's boss stage. One of these pilots could be Rashon. All of the elite Imperial pilots, Rashon included, had shared quotes randomly generated during the battle. If the player defeated her, she was not destroyed.
