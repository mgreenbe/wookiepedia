By 3643 BBY, Garn was working part-time for the criminal organization known as the Migrant Merchants' Guild on the Republic capital planet of Coruscant, but he also freelanced for other organizations. Garn had been successful enough to draw the attention of the Coruscant Security Force, who maintained a case file #1142-235-3721 on the Rodian and offered a reward for his arrest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That same year, the Sith Lord Tarnis\u2014who was masquerading as a Republic scientist named Eli Tarnis\u2014hired the Black Sun criminal syndicate to steal the design files for the Planet Prison, his own superweapon project. While the Guild and Black Sun were rivals, Black Sun gave the job to Garn, who worked with a Guild team to infiltrate a Republic warehouse. Garn and his team\u2014which consisted of two Rodian thieves, three Ongree slicers, and an Abyssin guard\u2014sliced into the building's computer network, stole the files, and escaped with a shipment of munitions, weapons, and rockets, but not before Garn was seen briefly by a security camera.

As soon as the slicer finished, Garn secretly sent a copy to his employers in Black Sun. However, the Republic Strategic Information Service had identified Garn on a security recording, and the former apprentice of Jedi Master Orgus Din was sent to recover both the files and the stolen weapons. The Jedi Knight and the Jedi's companion, the astromech droid T7-O1, stormed the warehouse and defeated the Guild members. Upon realizing the warehouse was under attack, Garn sealed himself inside the warehouse's secure room. Recovering the weapons, the Knight cut open the security door and confronted the criminal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Realizing that his enemy was a Jedi, Garn apologized and activated a quartet of autoturrets in an attempt to kill the Knight and T7. However, the pair were able to disable the turrets and disarm the Rodian without much trouble, and Garn quickly surrendered. Learning that the Knight was searching for the design files, he freely gave them to the Jedi and offered to give up the names and locations of his employers if the Knight would allow him to leave. The Jedi agreed, and let the Rodian depart in peace after learning that he had been hired by Black Sun. Thanking the Jedi and the droid, Garn told them that he planned to go stay with friends on the Smuggler's Moon of Nar Shaddaa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vistis Garn was a purple-eyed Rodian male with bluish-purple skin. An accomplished thief who spoke Rodese, he worked for the highest bidder, and was never completely loyal to one side. He was more than willing to work for competing parties, evident when he worked for both the Migrant Merchants' Guild and their rival, Black Sun. Despite being a criminal, Garn also respected the Jedi, and was willing to accept mercy when it was offered, although this was because he was afraid after being defeated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vistis Garn was created for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released by BioWare on December 20, 2011.
