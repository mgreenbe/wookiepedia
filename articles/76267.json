Dosun trained the Jedi Padawan Kosa-Yin Hadu, a fellow Gungan. The pair disappeared c. 33 BBY while on a mission from the Jedi Temple on the planet Coruscant. Hadu later emerged about two years later as a Dark Jedi. This prompted the Jedi Master Seenlu Kir to investigate the nature of the Gungans' mission to discover where Hadu and Dosun had been lost. However, her inquiries were unsuccessful, and she was unable to learn anything new about their disappearance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kin-Ya Dosun was mentioned in The Kaluthin Are Always Greener, a role-playing supplement that was written by Adam Burns.
