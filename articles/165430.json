Originally designed to function in groups of fifty aboard bank-courier repulsor trucks of Aargau, the engines utilized a series of thrust ducts to feed pressurized air through the speeder to propel it through atmospheres. The yellow speeder was docked at a parking bay balcony several floors below Padm\u00e9 Amidala's apartment on Coruscant in 22 BBY, and was stolen by Anakin Skywalker to pursue the assassin Zam Wesell after she attempted to kill Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala. Considering the open-top speeder to be the fastest in the parking bay, Skywalker hotwired Greyshade's vehicle and chased Wesell through the Coruscant skylanes. Obi-Wan Kenobi ultimately landed the speeder outside the Outlander Club in Vos Gesal Street, and it was later recovered and returned to its designated parkslot. Senator Greyshade was left unable to press charges, and the official inquiry into the vehicle's theft was cut short."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
