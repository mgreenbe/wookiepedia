Under the command of Captain Dal and the ship's chief medical officer Doctor Senessa, the Daybreaker traveled to the Uphrades system around 3643 BBY in order to deliver shipments of medical supplies, but arrived in the system just as the Imperial warship Oppressor attacked the agriworld of Uphrades with the Desolator superweapon. The ship's commander, the Sith Lord Darth Angral, dispatched boarding pods to destroy the medical frigate while the Oppressor departed the system, and the Daybreaker's military complement were unsuccessful in preventing the boarding."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, a Jedi Knight and crew arrived in the system not long after the Oppressor departed, and Captain Dal's emergency broadcast drew the Knight to the frigate. With the Jedi's help, the crew were able to defeat the Imperial boarders, and Doctor Senessa assumed command of the ship when Captain Dal refused to aid the survivors on Uphrades' surface. The Daybreaker was intentionally stranded on Uphrades so that its crew could help those left on the surface to survive long enough for Republic aid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
