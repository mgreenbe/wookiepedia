However, there is no evidence to suggest that Distombe ever appeared in the game, suggesting that he was merely one of many other NPCs cut from actual inclusion on the live servers. Nonetheless, an emulated depiction of Distombe reveals what he would have looked like, had he been included. The tree files also point to him being a member of the Sith Shadows, a group of thugs which would attack the village of Aurilia on Dathomir."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
