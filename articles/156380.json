Everyone present disguised themselves as farmers during the negotiations, and the brown-haired female joined several other Knights in pretending to tend to a field close to the talks.

In that year, a large group of Knights that included the brown-haired female served as bodyguards to Fel as he traveled to the planet Agamar. The Emperor was rendezvousing on the planet's surface with representatives of the Jedi Order; the Jedi and Fel had a common enemy in Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire, and both parties hoped to forge an alliance directed against Krayt's forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the morning of the peace talks, every Jedi and Imperial Knight disguised themselves as Agamarian farmers, and the brown-haired female joined several other Knights in pretending to tend to a field near to the negotiations. While they exercised their deception, Fel and several Imperial Knight Masters met with four Jedi representatives, led by the Jedi Master K'Kruhk. An agreement was reached, but the meeting was interrupted immediately thereafter by Nyna Calixte\u2014the Director of Imperial Intelligence for Krayt's Empire\u2014who was secretly aiding Fel. She rode a local beast into the field where the brown-haired female was stationed, but after two Imperial Knights fired blaster rifles at the animal, she collapsed onto the ground. Calixte hurriedly told the two groups that Krayt's Sith were aware of their meeting and had sent a task force to capture or kill the Emperor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Sith strike team then rose from some nearby swamps, and Antares Draco, the leader of the Imperial Knights, called on his Knights to defend the Emperor.

The Jedi joined their new allies in fighting off the attacking Sith and protecting the Emperor, and the combat saw at least ten Sith fall to the blades of Jedi and Imperial Knights, as well as to Calixte's blaster. Some Jedi and Imperial Knights were slain as well, but most of the survivors, including the Emperor, managed to evacuate the fray on the escape shuttle Defender One."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The brown-haired female was a member of the Imperial Knights, an organization that was dedicated to protecting the Emperor and preserving his Empire.
