These unusual beings were responsible for translating and bargaining with the masters of the Gree Enclave on behalf of their alien clients. This meant that they generally assisted visitors to the Enclave and acted as guides. They were highly rare amongst the Gree though they often clustered in starports that were open to alien space travelers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Such individuals charged high prices for their services but they served as the only means for outsiders to interact with the masters. The involvement of a severak was able to considerably cut the costs of dealing with a Gree master and made a journey to the Enclave much more safer, profitable as well as interesting for alien outsiders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
