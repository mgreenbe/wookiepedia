They had mauve-colored skin, no hair, and to all outward appearances, no distinct gender either. Drivoks could speak Basic, but seemed to have limited grasp of the syntax, often omitting articles from their speech. Drivoks had the ability to sense others, and therefore some Drivoks were employed as trackers and bounty hunters. In 21 BBY, Colonel Barev employed a Drivok bounty hunter to locate Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi for General Lok Durd.This Drivok was able to sense Obi-wan psychically and locate him on a world map. Obi-wan sensed this detection in the Force but was unable to recognize it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
