In about 18 BBY, the Jedi Knight Jax Pavan confronted Xizor and the Black Sun lieutenant Tyno Fabris inside Fabris' office in the Oyu'baat tapcafe on the planet Mandalore, after Xizor reneged on a deal to have Black Sun transport Pavan to Kantaros Station in the Both system. Xizor instructed Brank to stand guard, to forestall any possible attacks by Pavan. Xizor soon had his forces turn on Pavan, and the Falleen ordered Brank to defend him from the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
