It was advertised as glitch-proof, and was heavily hyped, but failed miserably. Although it handled simple tasks with ease, it was unable to handle excessive stimuli, such as bells or flashing lights, constantly malfunctioning. Genentech quickly responded to complaints and recalled as many of these droids as possible. These recalled droids were given programming patches, and operated almost perfectly. It wasn't enough, however, as the droid was discontinued after two years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Holographic Zoo for Extinct Animals on Coruscant used a PIP/2 to control holographic dioramas, as well as for keeping visitors moving through the exhibit halls. Unfortunately for the droid, it had an 'unpleasant' encounter with an enraged Wookiee, Chewbacca."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
