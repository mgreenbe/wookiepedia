According to Ewok legend, in the years before the coming of the Golden One, the population of Endor lived difficult lives in a darkness without balance. In this time, Ewok elders saw in visions that a light would come to banish the darkness. To this end, they encouraged the Ewoks to live with tolerance and kindness, uniting the tribes together. Their virtue was rewarded a being so bright came to Endor that he lit up the entire moon. The Ewoks named the being the Golden One, because his presence was so bright that none could look directly at him. After the Golden One's coming, trees grew on Endor and the Ewoks left the caves that they resided in to construct towns in the new forest. Their civilization flourished and developed art and discourse."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the Golden One knew that there must be balance, and darkness in places he could not reach would seek to reassert its power.

Although the Ewoks wept, he withdrew to the sky, and the moon experienced a constant cycle of day and night.

During the mission, the droid and his companions, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, and R2-D2, encountered a group of Ewoks of the Bright Tree Village, who believed he was the Golden One returned to Endor due to the color of his plating. Rejoicing his arrival, the Ewoks resolved to sacrifice C-3PO's companions and placed him on a throne. Although reluctant to impersonate a deity, he attempted to persuade the Ewoks to free his friends at the urging of Solo and Princess Leia Organa, who had befriended the village. When C-3PO's attempts failed, the Jedi Knight Skywalker used the Force to levitate the protocol droid in his throne. Fearing the anger of their deity, the Ewoks quickly released the prisoners. That evening, C-3PO persuaded them to join him in the fight against the Empire and, with the aid of the Ewok warriors, the rebels triumphed in the battle and the Imperial invaders left Endor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The exploits of C-3PO on Endor were eventually incorporated into the Ewok's legends about the Golden One.

He again descended to Endor, accompanied by companions, and his return restored their faith and, after performing feats of magic, the Golden One explained to the Ewoks the true extent of the danger their enemy posed. Returning to arms for the first time in generations, the Ewoks joined with the Golden One and his companions to go to war against the agents of darkness.
