Around 3900 BBY, the Republic explorer Kwilaan, discovered the planet Naboo with a fleet of three starships. Groups of Human refugees fleeing a civil war on Grizmallt, led by none other than Kwilaan, settled in the mountains and great grass plains of Naboo. The settlers established various city-states, which were in a constant struggle with each other. Additionnally, the colonists clashed with the amphibious Gungans, who were native to the planet. In that time of conflict, the Grizmalltian\u2014who had become the Naboo\u2014eventually appointed one woman their leader. She accepted the position and title of Queen, but refused to start a hereditary dynasty, decreeing that her people would elect the wisest among them after her death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the early establishment of a meritocratic democracy, the Naboo did shift to a dynastic system.
