One of the few Human settlements found in that region of the planet, K'avor was destroyed by a Imperial anti-matter bomb in 3 ABY. The blast completely laid waste to the city, and a runaway Cherenkov effect caused its ruins to shine with radioactive blue flame. However, not all of K'avor's population were killed in the bombing. One K'avor native, Lobar Aybock, was instead captured by the Empire, which sold him to Zygerrian slavers after he was ruled unfit for stormtrooper training. After attaining his freedom, Aybock later became a champion shockboxer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "K'avor first appeared in Star Wars 53: The Last Gift from Alderaan, written by Chris Claremont and released in 1981."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
