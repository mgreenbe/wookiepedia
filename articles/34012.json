During the war, Darbin was utterly ambitious and when he was approached by agents of Imperial Intelligence, they secretly recruited him, promising the post of prime minister once the Imperials seized power. Likewise, the Empire soon had the entire Corellian Council in its pocket and send troops on the planet. However much to Darbin's surprise, many Corellian groups and common citizens put up a stiff resistance against the Sith Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darbin Sull had a mother whose face he claimed to be familiar with.

Sull was to serve a role of the hero's \"prisoner\", who was to \"escape\" and infiltrate the Republic. The hero also decided to give Sull a slight bruise to make the deception look convincing. Unfortunately for Sull, the Republic suspected him of being an Imperial spy, so to get into their good graces, he informed them of the Imperials attempting to kill Jedi Master Corin Tok. He managed to warn the hero before the ambush, but was reprimanded for the slip-up."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The final area for the Empire to capture was Capitol Square of the Coronet City, where the Green Jedi were the last form of resistance and had sealed themselves within the Green Jedi Enclave. Sull had managed to acquire one access code for the hero to enter, but couldn't grab another without blowing his cover. He informed his allies that all but one Green Jedi have sought haven in the enclave, except for Master Bedoch, who was trying to hold Republic Foundation Museum. The hero sacked the museum and killed Bedoch, taking his access code."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once all the pieces were in place to take the Green Jedi out, Sull charmed his way into the enclave to distract the Green Jedi Council. As the hero made the way inside, Sull offered to distract the Jedi, even though he'd be blowing his cover, which his allies approved. Once the Green Jedi were all killed, the hero and Darbin Sull reported to Darth Decimus of their success. Sull tried reminding the Dark Councilor of their prior agreement to give him the post of the Prime Minister. Decimus admitted that he could imagine Corellia rebuilding under Sull's leadership, however, he felt that rebellion would only rise again if that came to pass. Agreeing with the Sith Lord, the Imperial hero decided to kill Sull and struck him down just as his dreams were closest to being realized."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The player can choose whether to kill Sull or spare him.

The player can choose to kill Jalta (dark side option) or spare him (light side option)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If Sull is spared, he will appear during the bounty hunter storyline.
