Tuyll was drinking at the castle's bar when Kanata, who was returning a tray of drinks to the bar beside Tuyll, recognized the smuggler Han Solo entering the establishment and cried out to him across the castle, silencing everyone present for a moment. Shortly after Solo's arrival, many of the castle's occupants were drawn outside to view the destruction of the Hosnian system by the First Order's Starkiller Base superweapon. The First Order then attacked and destroyed Kanata's castle. While at the castle, Tuyll wore black boots and brown clothing, including a pair of gloves and a cap. His left eye was covered by an eye patch and he had fair skin and brown hair."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wi'ba Tuyll was created for the film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in North America on December 18, 2015.
