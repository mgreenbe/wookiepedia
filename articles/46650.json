One of the first hundred clone commanders put through Alpha-17's specialized training regimen, Faie's by-the-book personality often put him at odds with his Jedi superiors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Clone Wars reached its finale, Faie was chosen to lead one of three elite corps, with the other two being led by Commanders Neyo and Bly, set aside for action on Saleucami, where they were to take out Separatist cloning facilities being used to churn out deadly Morgukai warriors. The task force was placed under the command of Jedi Generals Oppo Rancisis and Quinlan Vos. As the battle against Saleucami's Morgukai defenders raged, Republic capital ships pounded the clone facilities into dust. Their victory on Saleucami was undercut, however, with the death of General Rancisis at the hands of the Dark Jedi Sora Bulq."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following his success on Saleucami, Faie was once again paired with Jedi General Quinlan Vos and sent to the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk as part of an elite task force helmed by Jedi Master Yoda and Commander Gree of the 41st Elite Corps."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Separatists moved against the city of Kachirho, Faie, Gree, and the Jedi were there to meet them. As the fighting for the city intensified, both Gree and Faie received Order 66 directly from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Acting without hesitation, Faie and his clone troops moved against Generals Vos and Unduli before they could catch wind of what was going on, though Vos escaped with his life. However, Commander Gree did not fare as well, as he was decapitated when he tried to sneak up on General Yoda. With the death of Gree, the burden of orchestrating the defense of Kashyyyk, as well as hunting down the surviving Jedi, fell upon Faie's shoulders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Faie's search for the fugitive Vos took him and the clone troopers of Bogey Squad deep into the heart of Kashyyyk's thick forests, where he demanded that Vos reveal himself and face justice, or Faie would call in an orbital bombardment that would destroy himself, the Jedi and a nearby village of innocent Wookiees. Enraged that the clone would deliberately endanger innocents just to fulfill one objective, Vos leapt from the trees, lightsaber at the ready. Though Faie did manage to shoot the Jedi in the chest, the shot wasn't fatal. Vos beheaded the clone commander with a single stroke of his weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Commander Faie was the ideal clone that was envisioned by the cloners on Kamino and embodied by the vast majority of the Clone Army. Unlike some of his brethren, he showed little interest in developing himself as an individual and strictly maintained himself as\u2014what all clones were created to be\u2014a soldier bred to fight and die for the Republic. He followed orders without question, regardless of what they were. Faie's obedience was so extreme to the point where that held little to regard for his life or that of others. For instance, he was perfectly willing to kill himself and an entire Wookiee village via orbital bombardment just to fulfill Order 66 in eliminating his former superior officer, General Vos. He disliked the Jedi Order and did not hesitate to murder Jedi Master Luminara Unduli in compliance with Order 66, shooting her in the chest before she could defend herself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Faie was known to wear three sets of armor during his service\u2014a set similar to a Clone engineer, a panoply with white plates and yellow markings like those of the 327th Star Corps, and the garb of a clone scout trooper."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Faie was named after Art Department Supervisor Fay David."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
