Along with his Padawan Yaddle, Master Kut battled Tulak's Advozsec legions on a bridge overlooking the Koban Gorge, but the Jedi Master was defeated as insurmountable numbers of the enemy swarmed and killed him. Yaddle was subsequently taken captive and spent the next one hundred years as Tulak's prisoner."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
