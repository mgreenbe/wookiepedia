Composed of BTL Y-wing starfighters, it saw combat in the Airam sector where it was assigned to the Mon Calamari MC80 cruiser Crucible. When the Crucible was sent to rescue factory personnel in the Mobetta system from an Imperial attack, Blood Squadron went with it. Upon arrival, the unit was given the task of driving away, or at least warding off, the Imperials' command ship, the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Rage. However, despite escort by Sundancer Squadron in its Z-95 Headhunters, it was destroyed together with the factory and Crucible."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
