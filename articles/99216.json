That parka was in fact of ancient make and had been passed down from generation to generation of Jedi before it befell to Kenobi. Lined with woven metallic fibers, that quilted Jedi suit kept its wearer warm in frigid condition while also protecting them from blows. Kenobi notably wore that parka when he was sent by the Jedi High Council to investigate the tundra of Ando Prime in search of a Force nexus. He wore it with a pair of custom-fitted ice boots with talon-like metal crampons and a pair of tinted goggles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
