It was equipped with a single forward laser cannon and a single chute capable of deploying proton bombs. It could be distinguished from other Y-wing models by the lack of extended thrust vectral struts on its ion engines, and was used primarily by smaller Rebel cells for attacking surface targets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
