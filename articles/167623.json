Emon Azzameen mentioned that his father gave him a swig when he was a child, so he could get some hair on his chest. As he put it, it put hair on his chest, legs, arms, and every other part of his body. Zairona Ale might have been sold aboard the casino/resort space station, the Dunari's Rest, as its drinking chit showed a drink on it that was similar in appearance to the illegal alcoholic drink."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
