A clone trooper pilot, Tracer was part of the Republic Navy's Hunter Squadron of BTL-B Y-wing starfighters and was assigned to Jedi Master Plo Koon. Around 22 BBY, the Republic suffered a series of major defeats in space battles in the Mid Rim, largely due to the Separatists having four times as many ships as the Republic Navy. To combat this, the Republic decided to smuggle a team of Jedi and clone troopers to the Banking Clan shipyards at Gwori in order to obtain the exact coordinates of the shipyards and conduct an assault. After the team successfully landed, they captured a Separatist comm tower. From the tower, Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano reported the coordinates to the Republic task force under the command of Jedi Generals Koon and Saesee Tiin, and Admiral Wullf Yularen in the Moskk system, where Hunter Squadron had been stationed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Tracer and fellow pilot Warthog made a bet about the outcome of the mission, Koon and Tiin began to brief Hunter Squadron about the upcoming attack aboard a Venator-class Star Destroyer, informing them that the shipyards were in a system of canyons on the planet and that they would have to destroy them with the proton cannons on their Y-wing bombers. At the behest of Tracer's captain, Tiin revealed that they would be making an exact hyperspace jump between the Separatist blockade of Gwori and the planet itself, and Koon further explained that the risk of the jump was worth it, because it would save the lives of countless clones and millions of beings. After the briefing, Warthog asked Tracer to rethink his bet. Shortly after, Hunter Squadron in their Y-wings, along with the Jedi Masters in their starfighters, prepared to jump, and Koon ordered them to make sure their navicomputers were all synchronized, since if they were slightly off, they would come out before the blockade or inside the planet. Once all was ready, Tracer, serving as the gunner of Warthog's bomber, and Hunter Squadron jumped to hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Attack on Gwori"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After successfully exiting hyperspace between the blockade and Gwori, Koon contacted the squadron and ordered them to focus on their objective. Approaching the canyons of Gwori, Tiin and Koon destroyed the anti-air turrets on the ground.

Koon then ordered the squadron to assume Bantha formation and target the construction supports. On the way there, the squadron was attacked by Vulture droids, which Tracer opened fire on. Although he managed to destroy several droids, he was soon hit by a laser bolt in the chest. The squadron proceeded to bomb and destroy the construction supports, resulting in the destruction of the shipyards.
