The force made use of artillery and a number of starships in their defense, but could not damage the C-9979 landing craft that the Separatists were using due to a shield protecting the vehicles. The shield did not prevent the Separatists firing on the defense force however, and their fire began reducing their numbers. A sergeant serving in the defense force complained of the issue to Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who had been sent by the Republic to help in the battle, and the pair of Jedi then used jet-wings vehicles to penetrate the shields and destroy the lead Separatist craft, which was generating the shield. With the shield down the Jedi then let the defense forces finish off the vulnerable Separatists left."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The force first appeared in Inside Job a comic written by Rik Hoskin and illustrated by Andres Ponce, which was published in 2009 in issue 6.1 of of the Star Wars Comic UK magazine series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
