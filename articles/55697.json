They had green skin, lacked hair, had few teeth, and hopped around to move. Their eyes were dark green, surrounded by yellow sclera. Gorphs were about 2 meters in height, had three fingers and toes, tails, and huge chins with three green dots. When hopping, they made a squishy noise."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Living in a grotto, Gorph society was tribal, and led by a queen. Sitting atop a throne, if the queen disapproved of someone, they were cast into a dark hole in her audience chamber known as the Pit.

She looked for princesses from their homeworld of Endor to marry her son, Prince Vork, in an attempt to unite different tribes, with herself as ruler. Two sets of Gorphs returned first with the princess of the Mudgub tribe, and then the princess of the Titterbug tribe. Though Prince Vork was attracted to both, the queen disapproved and ordered the princesses to be cast into the pit. The queen then turned to the Ewoks, seeing an opportunity to unite the two tribes. She sent out Gorphs to capture the Ewok princess. Two Gorphs then found a group of Ewoks. The Gorphs believed that Latara was a princess and would please Queen Slugga. When the two Gorphs returned with Latara, who was pretending to be a princess for the day, Latara stated that she wasn't the real princess. This angered Slugga who used her tongue to hang Latara over the pit. Before being dropped in however, Latara lied, telling Slugga that she actually was the real princess. Slugga commenced the wedding, in spite of Latara's continued protestations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After finding a piece of Latara's hood, her Ewok friend Wicket noticed Gorph tracks heading to the grotto. Wicket, the real Ewok princess Kneesaa, and Teebo went to rescue her, arriving just as the wedding began. Hearing noises, two Gorphs went out to investigate, causing the Ewoks to hide. After finding nothing, the Gorphs headed back to the wedding. The Ewoks overlooked the wedding and began planning on how to save Latara, when they again got caught by guards, but Wicket tackled a Gorph while Kneesa stepped on the foot of the Gorph holding her. This caused the Gorphs to jump in pain, allowing the Ewoks to escape. Heading to the queen's audience chamber, the group rescued Latara, running down a hall to escape. Slugga, Vork, and two Gorphs began chase of the Ewoks. After the Ewoks failed to climb a slippery ramp, the Gorphs were getting ever so closer when Wicket took Kneesaa's crown and threw it, sending Slugga, Vork, and two other Gorphs into a spiral. The spiral of Gorphs rolled into Slugga's audience chamber, eventually sending the Gorphs into their own pit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gorphs first appeared in \"Princess Latara,\" the fourth episode in the second season of the animated television series Ewoks.
