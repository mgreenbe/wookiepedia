This rack extended out from the face of the MTT, allowing the droids to be deployed directly into combat if needed. The MTT's control room was staffed by a OOM pilot battle droid and a droid gunner/engineer. It was armed with only a quartet of 17kv anti-personnel blaster cannons mounted in ball turrets. A single turret was accurate and powerful enough to target and destroy a starfighter in atmospheric combat."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Ostracoda-class Gunboat"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ostracoda-class gunboat was a sea-going vessel designed by Baktoid Armor Workshop for the Trade Federation. The gunboat boasted a rotating anti-aircraft laser turret and two twin laser cannons, as well as an energy bomb launcher.

It was designed by Baktoid Armor Workshop. Each STAP was piloted by a single battle droid that stood on a long foot panel, gripping a pair of handles that controlled its weapons and were used to pilot the craft. STAPs utilized by the Trade Federation prior to the Clone Wars tended to be brown in color; Separatist STAPs were predominantly blue with white triangular markings."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Armored Assault Tank"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Armored Assault Tank, or AAT, was formidable; it was augmented with heavy inches-thick frontal armor that allowed it to plough through walls, and had heavy weaponry. It carried a payload of 55 shells, but once it ran out, the AAT had to return to its carrier to have its bottom section completely replaced, fully recharging its supply. Its crew consisted of four battle droids (one commander, one pilot, and two gunners), and could also carry six B1 battle droids on the hand grips on the outside of the tank The commander typically sat inside the turret of the primary blaster cannon, while the gunners and pilot were positioned in the main hull of the tank. The gunners operated both secondary blasters, and the commander controlled the main turret. The OOM series commander was essential to the function of the rest of the crew; if the commander was destroyed, the crew would cease functioning, often causing the tank to drift out of control."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Manta Droid Subfighter"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Manta droid subfighter was an aquatic droid fighter craft used by the Trade Federation and later the Confederacy of Independent Systems. It was designed by Haor Chall Engineering, who also constructed the Vulture droid. The sleek torpedo-like droid body was capped in front of a large wedge-shaped diving plane. The forward edge of the plane had an electromotive field, that when merged with repulsorlift-driven supercavitation vectrals incorporated into the subfighter's design, resulted in a very fast and surprisingly maneuverable underwater vessel. The twin barrels recessed in the plane sport laser cannons or torpedo launchers, and a few models even featured articulated barrel assemblies that allow both types of weapons on the same fighter."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Platoon Attack Craft"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Platoon Attack Craft, also known as the battle droid carrier, was a repulsorsled battle droid carrier created by Baktoid Armor Workshop. The troop carrier was piloted by two battle droid pilots. The vehicle's drive unit was adapted from a civilian cargo sled, though it featured a large troop deployment rack behind it. Similar to the deployment racks used in MTTs, the troop carrier's single rack could hold 112 battle droids, folded into their space saving configurations. The Techno Union created a copy of the Trade Federation version for their battle droids."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Mini-Sub"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An aquatic version of the MVR-3 speeder bike, the mini-sub, adapted by the Xi Char cathedral factories, saw action in underwater battles during the Clone Wars.
