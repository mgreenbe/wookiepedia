A variant strain could be found on Naboo. The hydenocks grew only in sandy soils and were considered strange by some. Each hydenock had a distinctive trunk curved in its middle, and both its bark and leaves were a shade of red. The hydenock was often pictured in Alderaanian artwork, and a strong red dye could be obtained by crushing and boiling its bark. The Gungans settlers of Ohma-D'un, who had imported many plants from all over the galaxy, used this tree to make bubble wort. When those trees threatened to become extinct, conservationists launched the \"Save The Hydenock\" campaign."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
