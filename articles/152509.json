In that year, Dominic Raynor, Baron Administrator of the floating mining settlement Cloud City of the planet Bespin, lost his city in a game of sabacc against a professional player, Lando Calrissian. Raynor, believing that Calrissian had cheated, hired the Trandoshan bounty hunter Bossk to capture the gambler dead or alive. Bossk knew that Calrissian, the new Baron Administrator, would be well protected, so he brought along some mercenaries and cutthroats, including the Duros, a Twi'lek scoundrel, another Twi'lek of the same profession, and a Quarren assassin. The Trandoshan hoped that his team could deal with any problems that might arise during the hunt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Duros and his companions slipped through the security of Cloud City and set up a trap to capture Calrissian in a lower maintenance level of the city. Bossk lured the Baron Administrator into the trap by alerting him in the name of the city's chief engineer. The Trandoshan sent a fake emergency call through the city's communication system and reported to Calrissian that a primary repulsorlift pod of the city would break down and destroy the floating settlement. In response, Calrissian went to the maintenance level; however, he took his Twi'lek bodyguard and four Bespin Wing Guards along as a precautionary measure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bossk was unsure of which turbolift Calrissian would arrive in, so he ordered the Duros and the others to spread into every room near the lifts. The Trandoshan also ordered the members of the team to lure Calrissian out by remaining in sight, while Bossk was hiding and waiting for the right moment to attack. When Calrissian's group entered the maintenance level, a blast door suddenly shut behind them, and the Duros and his companions opened blaster fire on Calrissian's escorts, who decided to hold their enemies off while the Baron Administrator escaped through a nearby hangar. However, a member of Calrissian's party sent a distress call to another quartet of Wing Guards. After the reinforcements had arrived, the Baron Administrator managed to flee the ambush through the hangar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Duros appeared in Sore Loser's Revenge, a Wizards.com online scenario written by Eric Cagle for the Star Wars Miniatures collectible tabletop strategy game in 2004.
