It was in part through his efforts for the Alliance that the Death Star plans were retrieved by Princess Leia Organa following their recovery on the planet Scarif following the Battle of Scarif in 0 BBY. After the plans were used to destroy the Death Star during the Battle of Yavin, he played an integral part in the planning and establishment of Echo Base, the Alliance's headquarters on the icy planet Hoth, and was personally selected to head up its construction, in which he proved instrumental. It took eighteen months to construct the base, two of which were simply installing equipment.
