The base was hidden among the asteroids in the ring of a gas giant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon entering the asteroid belt, Daala's Star Destroyers were trapped by proximity mines that quickly destroyed two destroyers and severely damaged another.

She personally took command of her ship's weapon systems and fired a concentrated ion bolt at Harrsk's destroyer, the Whirlwind, paralyzing it and preventing Harrsk from continuing his assault against Teradoc. With a blaster aimed at a shocked and angry bridge crew, Daala pulled the Firestorm closer to the Whirlwind and activated the time-delayed self destruct system of the Firestorm. Daala told Harrsk that she would destroy her ship and his if he did not order a cessation of hostilities, wishing to force the two warlords to cooperate. As the countdown continued, Daala was contacted by the head of the Crimson Command, Vice Admiral Gilad Pellaeon, who desired to speak to Daala in person. Daala accepted and allowed Pellaeon onto her ship. Shortly after, Harrsk ordered a cessation of hostilities, as he was convinced that Daala was not bluffing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Firestorm, escorted by two of Pellaeon's red Star Destroyers, jumped to a secluded spot in space so that Daala and Pellaeon could have an uninterrupted discussion. Like Daala, Pellaeon believed that the warlords were tearing the Empire apart, and he and Daala agreed to force the 13 most powerful warlords to a negotiating table in order to discuss the future of the Empire. They finally were able to get the warlords to congregate at Tsoss Beacon. Though she attempted to motivate the Imperial warlords to fight together and crush the New Republic, they spent hours arguing instead, refusing to agree on anything. After hours of petty squabbling, Daala decided that the negotiations were a failure and she executed the warlords by sealing the room and filling the chamber with gas"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the warlords out of the way, Daala set about uniting their now-leaderless Imperial forces. Daala visited the fortress of warlord Delvardus and his second-in-command, Colonel Cronus, agreed to join Daala, handing her control of Delvardus' Super Star Destroyer, the Night Hammer. With the Night Hammer under her command, Daala quickly rallied the scattered remnants of the Empire under herself and Pellaeon as to prepare a full-on assault against the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Essential Atlas identified Teradoc's capital world as Hakassi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
