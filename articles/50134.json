During the Clone Wars it had been neutral, but in 21 BBY elite Confederacy of Independent Systems agents had established a training camp on the world and disturbed the settlers. The settlers complained to the Galactic Senate, who dispatched Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker to the planet in 20 BBY to covertly aide the settlers, without letting either side know the Jedi were present.
