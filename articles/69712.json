While at Fort Garnik, Jaynes and the other Republic troops stationed there fought in the Separatist War against a group of Separatists attempting to take control of Ord Mantell.

While on the planet, Jaynes received training from Lieutenant Forris and other instructors at a combat instructor academy located in the fort, which Jaynes credited as saving him during combat situations.
