It was also larger and bulkier than contemporary Alliance frigates like the ShaShore-class, due to the increased amount of reactors and power generators needed to feed the weapons-batteries on the three forward blade-structures. The immense power-distribution system was similar to the one on the larger Scythe-class."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In terms of weaponry, the Tri-Scythe-class had less than the Scythe-class, but more than the ShaShore-class. The ship was less maneuverable than the other frigates due to the extra power-support systems adding to the bulk of the craft, and the Tri-Scythe could be outflanked by enemy ships targeting its sides and rear. In addition to more armament, the carried craft complement was also a bit higher than on contemporary frigates."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At least one ship of this type served the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances during the Sith\u2013Imperial War.
