Due to its size, many systems declared this blaster pistol illegal, while others had its usage closely regulated. Other star systems tended to view it as a \"self-defense\" alternative to the other, more powerful personal blaster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Q2 was actually taller than it is long, being only 9.6 cm in length and 10.3 cm in height\u2014from the bottom of the handle to the top of the receiver. A specialized power pack was required, and could be purchased from any authorized Merr-Sonn dealer for twenty credits. This supplied enough energy for six shots. Unlike most handheld blaster weapons, the Q2 fired green blaster bolts, similar to the S-5 heavy blaster pistol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala and her retinue of handmaidens were trained to proficiency with these weapons.
