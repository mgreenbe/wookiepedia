Unfortunately for the Nhoras, when the Empire pulled out, the Clatear found themselves with a well-armed military force. During the Caamas Document crisis, with the New Republic apparently either unwilling or unable to interfere with local conflicts, the Clatear-Nhoras conflict began to heat up once more. The Nhoras hired mercenaries, such as the Dhashaan Shield, the retired pirate Dharus, and possibly the Soskin Guard, to help even the odds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
