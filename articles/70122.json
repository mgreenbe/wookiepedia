Akin to the Jedi Guardians, the Vindicators were tasked with the capture and elimination of Pius Dea-aligned Jedi Knights still active in the galaxy after the final religion's exorcism from Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Abiding by a grey interpretation of the Force, the Vindicator philosophy was deemed heretical by the Jedi High Council in the wake of the siege of Garn, which resulted in thousands of dead Jedi and a public relations catastrophe with the wider galaxy. The surviving Jedi who believed in the cause were exiled and formed the Guild of Vindicators, which persisted as a cult of vigilantes in the dark places of the galaxy for generations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rise of the Vindicators"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A traditionalist school which arose within the Jedi Order during the Pius Dea Era, the Vindicator school of thought was dedicated to the eradication on the Pius Dea religion which had oppressed the galaxy and the Galactic Republic for generations. Sanctioned by the Jedi High Council and tasked with hunting down Jedi dissidents who practiced the outlawed religion, the Vindicators detained any Force-sensitive who violated the laws of the Republic regardless of their affiliation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sending their prisoners to Coruscant to be tried by the Galactic Courts, the Vindicators became frustrated as the beings they captured escaped Republic custody time and time again. Gaining more and more leeway as the High Council sought to limit the public relations fallout from the entire affair, the Vindicators accused Jedi Master Carel Kapekos of releasing the Vindicator's prisoners from their cells due to his Pius Dea faith. Arresting Master Kapekos when he came to Coruscant to clear his name, the Vindicators charged him with sedition and used their abilities to kill the midi-chlorians which allowed Kapekos to touch the Force."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Blinding light of the Jedi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the torture and banishment of Master Kapekos, the Jedi Vindicators had gained a strong reputation and political power over the High Council, but their work drove many Force-sensitives to join Kapekos and the so-called Fallen on Garn. As the Order of the Terrible Glare amassed power on the Outer Rim of the Republic, the Vindicators received Kapekos' deputy, Alquist on Coruscant. Claiming the Kapekos had gone mad with power, Alquist called on the Jedi to intervene, a request the Vindicators could not resist."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rushing to Garn, the Jedi Vindicators ran knowingly into the Order of the Terrible Glare's trap, seeking a bloodletting with the heretical Shamans. Upon arrival on Garn, the Vindicators were horrified at what they found: dark entities from a bizarre and eldritch realm of darkness called the rozzum. Discovering a world covered in great Shadow Domes, great pockets of utter darkness that swallowed the Force's light, the Vindicators of the Jedi Order had found their ultimate enemy in the Shamans of the Terrible Glare. Walking arrogantly into the darkness of the Shadow Domes, countless Jedi Vindicators fell victim to the soul snares bestowed upon the Shamans from the depths of Otherspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As countless Vindicators had their Force essence ripped fro their bodies and imprisoned for eternity in the Shaman's soul snares, the Jedi Order sent a team of Grand Masters to put down the insurrection on Garn before the Republic Senate learned of the debacle erupting on the world. The violence and bloodshed on Garn was categorized as a holocaust by Jedi historians, as thousands of Jedi died in the months-long siege. A pyrrhic victory for the Order, the Shamans' number was reduced to unproblematic numbers, and the Jedi Council deemed them defeated. Because of Grand Master and Supreme Chancellor Biel Ductavis' political acumen, the conflict on Garn was dismissed as anti-Republic propaganda and the Jedi Order quickly eradicated mention of Kapekos' insurgency."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Disbandment and exile"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Garn affair, the Vindicator school's heresy was laid plain before the High Council. Banning the practice of the Vindicator's teachings, the High Council exiled those Jedi who refused to disavow the Vindicator philosophies, believing their obsession with purity had drawn them too far into the grey areas of Force knowledge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fleeing the galactic core, the surviving Vindicators sought refuge on the fringe of the known galaxy, serving as vigilantes on the frontier. While the Jedi High Council did not pursue the exiles, the Vindicators formed a Guild of grey Force-users who embraced a radical philosophy that was neither dark or light."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The lessons of the Jedi Vindicators and the Order of the Terrible Glare were reviewed by Jedi Master Simikarty and presented to the Jedi High Council as a reminder of the august body's past failures and ability to make mistakes. While knowledge of the Garn Conflict was limited to members of the High Council, Master Simikarty argued that adults not be admitted into the Order because of the risks that they bring with them their culture's trite beliefs such as the Pius Dea religion. Simikarty also railed against the roots of the Vindicator school of Jedi teachings, stating that the ability to create a dynasty of authoritarians was too great when Jedi could marry and have children. The fiasco with the Vindicators would lead the era's Council to ban marriages and familial relations between Jedi, as well as the initiation of adult students."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Outside the Jedi High Council's concern, the Guild of Vindicators persisted long after the Pius Dea Crusades, and even outlived the Jedi Order with the rise of the Galactic Empire. The Guild was eventually discovered by the Sith Lords who ruled the galaxy, earning their resentment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
