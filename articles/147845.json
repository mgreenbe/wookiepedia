However, the Profundity was sent to Scarif, where a team of Rebels attempted to steal the plans of the Empire's Death Star battle station. After the Profundity intercepted the rebel transmission of the Death Star plans, the redoubtable Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader boarded the cruiser. Having copied the stolen plans on a datacard, some crewmembers of the Profundity attempted to board the Tantive IV in time. The bearer of the the datacard, however, could not enter the corvette because of a jammed security door. On the other side of the door, Jefkin managed to get ahold of the precious device through a slight opening. Once in possession of the plans, he charged through the corridors of the Profundity until he reached the cruiser's docking bay and the entry hatch to the Tantive IV. The moment Jefkin boarded the corvette, he ordered the ship's launch.
