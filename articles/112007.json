They had a deep voice, larges beaks and pointed wings. Though non-sentient, ravens had high bird intelligence and were perhaps amongst the smartest birds.

Ravens had an all-black plumage with shaggy feathers around the throat, pointed wings and a wedge-shaped tail. Their beak was large, slightly curved downward and heavy. Their eyes were slightly slanted, with dark brown irises. They had two short legs with strong three-clawed toes and a hook-like hind talon. Like all avians, they were warm-blooded creatures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ravens emitted different kinds of sounds varying from a low croak to shrill alarm cries. Depending on the emotional state, those often deep and reverberating calls were known as squawkings or shriekings.
