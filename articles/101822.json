Kuat sought to have him eliminated, as Fett had gained information about a plot by Kuat to frame Prince Xizor of the Black Sun crime syndicate for the deaths of the Jedi Luke Skywalker's aunt and uncle. Many bounty hunters thus began searching for Fett, and Osss-10 was among those who joined the hunt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fett set out for the planet Tatooine on a mission to recover a spy droid that contained evidence of Kuat's effort to frame Xizor. In an attempt to arrive on the desert world unhindered by the bounty hunters searching for him, Fett hired N'dru Suhlak to transport him to Tatooine. Fett and Suhlak arrived in the Tatoo system aboard Suhlak's modified Z-95 Headhunter and set a course for Tatooine. Osss-10 detected the Headhunter using his starship's advanced detection capabilities and scanned Suhlak's ship from a distance, seeking to obtain enough data on its movements to enable him to predict the Headhunter's path and speed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Osss-10 then moved in to attack the Headhunter and opened fire, with his shots striking Suhlak's ship's exterior hull. Suhlak veered his Headhunter off on a different course to evade the bounty hunter, but Osss-10 foresaw Suhlak's move and maneuvered his ship to intercept the Headhunter. With a ruse that Osss-10 had not predicted, Fett took to the controls of Suhlak's vessel and flew toward Osss-10's ship at full speed. Forced to veer off-course in order to avoid a collision, Osss-10 flew his ship at full thrust toward the Headhunter, firing at it with his laser cannon as he passed it and zooming out of range of the Headhunter. Having outsmarted Osss-10, Fett and Suhlak then safely landed on Tatooine, where Fett successfully recovered the spy droid that he sought."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Osss-10 was a skilled bounty hunter who specialized in defeating his opponents by predicting their moves and outsmarting them.
