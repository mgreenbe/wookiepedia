They answered directly to the Office of the Chief of State, and served officially as part of Daala's security detail. Several of the bounty hunters took part in such events as the arrest of Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker, the hunt for the psychotic Jedi Knight Valin Horn, and the raid on the Armand Isard Correctional Facility. After Horn's rampage through Coruscant's business district, the select bounty hunters were mentioned in multiple newscasts as Daala's special-missions force; however, none of them were named. Jedi Knight Jaina Solo conducted research on several of the hunters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among their members were such bounty hunters as Dhidal Nyz, Kaddit, Hrym Mawarr, Vrannin Vaxx, and Zilaash Kuh."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
