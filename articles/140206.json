The Tarc's fiercely isolationist control of their twenty colonized systems led their navy, known as the Ivlacav Gourn, to attack Imperial vessels entering Tarc-controlled space. This led to a number of skirmishes in all of which the Tarc were victorious. The Imperial Moff supposedly in control of the Tarc's region of space was Joss Leskwin and after the several Imperial losses he put together a large force able to confront the Tarc navy. The Iyra xenobiologist Tem Eliss, believed this would drag the species into a full scale short term war with the Empire, a battle the Tarc could not win. Some Tarc on their homeworld of Hjaff spoke of seeking aid from the Rebel Alliance against the Empire, although they had little political power or support."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tarc-Imperial conflict was first mentioned in the West End Games Roleplaying game series of supplement books, the Star Wars Adventure Journals in which it appeared in the fourteenth issue as part of the Alien Encounters article series.
