With death looming over him, Drayen told Risha to take the crown, and take back the throne of Dubrillion for herself. However, if she was to succeed, she would have to do many questionable things, and ordered her to kill the smuggler, whom he deemed irrelevant in the grand scheme of things, thus going back on his original promise.
