The playing field was covered by a thick layer of sand, across which the players (known as chin-bretiers) leaped to reach the opponent's goal. At the start of game play, one side served to their opponent, carrying pikers, to return the serve. The object of Chin-Bret was to score past the goalie (who was designated by a cerulean vest) as many times as possible while keeping the other team from scoring. The goalies carried torch-like devices that stayed lit until the other team scored a goal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
