Most galactic citizens feared them, for it was rumored that they would continue to attack a corpse even after the target was dead and turn against each other in battle when their bloodlust overwhelmed them. The Iridonians were rivals to the Echani and Mandalorian cultures, and members of the species were found on such planets as Manaan during the Jedi Civil War, a period of galactic unrest between 3959 and 3956 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The amnesiac Jedi Knight and former Sith Lord Revan encountered an Iridonian mercenary on Manaan during the war.

They held a traditional rivalry with the near-Human Echani species and with the Mandalorian warrior culture. The Iridonians dismissed the code of honor Echani held dear, while they despised the Mandalorians for prioritizing credits over bloodshed. Iridonian society's bloodlust was reflected by the words of a mercenary of the species, who told the amnesiac Jedi and former Sith Lord Revan that Iridonians did not have friends. That was evident in the eyes of non-Iridonians; one man reported that in the absence of a foe, they would turn on each other for the sheer thrill of bloodshed. They were believed to continue attacking opponents' bodies even after a victim's death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Iridonians manufactured specialized weapons and armor for their own use, although for much of galactic history, those designs were officially outlawed. Such items commanded a premium, costing 1,000 credits more than a typical non-Iridonian example of that item, or 10% more for larger goods."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Iridonians were a rare sight in the civilized galaxy, even during the Jedi Civil War, a conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire beginning in 3959 BBY. By 3956 BBY, both sides in the conflict sought to recruit Iridonians to fight for their respective sides due to their reputation as powerful, if eccentric, warriors\u2014a product of their cultural ethos of savagery. Revan encountered one such Iridonian mercenary on the planet Manaan. That gun-for-hire had been recruited by the Sith to gather youth of the Selkath species, native to the water planet, to the Sith Embassy for training in the ways of the dark side of the Force. Because Iridonian weapons and armor were illegal in much of the galaxy, Iridonians faced discrimination when dealing with members of law enforcement agencies and other government organizations. By the time of the Cold War, Iridonian hearts were traded on the black market by organ harvesters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An \"Iridorian\" appears in the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic video game produced by BioWare in 2003.

It lists a gear template for \"Iridonian Manufacture,\" which describes Iridonians as \"a mysterious species known for their savagery and aggressiveness.\" The gear template gives Iridonian weapons and armor extra resistance to bludgeoning attacks and a bonus to certain attacks that emphasize brute strength. This description matches that of the Manaan Iridorian, but not the pre-existing species known alternatively as both Iridonians and Zabraks, who are said to be a more peaceful species. This change, from \"Iridorian\" to \"Iridonian,\" was confirmed to be deliberate by Rodney Thompson, one of authors of the Campaign Guide, who explained that Lucasfilm Ltd. stipulated the change and that it was \"the KOTOR video game that was in error.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bao-Dur is referred to as an Iridonian in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords by G0-T0."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
