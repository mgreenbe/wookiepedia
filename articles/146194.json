Around 2 ABY, she and Ghia met the newly joined smuggler Han Solo and they fell both in love with the charming ace. Therefore, they were devastated when they heard that Solo was captured by the Empire and delivered to Jabba the Hutt by Boba Fett. Determined to rescue Solo, they stole a snowspeeder and abandoned the Rebellion to rescue him from Jabba, but were captured and enslaved. During their enslavement they were forced to wear Huttese slave-girl costumes. They were also forced to feed and massage him. When Jabba found out that she and her sister were Rebel pilots, he let them fight in his \"Demolition\" games. Now that they were fighting for the Hutt, Jabba appointed Oola as his personal masseuse."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During these Demolition Games, it is unknown what the fate of the twins were.
