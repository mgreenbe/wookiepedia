On Metalorn this system was used in tandem with pulse beat sensors to determine whenever an unauthorized being took hold of a weapon. The system could then track that weapon without error. During the Mission to Metalorn Leia Organa took advantage of this system by abandoning her tracked blaster rifle, misleading her pursuers. While this was embarrassing to Baron Orman Tagge, the system did technically work perfectly."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
