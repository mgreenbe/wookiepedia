Worlds within this category typically produced far more foodstuffs than what could possibly be necessary for its own population (including any immigrant workers); the surplus was then exported to many other worlds that were unable to sustain the food needs of their own population with their own resources. One such planet that benefited from the existence of agriworlds was Coruscant, the capital world of the galaxy as well as other ecumenopoleis, such as Denon and possibly Taris."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chandrila was one such notable agriworld.
