Standing as tall as an average Human male, the bomb was encased in black armor. One end sported a reinforced spike, while the tail had several thrusters attached. During engagements, penetration bombs would be released over a target, dropping to the ground using only inertia. Two seconds before impact, the tail thrusters would fire, driving the bomb underground. Once under the surface, the bombs would detonate, causing concussion shockwaves capable of destroying reinforced bunkers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
