The droids had previously belonged to the Kalarba system's Governor Wena Havid, who flitted across the galaxy in a luxurious starship, but when the governor was bankrupted, most of his possessions were placed on the auction block. The junk trader bought C-3PO and R2-D2 at rock-bottom prices, and the droids were subsequently placed on a freighter bound for the Kalarba system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The freighter also contained a spice shipment belonging to the crooked businessman Olag Greck, as well as the assassin droid IG-88B.
