The Phantom's main jamming unit was a dedicated energy receptor projector, or DERP, capable of absorbing and blocking incoming long-range sensor pings, thus rendering the fighter invisible to most enemy sensors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the fighter was engaged in combat, the jammer would activate its full-spectrum distortion projector to block all scanners and targeting computers by using broadband transmissions to interfere with sensors attempting to target the fighter. The Phantom also contained a row of static discharge panels made for scrambling communications and sub-space frequencies. This allowed the device to not only jam incoming sensor pulses but also to jam a target's outgoing signals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
