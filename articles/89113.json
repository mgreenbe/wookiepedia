The creature's head was armor-plated, and surrounded by eight tentacles used to draw prey into the merdeth's mouth. They were known to consume any organic material they encountered. Merdeths were often accompanied by a swarm of mips, which fed on the ichor found on the merdeth's body, and also helped the creature hunt down and attack prey."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
