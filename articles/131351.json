At a salvage shop, Qui-Gon, Padm\u00e9 (disguised as a commoner), and Jar Jar meet Anakin Skywalker, a young slave boy. Watto, Anakin's master, refuses to sell Qui-Gon the part he needs for Republic credits, and Qui-Gon must somehow raise a sufficient sum of money. As a sudden desert storm approaches, Anakin offers the group refuge at his home.
