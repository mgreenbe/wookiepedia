It served at the Resistance base on the moon Ajan Kloss, where it could often be found underfoot while roaming the undergrowth looking to be productive. The droid quietly tended to low-priority maintenance jobs and crossed them off to-do lists that few ever looked at. In 35 ABY, OC-JK14 was among those in the base who gathered around the body of General Leia Organa to mourn her death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An older model of treadwell style astromech droid that was once popular in the Outer Rim Territories, OC-JK14 was often overlooked by Resistance members, who were drawn to more traditional astromechs. The astromech had a yellow and blue plasteel drum body with a gray multi-spectrum photoreceptor. Its treadwell base had a recessed door to a compartment that contained a variety of tool-tipped manipulators."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "OC-JK14 appeared in the 2019 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, and was first identified in the accompanying reference book Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, written by Pablo Hidalgo.
