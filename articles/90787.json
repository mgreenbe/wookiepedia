Following the abduction of the Togruta colonists from Kiros, she planned to have a slave auction. Scintel then heard that a human in Zygerrian armor, Lars Quell, demanded an audience with her about the demise of Bruno Denturri. She was impressed by his feat and his brash and confident nature. She was given a gift, a slave from Denturri's palace. She spoke with Lars about her plans in expanding her slave empire. Scintel's Twi'lek servant girl then attacked her, but Lars saved her. She watched as the servant girl jumped to her death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Scintel invited Lars to the slave auction. Her Prime Minister, Atai Molec, then informed her of an intruder: Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. She had Kenobi brought before the crowd on the auction block. Scintel gave Lars an electro-whip to teach Kenobi his place. However, Lars revealed himself as Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his slave as Padawan Ahsoka Tano.

Dooku told her that Molec had asked him to come. Scintel told him of her plans to break and enslave the Jedi. Though Dooku saw her plans as ambitious, he told Scintel that he ultimately planned to exterminate the Jedi, not enslave them. Dooku demanded that she let him execute them, but Scintel refused. Molec saw his queen as unworthy to rule and decided to side with Dooku. Scintel then pulled out her electro-whip, but Dooku strangled her through the Force. Dooku released her when Skywalker stormed in and briefly fought Dooku with the queen's electro-whip. When the guards stormed into the room asking about the queen, Dooku claimed that Skywalker had killed her. Skywalker escaped and took Scintel to the Tecora.
