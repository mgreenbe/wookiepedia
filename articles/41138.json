They had broad and elongated bodies, with a relatively long neck and a broad bill. They also had two legs set far back on the body and a pair of short, pointed wings. At least one race of ducks had brown-speckled plumage. They could be seen swimming on the Solleu River, a river that ran through Theed, the capital city of Naboo. Their planet was also home to other waterfowl species, the quadducks and the pelikki."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Ducks in culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As ducks were widespread in the galaxy, they were incorporated in several idiomatic expressions in Galactic Basic Standard, including \"sitting duck.\" The ship known as the Dusty Duck was presumably also named for these animals. However, not all residents of the galaxy were familiar with ducks, especially in some of the provincial regions or on dry, arid planets of the galaxy, like Tatooine. Luke Skywalker curiously asked what a duck was."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ducks were first mentioned in the 1977 novelization of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, which was ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster. They were given an entry in the now-defunct Databank of StarWars.com, which stated that ducks appeared in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. However, the birds seen in that movie were later retconned into pelikki, a related species, in Star Wars: The Phantom Menace: The Expanded Visual Dictionary. Nonetheless, the visual dictionary still mentions the ducks as part of Naboo's wildlife, meaning that the old Databank entry remains valid for the most part."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
