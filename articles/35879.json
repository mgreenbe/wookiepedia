Following the Battle of Yavin, where the Empire lost its Death Star battle station to the Rebel Alliance, the fleet's commander, Admiral Kendal Ozzel, tried to convince Vader to bring Death Squadron to bear immediately to destroy the rebellion. However, Vader rejected this direct approach, agreeing with another of Death Squadron's officers, General Maximilian Veers, in that the Alliance was not suitable for such an extermination. Instead, Vader used his agent, Queen Trios, to infiltrate the rebels' command structure, allowing her to provide the location of their own fleet as it finished completion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Vader's Trios informed him of the Rebels' fleet's location, Death Squadron was sent to attack the Mako-Ta Space Docks.

Vader, angered by Ozzel's incompetence, executed him and and promoted his junior, Captain Firmus Piett, to Fleet Admiral as his replacement. As the Millennium Falcon fled Hoth and entered an asteroid field, Captain Lorth Needa deployed the TIEs of Theta Squadron to patrol the area. The pilots disobeyed orders and entered the field, but did not face retribution for their actions after Needa was executed by Vader for letting their quarry escape."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Failure at Endor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Death Squadron later took part in the Battle of Endor.
