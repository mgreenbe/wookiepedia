However, the 2017 comic Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 1 states that it was destroyed during a celebration of the eradication of the Jedi Order. When asked about this, writer Charles Soule mused that perhaps Yoda built a new one, that he had more than one or that Darth Sidious built a fake to make a point. Lucasfilm Story Group's Matt Martin then stated that they are aware of that but that it isn't an error as Yoda likely had more than a few lightsabers during his lifetime."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
