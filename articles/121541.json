Nicknamed the Protectors by a group of Corellian orphans during the Battle of Corellia in the Galactic War between the Republic and the Sith Empire, the Second Battalion was later deployed on the disaster-stricken planet of Makeb, where they worked to evacuate Makeb's civilians in the face of the world's impending destruction. The Protectors were primarily non-combat, with their ranks staffed by civilians and ex-military volunteers, and they strove to avoid violence and save as many as lives as possible, regardless of whether they were enemies or not."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
