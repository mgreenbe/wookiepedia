Rex is insistent that if they're going to get permission, they should leave immediately, but Anakin says that they need to make time for \"that thing,\" although Rex disagrees. Heading to the barracks, Rex hands Anakin his helmet before staying outside as Anakin goes in. Once in private, Anakin puts the helmet and a holoprojector on the floor and contacts his wife, Padm\u00e9 Amidala. He tells her he is worried that Rex is letting his personal feelings drive him too much on the mission. Padm\u00e9 says she wonders where he might have learned that from, and advises Anakin that he should support Rex's instincts on this mission, since Rex has always done the same for him. Outside, Rex sees Obi-Wan Kenobi approaching and bangs on the door to warn Anakin. Obi-Wan, having already deduced that Anakin is inside the barracks, doesn't believe Rex's hastily thrown-together claim that Anakin is double-checking his gear, without him. When Anakin emerges, he returns Rex's helmet with a claim that the Captain allegedly broke something on it. Obi-Wan has actually come to say that the Jedi High Council has denied permission for the mission, but Anakin talks over him and resolves to go anyways. Resigned, Obi-Wan calls after Anakin \"I hope you at least told Padm\u00e9 I said hello,\" revealing that he knows what Anakin was up to and prompting a brief displeased look from him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In space, Skywalker, Rex and Force 99 prepare for their assault.

After resolving not to terrorize the villagers, the clones move in to rescue Skywalker. They use a boulder to smash several structures and manage to awe the Poletecans by their display of firepower. In the end, the Poletec chief orders a ceasefire and tells the clones that he does not want their war on his planet. The chief also explained that this was the reason he had kidnapped Skywalker. With Tech acting as a translator, Anakin tells the Poletecans that Wat Tambor and his Separatists are responsible for bringing the war to Skako Minor. Rex then tells Tech to tell the Poletecs that he and the clones will apologize for their actions. He also explains that they're here to rescue one of their comrades, Echo, who had fallen into the hands of the Separatists.

Anakin manages to defuse the situation by sending Force 99 to scout out the surroundings while he talks to Rex.

Upon exiting the lift, the clones find themselves facing several D1-series aerial battle droids. Wrecker immediately moves to engage the droids, and as the rest of the Bad Batch follows, Rex quips to Anakin \"So much for stealth!\" Exploring the facility, they lose Echo's signal again.

The viewscreen next to the door activates to reveal Wat Tambor, who informs the clones that he was aware that they were coming and has laid a trap for them. He even used their algorithm to predict every movement they made to infiltrate Skako Minor, thus violating the Techno Union's neutrality.

Echo has been drugged and is completely unaware of his surroundings. Several tubes have been fitted into him and some of his limbs have been replaced by prosthetic parts.

Friedman stated that the \"emotional hook\" of the arc is Rex's relationship with ARC trooper Echo, a character who had been killed in the third season episode \"Counterattack\" but was resurrected for this arc. The setting for the episodes is split between Anaxes, a planet from the Star Wars Legends line, and Skako Minor.

As Rex is keeping watch, Obi-Wan Kenobi arrives, looking for Anakin. Rex tries to cover for his general, who eventually comes out of the barracks. As Skywalker and Rex leave, Kenobi says to his former apprentice: \"I hope you at least told Padm\u00e9 I said hello,\" implying that he knows about his friend's secret.
