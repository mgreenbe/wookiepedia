The two contestants were Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala herself and Bombad General Jar Jar Binks. Grand Master Yoda had sent a skillful Jedi youngling to help the contestants prepare for the race."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The race extended on a great variety of terrains and landforms, going through forests, swamps and mountains in the vicinity of Theed. Despite the racers using different steeds (Amidala rode a tusk cat and Binks a kaadu), this was a fair match. Indeed, the kaadu was better at interacting with swamps and water, while the tusk cat was good at climbing through mountains."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
