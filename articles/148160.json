They were burdened by pirates, and the Defense Force sent a flotilla including a Captor-class heavy munitions cruiser and two Munifex-class cruisers to stop the pirates, obliterating them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their officers wore black, gray, and red uniforms with opalescent stripes. The TDF marines were trained on Balmorra to defend freighters against boarders and to protect them while in port. The bulk of the capital ship assets were corvettes, frigates, and gunships\u2014all of which were fast attack craft intended to drive pirates away from the slower bulk freighters. The fact that it possessed such a fleet disturbed some in the Core Worlds, although the TDF proved that they were effective in a number of early engagements with pirates and raiders, and the Federation also worked closely with the Judicial Forces against bigger threats. One argument against their effectiveness in direct military action, however, was their assets being constantly spread across the galaxy's network of trade routes. However, like its parent organization, it would become more ruthless in exploiting outlying sectors, and later act as the military \"will\" of the Trade Federation, including forcing concessions with backwater systems with their turbolasers, as well as driving away non-Federation transports from ports, and the Kuati and Balmorran traditions faded away as soon as the first Sullustan, Gran, and Neimoidians began taking over key parts of the Federation. The marines were also largely replaced by battle droids, with Lucrehulk-class battleships also increasingly enforcing their policies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Federation's occupation of Naboo, the Defense Force temporarily substituted for the Royal Naboo Security Forces.
