The nebula was the location of the Battle of Kur, in which the Nihil force of Kassav Milliko's Tempest were sent to their deaths against a combined Galactic Republic and Jedi Order fleet by Eye of the Nihil Marchion Ro. Milliko's Tempest was lost during the battle, which Ro hoped would lead the Republic to believe that the Nihil had been eliminated entirely. Jedi Master Jora Malli was killed during the battle, while the Trandoshan Master Sskeer lost an arm. Following the battle, the Jedi Master Avar Kriss noted that Sskeer had not been the same since the events at Kur."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
