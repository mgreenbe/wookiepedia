One example of their use was in Coronet City on Corellia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The C-PH patrol speeder bike was designed to convey power over agility, although it possessed both due to its advanced built-in repulsorlift maneuverability systems. Its sturdy shape was capable of withstanding any high-speed collisions with other vehicles. In addition, it had onboard sophisticated electronics that alerted the driver of any incoming traffic. Unlike other speeder bikes, the C-PH lacked outrigger steering vanes, instead making use of a forward-facing bank of repulsorfield vector guides for maneuvering. Its main armament was a forward fixed BlasTech Industries Ax-25 blaster cannon. Other features included a retractable illuminator lamp on an articulated mount, control handle rail slots on the sides of the bike, rocker-pivoted foot pedals that controlled the speed and altitude, an acceleration pad with positive traction field near the seat, and the power cell access panel near the rear."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
