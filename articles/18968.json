After jamming transmissions, the Empire decided not to make mass arrests or demand surrender and instead, the Star Destroyers launched an orbital bombardment. One of the many casualties was the rebel Hendri Underholt. Many years after the Galactic Civil War, a rebel artifact, The Rebel Files, was recovered by the planetary governor, Vaxvissh Kal Ness, after an excavation for a new comm tower revealed the artifacts. Eventually, seeing that the artifacts were old war-time rebel relics, intended for senior members of the Alliance, made their way to Major Heck Ensio, Master Archivist Mordianius, and to Commander Korr Sella. Sella then sent it to General Leia Organa of the Resistance, as Organa was one of the few remaining senior members of the Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
