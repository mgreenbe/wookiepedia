He was assigned to guard the entrance to the Power control room. During the initial stages of the Senate hostage crisis, he noticed members of Cad Bane's posse had targeted him with laser scopes. He yelled ineffectually at the bounty hunters, before being gunned down. The commando preceded to try regaining his footing, but was fatally blasted.
