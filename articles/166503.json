There was also a large landlocked sea on the moon. As a relatively young world, the tiny jungle moon experienced a considerable amount of geothermal activity. Large rivers flowed dramatically from volcanic heights and then followed a more meandering pace through the jungles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When scouts from Wetyin's Colony on Setor discovered the moon decades before the current era, the colonists dubbed these continents the names of Starloft, Swivven, Koos and Wetyin, though the scouts eventually left the moon."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Species"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yavin 4's large, sprawling tropical jungles teemed with an abundance of life.

Despite these abuses, his Massassi slaves treated him like a god, building huge temples, filled with treasure, to honor their Sith Lord."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sadow also encased himself in a Sith sarcophagus, where he remained in a coma-like trance for centuries, waiting for someone to call upon his power and continue the history of the Sith. He remained in suspended animation until 4400 BBY, when a fallen Jedi named Freedon Nadd arrived on Yavin 4. By then, the descendants of the Massassi had devolved into a primitive hunter-warrior society, which recalled the Golden Age of the Sith. At first, the Massassi attacked Nadd, though his use of the Force amazed them. Impressed by Nadd's Force powers, the bestial Massassi showed him where the Dark Lord rested, waiting for another with dark-side potential to find him.

In 3996 BBY, Exar Kun along with his Krath and Mandalorian allies waged war on the Republic and the Jedi. The Jedi eventually prevailed and gathered their forces for an assault on Yavin 4. However, as the orbiting Jedi fleet launched a wall of light-side power which bombarded the jungle moon, Kun gathered his Massassi followers into the Great Temple and drained their life energies in order to free his spirit from his body and invest it into the surrounding structures, where he would remain for millennia."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Jedi Cleansing"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi attack obliterated much of the jungles and scorched the temple complex to the extent that nothing could survive.

SIS agent Theron Shan and Sith Lord Lana Beniko brokered a truce between the Republic and the Empire so that they could work together to defeat Revan.

The Rebels established this base in following the abandonment of their previous base on the planet Dantooine. The Galactic Empire sought to use its new space station superweapon, the Death Star I, to destroy the small jungle moon and crush the Rebellion. Following the Destruction of Alderaan, the Empire sent a legion of stormtroopers to confirm Rebel presence on the moon. They discovered the rebels, and established a monitoring outpost at the Massassi Arena. Following the skirmish, a small force of X-wing and Y-wing starfighters were sent to destroy the Death Star, but most were killed in the attack. With the timely assistance of his friend Han Solo, Luke Skywalker was able to fire two proton torpedoes into a small thermal exhaust port in a small trench near the northern pole, thus destroying the station and saving Yavin 4.
