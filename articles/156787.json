The mask was supposedly cursed and formerly belonged to a man who gained power and influence. According to legend, the mask's wearer was eventually killed by his ally, and eventually came to be possessed by Dok-Ondar. The ambassador Slokin bought the mask, despite Dok-Ondar's warnings, and was granted visions of the original wearer's exploits when he put the mask on. Slokin used the mask wearer's tactics to gain his own power, before similarly being killed by his own ally. The mask was returned to Dok-Ondar, who placed it once again in his store."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mask first appeared as a background prop for the Dok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities store at the Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge theme park land, which opened to guests at Disneyland Park and Disney's Hollywood Studios Park in 2019."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mask is often given two different explanations by the store's attendants, with some referring to it as a Sith Acolyte mask while others refer to it as the mask of Darth Momin, despite bearing little resemblance to Momin's mask.
