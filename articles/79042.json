This was intentional - the goal of the project was to create a weapon that approaches the damage of a blaster rifle without the pesky legal restrictions that come with such weapons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The LD-1, with its long barrel, was quite useful as a sniper rifle, and could be disassembled into a carrying case like most such weapons. Additionally, the weapon featured an integrated macroscope and autosteady gyro-gimbals that drastically helped with balance and sighting."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There were rumors of an offshoot of the weapon, the LD-1a, that was produced in limited numbers for the Imperial Security Bureau, which took a few cues from the SoroSuub X-45 sniper rifle, namely its overfocused beam."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
