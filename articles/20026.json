Situated atop a sloping hill at the edge of the broad and shallow Kelita valley, Bralsin overlooked a mass of cultivated farmland, woods, and a number of fortified homesteads. The land around it was speckled with trees and bushes, and it's most notable feature was perhaps the memorial for Fenn Shysa, a deceased Mand'alor who had been beloved by his people. Skulls and bones of Yuuzhan Vong were often found around Bralsin, left over from the Yuuzhan Vong War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The small settlement of Bralsin was chosen by Boba Fett to be the location of a memorial to the dead former Mand'alor, Fenn Shysa. There, on the top of a hill and in a clearing surrounded by a small number of trees, Fett laid Shysa's green and red-colored helmet atop an unmarked column of granite, securing it with a peg against the weather. Close to twenty years would pass before Fett again visited the site."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bralsin was a battlefield during the Yuuzhan Vong War, and it was on Bralsin's soft hills that the Mandalorians battled several thousand Yuuzhan Vong warriors during their attack on Mandalore. The bloodshed was so great that even decades later, skulls of dead Yuuzhan Vong would turn up littered across the landscape when it rained."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 41 ABY, Jedi Knight Jaina Solo journeyed to Mandalore to seek Boba Fett's training and aid in stopping her brother, Jacen Solo\u2014by then a Sith Lord calling himself Darth Caedus. Fett would agree to help train Solo, but Fett's friend Goran Beviin would oftentimes take over training duties. In doing so, he brought Solo to Bralsin, near the memorial to Fenn Shysa. There, the two paid their respects, and Beviin instructed Solo in the use of a Mandalorian beskad saber. Over the time of Solo's Mandalore training, Bralsin became a meeting place between her and Fett and her and Beviin. When Solo arranged a meeting between herself and the former Jedi-turned-Mandalorian, Gotab, it was at Bralsin that they met and after a philosophical discussion between the two, Bralsin became the backdrop for a lightsaber duel between Solo and Gotab's Force-sensitive nephew, Venku Skirata."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bralsin was first introduced to the Star Wars universe in the eighth novel of the Star Wars: Legacy of the Force series.
