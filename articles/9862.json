First commissioned sometime before 232 BBY, the Ataraxia served under the command of Jedi Master Jora Malli at the Battle of Kur and was in service to the Jedi until at least the year 90 BBY. In that year, the Ataraxia was used to transport a number of Jedi to the Outer Rim planet Serenno, in order for Jedi initiates to attend a celebration of the planets and cultures of the galactic region. When one initiate, Dooku, was insulted by fellow initiate Arath Tarrex, he suggested fighting back, but his friend Sifo-Dyas told him that they would be punished as a result, and forced to remain on the Ataraxia for the duration of the event."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ataraxia was first mentioned in the 2019 audiobook Dooku: Jedi Lost, written by Cavan Scott.
