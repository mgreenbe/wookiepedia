The Phantom's were created in the spirit of the New Republic fighter unit Wraith Squadron. Like the Wraith's of the Galactic Civil War, Phantom Squadron pilots were selected for their dual skills as pilots and commandos. In addition, the pilots selected for the squadron often were a mix of highly skilled yet volatile characters. Despite the rough and ready nature of the squadron and its unorthodox tactics, Phantoms were loyal to Admiral Gar Stazi and the GA Remnant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
