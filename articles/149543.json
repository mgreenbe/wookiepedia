During stops, the Stellar Crawler positioned itself over Trivar II's north pole for easier communication to contact Trivar II's growing rebel cell network. Due to the low difficulty of the assignment, Captain Frel became complacent on recent trips to Trivar II, and as a result, a DT-series sentry droid dispatched a patrol craft to intercept the Stellar Crawler, though the Rebel Alliance crew was able to evade capture."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
