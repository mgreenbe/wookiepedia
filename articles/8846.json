Within militaries with multiple branches, the army generally relates to an armed force's ground warfare branch. But within the Imperial Army of the Galactic Empire, the term Army, when used on its own, indicated a distinct level of formation, commanded by a full General, and consisting of a nominal total of 193,644 front-line soldiers in an establishment strength of 293,686 personnel. An average Sector apparently contained four such surface armies, which served as the main, planetary-assault, and surface-warfare force for the Moff's regime; along with a number of garrisons built around Corps HQs, that made up the Systems Army."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Until the last years of the Empire, an Army was rarely deployed as a single formation on a single planet, but it was designed to operate in concert with a standard Troop Squadron of the Imperial Navy, and deployment of the entire formation together began to be considered as the Rebellion grew in force after the Battle of Yavin. More usually, an Army would deploy subordinate units to specific battlefields or theaters: its primary subdivisions were four Corps, any one of which was considered sufficient to retake a rebellious world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Major historic armies"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Imperial Army organization"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An Army was commanded by a full General.
