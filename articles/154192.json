Before the battle, the OOM command battle droid decided to fire on the republic transports despite another droid's objections. He also irritably had to visually point out where to concentrate fire when the same droid expressed confusion as to where he was to fire. When the sergeant accidentally fell off the mesa, the commander saw it as the droid leaving his post and sternly demanded that he return."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
