During the campaign, Tiplar was murdered by clone trooper CT-5385, nicknamed \"Tup,\" after a malfunction in the clone's behavioral modification biochip that triggered a premature activation of Clone Protocol 66, a Sith-implanted command that forced clones to kill Jedi as traitors.

Along with Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, Tiplee led an assault on Vizsla Keep 09, a Mandalorian supply outpost, where Maul was hiding.

By the Clone Wars, Tiplee and her sister were active enemies of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and they both served as Jedi Generals within the Grand Army of the Republic during the war. Fighting against the Separatists' forces, both of them were accomplished leaders in the Republic Military, and Tiplee and Tiplar occasionally served alongside each other, including during the Republic campaign at the planet Ringo Vinda, fighting alongside such clone troopers as Commander Doom, to take an orbital space station from the Confederacy. Along with Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, the two Jedi sisters led the clone troopers under their command against the battle droid forces of Admiral Trench. After several encounters, the Republic forces reached the station's communication center and captured it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While preparing to conquer the command center, clone trooper CT-5385, nicknamed \"Tup,\" underwent an unexpected malfunction in a secret organic chip within his head; the chip, clandestinely implanted in all clones by the Sith during the cloning process, initiated Clone Protocol 66 sooner than the Sith intended, causing Tup to face mental lapses that left him agitated and confused. While in a trance, in which the protocol's command to kill Jedi as traitors was activated, he sneaked up behind Tiplar and shot her to death. Tiplee watched as her sister was murdered, and Tiplar's death stalled the Republic momentum. The Jedi and Republic forces quickly apprehended Tup and retreated with him and Tiplar's body further back into the station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon their return to their base, Tiplee mourned her sister while Skywalker interrogated Tup. Tiplee arrived to observe the interrogation, and Tup, still feeling the effects of the chip's malfunction, tried to attack her, despite being restrained. Tiplee quickly stopped him by using the Force to levitate him and hold Tup against the wall until he calmed down. She showed anger towards the clone, but Skywalker was able to help her control her emotions and convinced her to release Tup. Tiplee was later present in a medical bay where Tup was examined, and the clone stated that he did not remember killing Tiplar. The cause of Tup's motivation to murder Tiplar remained unclear, though Tiplee and the others suspected that the Separatists may have somehow developed an anti-clone virus. With no clear answers, Tup was sent to Kamino, the planet on which the clones were created, for examination. Tup died on Kamino, where his friend and fellow clone CT-5555 discovered the Sith plot and why Tiplar was murdered.

The Jedi deduced that Maul, who captured Separatist leaders Count Dooku and General Grievous on Ord Mantell, might have taken his prisoners to the nearby Vizsla Keep 09. Kenobi and Tiplee were sent to investigate the outpost and root out any Shadow Collective forces. While en route, Tiplee expressed concern that Kenobi would have difficulty keeping his emotions in check, as Maul had murdered Kenobi's close personal friend, Duchess Satine Kryze of Mandalore, but Kenobi assured her that he would be able to handle a confrontation with Maul."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When their Republic attack cruiser arrived in the asteroid field surrounding the outpost, Kenobi and Tiplee departed with their forces, and their gunships encountered Gauntlet fighters from Death Watch, the warrior group that ruled Mandalore and a member of the Shadow Collective.
