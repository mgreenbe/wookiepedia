Syndulla started as a political revolutionary who opposed the corruption of Ryloth's senator, Orn Free Taa, but the invasion of Ryloth by the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars saw him turn his attention towards rebellion. He formed the Twi'lek Resistance and fought alongside Jedi Master Ima-Gun Di and the Grand Army of the Republic in their initial attempts to repel the Separatist warlord Wat Tambor and the Separatist Droid Army, but the Republic's initial assistance was limited and the Twi'leks were vastly outnumbered. Though Syndulla was reluctant to trust the Republic again and feared a Republic military occupation of Ryloth, Syndulla ultimately allied himself with Jedi General Mace Windu and, together, they liberated Ryloth from the Separatists."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His concerns over the Republic were eventually confirmed when, at the end of the Clone Wars, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine declared himself Emperor and transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire. Even though Syndulla initially hoped for peace, Ryloth fell under Imperial Military occupation, and his wife Eleni Syndulla was killed by the Empire. Ultimately, Syndulla formed the Free Ryloth Movement to fight back. He and the movement hoped to strike a crippling blow to the Empire by attempting to assassinate the Emperor and his apprentice, Darth Vader, when they visited Ryloth, but the plot failed. In reality, it was a trick by the Emperor to lure the Free Ryloth movement into a trap. Many of the movement's members were killed, but Syndulla managed to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Syndulla's wife Eleni was killed at some point during the Twi'lek rebellion and also had a son who died young, so Syndulla fully dedicated himself to his cause and cared only about liberating Ryloth. This created strain in Syndulla's relationship with his daughter, Hera, who left Ryloth to fight the Empire on other worlds. In the third year before the Battle of Yavin, Syndulla partnered with Hera and her rebel forces in order to capture an Imperial carrier over Ryloth for the rebel fleet. The elder Syndulla briefly betrayed the rebels in an attempt to destroy the carrier, hoping to use its destruction as a symbol to rally the people of Ryloth to the cause of his resistance, but he ultimately helped the rebels capture the carrier. In the process, an Arquitens-class command cruiser was destroyed, giving Syndulla the symbol he hoped for. The events led him to reconcile with Hera and see the virtues of fighting the Empire beyond just Ryloth. By the time of the outbreak of the Galactic Civil War, Cham had become a grandfather to Jacen Syndulla, a male human-Twi'lek who was the son of Cham's daughter Hera and the Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Political revolutionary"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cham Syndulla hailed from the planet Ryloth, homeworld of the Twi'leks. Syndulla became a political revolutionary and opposed what he saw as the corruption in the Galactic Republic. For Syndulla, the corruption had no greater face than that of Orn Free Taa, the senator of Ryloth. The distrust that Syndulla felt towards the senator was mutual; Taa considered Syndulla to be a political radical, one who was unpredictable and sought to gain power for himself. In actuality, Syndulla's goal was the freedom of his people, which he fought for throughout his life. Syndulla married a Twi'lek woman named Eleni, and they had a daughter, Hera, together. Hera was inspired by his leadership amongst their people."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Fall of Ryloth"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, twenty-two years before the Battle of Yavin, Emir Wat Tambor of the Techno Union led the Separatist Droid Army in an invasion of Ryloth. As Hera and Eleni fled underground, Syndulla turned his political revolution into an armed resistance movement and formed the Twi'lek Resistance to combat the Separatist Alliance and liberate his world. Syndulla and his freedom fighters were the first to battle the Separatist forces on Ryloth. Eleni joined her husband's effort. They were soon aided by a garrison from the Grand Army of the Republic, under the command of Jedi General Ima-Gun Di and Clone Captain Keeli. With their help, Syndulla mounted a defense of a Twi'lek refugee encampment, where the resistance fighters' families dwelled, against an army of battle droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Along with his friend and fellow soldier Gobi Glie, Syndulla commanded the resistance against the approaching battle droids. The situation turned dire as the resistance forces began running low on food, water, and ammunition as a result of the Separatist blockade of Ryloth. General Di attempted to find more supplies by sending a message to the Jedi High Council through the orbiting Republic fleet, but the fleet was destroyed and the Republic supply lines were completely cut off. Without the Republic's re-supply efforts, the Republic and resistance forces lost more ground to the droid army and became trapped in the cliffs where the refugee village had been established."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The dire situation tested Syndulla's faith in the Grand Army of the Republic, and it seemed that the survival of the resistance was a lost cause. General Syndulla felt betrayed by the turn of events; he and his people were promised Republic assistance, and the Republic did not deliver. Di, however, came up with a plan to save the refugees and the resistance fighters. To do so, they would use their remaining gunship as a bomb that would collapse an adjacent pass, cutting the Separatists off from the resistance fighters and their families. Once the pass collapsed, Di and Keeli would cover the Twi'lek retreat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the plan was in motion, Syndulla and Glie prepared their forces and their families to leave, while the Republic began their distraction. Syndulla successfully led his people to safety, but Di and Keeli were killed while providing cover for the resistance. Their sacrifice, however, was not a lost cause; the Twi'lek Resistance lived to fight another day, and the Republic\u2014with the help of Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan and the King Katuunko of Toydaria\u2014sent re-supply ships through the Separatist blockade. With the Republic able to slip through, the resistance fighters and their people acquired the food and medical supplies they so desperately needed."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Liberating Ryloth"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After escaping, the resistance forces continued to engage the Separatist Droid Army in the hopes of liberating Ryloth, though Syndulla no longer had any desire to see assistance from the Republic that had failed to help them before. The Separatists pursued Syndulla's forces and slaughtered many Twi'leks, littering the plains of Ryloth with the bodies of Twi'leks who stood against them. The freedom fighters set up refugee camps underground, which they maintained while engaging droid patrols."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite their initial losses, the Republic mounted a major offensive to retake Ryloth from Wat Tambor and the Separatists, scoring a number of victories against the Droid Army. Jedi General Mace Windu traveled to Ryloth with the intention of taking the capital of Lessu from the droids, and the Republic suffered losses in a failed attempt to retake the capital. Windu sought out Syndulla in the plains, where the general surrounded the Jedi as Windu explained he and his forces, including ARF troopers Stak and Razor, had come to enlist Syndulla's help in liberating Ryloth. Syndulla brought the Jedi into his camp, where he found that Glie had been injured and urged him to tend to his wounds so he could return to the fight. After seeing to his friend, Syndulla offered Windu food and drink. Supplies were short, but Syndulla honored the traditions of Twi'lek hospitality."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Syndulla was reluctant to trust Windu for a number of reasons. Not only had the Republic already abandoned Ryloth once, but Syndulla also feared what would happen after the liberation of Ryloth\u2014to the freedom fighter, a Republic military presence on Ryloth, supported by Senator Taa, was simply another armed occupation, and Ryloth could not truly be free under such conditions. Once Syndulla learned that the Separatists had begun bombing Twi'lek villages, however, Syndulla agreed to speak with the senator. Though the conversation between the two was tense and full of bickering, Windu focused them on the matter at hand. As they spoke, Jedi General Anakin Skywalker reported that his clone forces engaged the Separatists that were bombing the Twi'lek villages. Syndulla and Taa came to realize that Tambor knew his defeat was imminent and was choosing to destroy whatever he could not have. To put aside their differences, Taa promised that the Grand Army of the Republic would not occupy Ryloth, while Syndulla agreed that he would not seek political power. With those promises, Syndulla was officially allied with the Republic and rallied his freedom fighters to finish the fight with the Separatists."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finding a way into the capital city proved to be a particular challenge, as the only entry point was a plasma bridge that was controlled from within the city itself. Making matters worse was that Tambor moved the city's population to sit on the outside of the city, which prevented the Republic from launching a direct attack lest there be civilian causalities. The allied forces soon discovered a way in, however, when the resistance discovered Separatist Multi-Troop Transports that were traveling along a cliff overlooking the city. Syndulla informed Windu about the transports and how they were carrying treasures for Emir Tamor. Windu, Stak, and Razor infiltrated one of the transports and made it across the bridge, while Syndulla and his forces engaged the Separatists to give Windu time to activate the plasma bridge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the bridge was activated, Syndulla led the charge into Lessu, where the resistance fought against the Droid Army. Windu, meanwhile, captured Emir Tambor. When he was captured, the leader of the Separatists, the Sith Lord Count Dooku, ordered Separatist bombers to destroy the city. The city was saved, however, by the arrival of General Skywalker and his Padawan, Commander Ahsoka Tano, flying Jedi starfighters. With the capital secure, Tambor formally surrendered to Syndulla, and the resistance leader thanked General Windu for his assistance. He later joined Windu, along with Senator Taa, to watch a parade that celebrated the liberation of Ryloth. The liberation of Ryloth and Syndulla's leadership over the resistance was remembered in songs which celebrated the Battle of Lessu."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Age of the Empire"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Balancing family and Ryloth"}, {"tag": "h5", "text": "Dawn of the Free Ryloth Movement"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The liberation of Ryloth was short-lived.

Ryloth fell under Imperial Military occupation and had its resources plundered, so Syndulla organized and led the Free Ryloth Movement in order to liberate his homeworld. Though his fears about the Republic were proven true, Syndulla nonetheless held the Jedi in high regard.

While his friend Captain Howzer, a clone trooper who had transitioned into Imperial service, felt that it was the right viewpoint, Gobi Glie began establishing a resistance effort. Nevertheless, during a public gathering he held with Senator Taa, Syndulla tried to calm the public's concerns about the Empire. Later, however, Taa informed Vice Admiral Rampart about Syndulla's influence over the public, and Hera was captured by Imperial forces for helping Glie's resistance.

Unlike her father, who only believed in fighting for the liberation of the Twi'leks, Hera hoped to see the whole galaxy freed from the Empire. She left Ryloth and set out to organize her own rebel movement, one that would ultimately become part of a larger rebellion against the Empire. Despite the strain in their relationship, Syndulla was heartbroken that his daughter left Ryloth. The two would not speak for several years, though Syndulla did hear stories about Hera's rebel crew, including the Jedi Kanan Jarrus.
