In 3 ABY, Roja, Namir and the soldier Beak escorted Twilight Company's Captain Micha Evon, known as Howl, and the ex-Imperial Governor Everi Chalis to the Echo Base, the Alliance High Command's secret base on the planet Hoth.

They were cautious of distant gunfire, and the rest of them waited while Namir scouted. As they then approached the hangar down a hallway, the group was cut off by the Sith Lord Darth Vader and his stormtroopers. Roja, Beak and Namir fired at the incoming Imperials, but the Sith Lord continued to advance and cut Beak in half.

Roja and his roommates were awoken by the Thunderstrike's klaxons. He asked Namir what was going on, but the man did not have an answer.

The group took a shuttle which used a programmed route, sent to Howl via coded messages, that went into the Outer Rim's Anoat sector, where the Hoth system was located.

Meanwhile, Roja and Beak, with the approval of Namir, were assigned to teams matching their specialities under Echo Base commanders. Roja befriended the technicians assigned to the base's T-47 airspeeders at a speed that shocked Namir, who was put on patrol and other jobs.

Roja and Beak found him the night after, and the pair mocked the base troops and the present special forces, not explaining their change of heart.

The first sergeant was then interrupted by cannonfire from Echo Base's V-150 Planet Defender, which had provided cover for an escaping rebel transport.

As Imperial scout forces fanned out from the route of the AT-ATs, an two floating gunnery platforms, carrying Cold weather assault stormtroopers from the Empire's 501st Legion and escorted by an AT-ST walker, approached. Namir ordered the sole turret to fire on the platforms and Roja and Beak crouched in the trenches. As the AT-ST advanced, the three began shooting at the walker, which layed waste to the turret.

As the trio reached the corridor to the command center, where the beamed has collapsed, Namir had Roja and Beak hold position while the first sergeant clambered through.

Roja himself huddled with Chalis and Howl. Vader leapt forward and cut Beak in half with his lightsaber. Roja then threw a fragmentation grenade at the Sith Lord, shouting an oath as he did so.
