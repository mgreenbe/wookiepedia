While all such buildings were laboratories of sorts, each looked beyond the galactic rim in a different direction and was infused with a specific purpose. Some hosted weapon designs or the weapons themselves, while others housed ancient Sith artifacts, and others still were prisons in which the lifeforces of those captured were harnessed. The Jakku Observatory, located near the Plaintive Hand plateau, was meant to play a role in the Contingency. Another Observatory was located on the planet Pillio."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
