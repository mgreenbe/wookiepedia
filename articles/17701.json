Forged thousands of years before the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, in a time before lightsabers, the Blade was used by Renge to kill hundreds of the Emperor's enemies. However, when Renge attempted to betray the Emperor sometime well before 3950 BBY, the Blade was turned upon its owner. Part of the sword broke off in Renge's chest, and though his wounds were healed before he was cast into the depths of the Dark Temple on the planet Dromund Kaas, the fragment remained buried in Renge's body."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Blade of the Sith Executioner was first mentioned in its own Codex entry in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a 2011 video game released by BioWare in which the Blade was originally slated to appear before being cut."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
