It contained many treasures, including eight Mendacian funeral urns. It was discovered by Gorga Desilijic Aarrpo after Jabba's death, but was hijacked by Big Gizz and Spiker. They soon discovered the Jabba Tape, an automated computer defense program that nearly killed them before Onoh entered the proper authorization code. The ship was shot down by the Nemphas in the desert beyond Mos Eisley."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
