It consisted of a small hilt containing a retractable blade and an explosive charge. Once stabbed into an enemy, the explosive could be activated remotely, killing the target. The explosion could also be activated if struck by blaster fire. The shape of the blade made it difficult to remove once implanted in the victim."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a second battle on Dac during the Clone Wars, Riff Tamson used explosive knives against several Mon Calamari and Gungans. Mon Calamari Prince Lee-Char stole one of these knives and stabbed Tamson with it, then shot it with a Mon Calamari spear blaster. The resulting explosion killed Tamson, effectively removing any Separatist threat of the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
