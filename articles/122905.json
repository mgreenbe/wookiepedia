The base threatened Galactic Republic supply routes along the Corellian Run, so the Republic dispatched forces under the command of Admiral Jonoin to destroy the facility. The Republic carried out an orbital bombardment of the base, but it was unsuccessful because the base was protected by a deflector shield. Jonoin therefore ordered Republic ground forces to land on Garia and knock out the base's control center, to shut down the shield."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
