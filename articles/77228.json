During the Imperial Era, Pru hired the human Mahjo Reeloo as an assistant, and he created a clone of her. During this time, Pru was contracted by the Mandragonian Mob to replicate a sample of a thornsuckle plant, a poisonous species believed to have gone extinct. The Mandragonian Mob intended to mass-produce the plant to create a bioweapon. When Reeloo discovered this, she attempted to foil Pru's operation with a defoliator bomb. The device was activated aboard Pru's starship, and both he and the thornsuckle sample were presumed to have been destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kolac Pru first appeared in the canon junior novel Pirate's Price, which was written by Lou Anders, illustrated by Annie Wu, and published in 2019."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
