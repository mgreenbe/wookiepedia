In 2974 BBY, the Doomed leader Kaliska and the Sith princess Takara Hilts used the Force power animal friendship to convince all of the uvaks at that stable to fly them back to Eshkrene. This action effectively deprived the Sith Lord Remulus Dreypa of an \"air force\" and provided the Doomed with beasts of steed which enabled them to participate in the Battle of Sessal Spire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
