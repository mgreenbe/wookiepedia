During the trade wars, Vice Chairman Anolo hired a Givin codebreaker to help in an effort to take over Hutt smuggling routes. However, Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure learned of the Givin and sought to use the codebreaker for his own operations, so he dispatched bounty hunter Greedo to capture the Givin. Such an action would have altered the course of the trade wars, but the Rodian bounty hunter failed in his mission; after killing Anolo and while trying to escape Muun guards, he overestimated how strong a grabbing line was. The codebreaker fell and died, which angered Jabba, as he believed he could have made billions of credits in smuggling with the Givin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
