According to Dawson, Moradi can be seen as a \"female Poe Dameron\" for her humor, ego, and talent, but with an added dash of James Bond. Moradi was originally identified as \"Amaka\" on James Zapata's blog, who designed her, Cardinal's and Keldo's appearances. Dawson was asked to change the name to Vi when it was determined that the character would appear in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, for which the actress and stuntwoman Alex Marshall-Brown originated the role. The character played a role in the opening ceremonies for both versions of Galaxy's Edge, and can be randomly encountered by visitors. She is portrayed by a number of different actresses at both parks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
