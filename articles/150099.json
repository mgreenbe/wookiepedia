No landing directions were given and there were no landing pads; incoming ships merely found a spot on the desert. The population of Tun Aduban was comprised mostly of drifters and unlucky spacers. The city had little to offer beyond cantinas, brothels, and merchants selling illicit goods. Places of interest included the House of a Higher Power, Locru's Central Saloon, and Spacer's Hill."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
