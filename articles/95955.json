Following the attack, Republic forces pursued Barakk's starfighter through the the Works district of Coruscant, flushing out the Neebray Manta, which had been hidden there. The Republic had been searching for Qwok for months, suspecting him of having links to their enemy, the Confederacy of Independent Systems, so the Republic ships peeled off from their pursuit of Barakk and went after the Manta. The freighter then fired rockets on the Republic ships, so they defended themselves by firing back on the Neebray Manta. The freighter then crashed to the ground in flames, and was destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Neebray Manta appeared in the Decide Your Destiny novel The Clone Wars: Decide Your Destiny: Crisis on Coruscant.
