Like all Shards, the Iron Knights required droid bodies to interact with the world, hence their name. They used Juggernaut war droids, FLTCH-series battle droids, and Uulshos justice droids as their hosts. Many Iron Knights took as their name that of lightsaber crystals, reflecting both their connection to the Force and their crystalline bodies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their first major appearance in the galaxy was at the Arkanian Revolution, where they assisted a team of Jedi sent by the Republic to end the conflict. The Jedi Council, however, was horrified that Aqinos had taught inorganic crystals about the Force, and felt that they could not truly understand the Force. Aqinos was excommunicated, and the Iron Knights went with him. Many survived the Great Jedi Purge by hiding out on the planet Dweem."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They were later discovered by a group of students from the New Jedi Order, who put together clues provided by Callista Ming.

The explanation was to be that a Shard lived in the droid, but Pe\u00f1a felt the idea was \"too warped\" and so removed it from the final version."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
