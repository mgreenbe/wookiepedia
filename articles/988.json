The team, at some point captured a First Order droid named O-MR1, who they believed knew the location of Ackbar. On the way back to the Resistance base, the team's ship crashed on Taul and the only survivors of the crash were 2MED2, O-MR1, the protocol droid C-3PO, the construction droid CO-34, and the two security droids PZ-99 and VL-44."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The group of droids decided to work together to get home.
