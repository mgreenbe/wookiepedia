When a crime was committed on Cloud City, and the perpetrator caught, they were brought before a Guild Tribunal with a panel of three guild representatives. The guild members were drawn from the guild most associated with the crime; a corrupt Sabacc dealer would be tried by members of the Gambling Guild, a seller of fake goods by the Merchant's Guild, murderers by the Security Guild or Weaponry Guild. Arbitrations are fair, even against other guild members due to the Parliament's desire to remain impartial lest judicial authority pass to the Exex due to perceived biases."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
