Starlighter was politically supportive of the Galactic Empire, as well as its principal leaders, Emperor Palpatine and Sith Lord Darth Vader. Unlike other skeptical life forms, she held the Wookiee species in high regard and found them to be friendly to strangers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bree Starlighter was a Human female who, circa 1 BBY, worked as Chief Holo-Communications Officer and galactic travel liaison for Star Tours, an interstellar space travel company affiliated with the Galactic Tourist Bureau. Around that time, Starlighter promoted the opening of Star Tours' first hub in Spaceport THX1138, located in the Earth system, with two of her co-workers beside her at the ceremony, droids C-3PO and R2-D2. She hosted the event, answered questions from the public, and offered discounts on flights."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Starlighter sometimes traveled while accompanied by a member of the Wookiee species to promote their homeworld of Kashyyyk as a suitable tourist destination. She did so to help convince skeptics that Wookiees were not aggressive toward strangers. Starlighter also participated in some Star Tours advertisements, in which she invited galactic citizens to choose her company for interstellar travel and promoted the firm's recently acquired fleet of StarSpeeder 1000 starships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Nagai\u2013Tof War, Star Tours employed droids for their public relations.

She also had a penchant for exaggerating in this capacity, as she claimed that Star Tours offered travel to all known worlds and even all galaxies despite later revealing that Star Tours, in fact, served only fifty-four destinations. Starlighter shared a good relationship with fellow co-working droids C-3PO and R2-D2, whom she considered two of her \"favorite employees,\" praising Threepio for his meticulousness and highlighting Artoo for his brightness and importance to the company. She also believed in the concept of the Force and publicly stated so while on duty. Additionally, the officer had a positive view of Wookiees and suggested she disliked mothers-in-law."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 1 BBY, Starlighter expressed support for the Galactic Empire, the galaxy's dominant governing power during that period, as well as its primary leaders, Emperor Palpatine and the Sith Lord Darth Vader, However, she hinted that Vader often visited Star Tours' home office, which she later denied, adding that he was \"great\" and a \"positive force for change.\" At the time, Vader was suspicious of noted Rebel Alliance member Captain Raymus Antilles' involvement with the company and speculated that Star Tours was linked to the Rebellion. In addition, a Rebel spy was also found in one of their flights, yet the vessel deliberately evaded Imperial pursuit and landed the spy safely. However, Starlighter minimized those concerns, stating on record that the Sith Lord was working toward making the galaxy \"perfect\" to live in, denying any darkness in his actions. Although Starlighter recognized that the Empire was significantly involved in space voyage, she also believed the Imperials were completely in favor of free travel. As a safety recommendation, Starlighter advised that travelers conceal any lightsabers within their luggage to avoid reprisals from Imperial stormtroopers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Starlighter had fair skin and sported blonde and purple hair with a braid. On occasion, she also wore rings, bracelets, earrings, and black-colored accessories near her lips and around her dark-brown eyes, as well as makeup on the eyelids and cheeks. Starlighter wore at least two distinct Star Tours uniforms, one blue and silver and another black and silver with gray pants and boots, both with metallic-looking company pins at chest height displaying her name in High Galactic alphabet and the Star Tours logo in Aurebesh script."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Tours public relations officer Bree Starlighter was portrayed by actress Angela Napoleon during the Star Tours: The Adventures Continue promotional mall tour.

While in-character, Napoleon also made a point of deliberately twitching her eye and maintaining a facial tic when mentioning the Galactic Empire and Darth Vader positively."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In a radio interview, Angela Napoleon, while playing Starlighter, jokingly stated that there were no chickens in her homeworld, and that her planet's residents usually ate another animal, pronounced with click consonants.
