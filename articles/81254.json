Like most cities on Ryloth, Lessu was located in the relatively narrow band of habitable land on that planet. During the Clone Wars, the Separatist Droid Army, commanded by Wat Tambor, took control of the planet and took the Twi'leks as prisoners. The Separatists installed a plasma bridge as the only way to get into the city, which they could turn on or shut down. The capital was later freed by the combined forces of freedom fighters and the Galactic Republic, guided by Jedi Master Mace Windu and rebel leader Cham Syndulla, with aerial support from Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano's fighter squadron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The city is misspelled as \"Lessau\" - and mispronounced by Anakin as such - in the Republic Heroes video game."}]}
