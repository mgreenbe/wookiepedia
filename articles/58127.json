It was formed after the War of the Gungan tribes, when Boss Gallo defeated Boss Rogoe. It largely remained isolationist after the Grizmalltian Settlers colonized Naboo. Around 32 BBY, the society opened up to the rest of the galaxy and had their first representative in the Galactic Senate. During the Imperial Period, they worked closely but secretly with the Royal House and the people in opposing the Empire. The society was divided into communities and its military was the Gungan Grand Army."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
