Over a seven year period, Rinnrivin created a criminal empire based on smuggling and gambling. Eventually, Rinnrivin's activities exacted a heavy economic toll on the Gaulus sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following a request by the Ryloth government, the New Republic senators Leia Organa and Ransolm Casterfo investigated the criminal syndicate and uncovered its links to the Amaxine warriors. The Amaxines, led by the former Imperial officer Arliz Hadrassian, bombed the Senatorial conference building in Hosnian Prime, in a failed attempt to distract the Galactic Senate. This drew Leia and Ransolm's attention to the Amaxines. The conflict also coincided with political tensions between the Centrists and Populists, two powerful factions in the Galactic Senate, and plans to create a new post called First Senator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While visiting Daxam IV, Casterfo gained Hadrassian's trust and learned that the Amaxines' main base was located on the planet Sibensko in the Expansion Region. Meanwhile, Leia and her team discovered that Rinnrivin was also hiding on Sibensko. Before the two senators could travel to Sibensko, the two fell out after Lady Carise Sindian, a clandestine agent of the First Order, supplied information about Leia's true parentage as the daughter of Darth Vader. Due to the political fallout, Leia's credibility was undermined and she was forced to withdraw her nomination for First Senator.

The New Republic, the successor government to the Alliance to Restore the Republic, signed a peace treaty with the remnants of the defeated Empire known as the Galactic Concordance. The Galactic Concordance imposed strict disarmament treaties and war reparations on the remnants of the Empire. For the next twenty-nine years, the \"Old Empire\" became a remnant of political hardliners who eventually retreated to the Unknown Regions. There, they formed a new military junta called the First Order, which admired the policies and principles of the Old Empire. Believing that the Imperials no longer posed a threat, the New Republic turned its attention to reshaping galactic politics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "About thirteen years prior to the destruction of the Hosnian system, the First Order began using a paramilitary faction called the Amaxine warriors to funnel billions of credits into the Nikto crime lord Rinnrivin Di's cartel. Rinnrivin's cartel in returned channeled much of its smuggling and gambling revenue to unidentified sources and shadow corporations on Centrist worlds, which funneled the money back to the First Order. The First Order used these proceeds to rebuild the old Imperial fleet, which had retreated into the Unknown Regions following the Galactic Concordance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Amaxine warriors on the surface acted as the financiers and partners of Rinnrivin's cartel. Their leader Arliz Hadrassian, a former TIE fighter pilot who admired the Old Empire and hated the New Republic, also began marshaling troops and starships for an armed insurrection against the Republic. Hadrassian maintained a tenuous relationship with another First Order agent, the New Republic Senator Lady Carise Sindian; who was a prominent member of the Centrists faction in the Galactic Senate. Lady Carise channeled Rinnrivin's profits back to the First Order.

Rinnrivin's smuggling operations drained revenue from legitimate commercial traffic. Legitimate ships were raided while merchants were extorted into paying protection money. Rinnrivin's cartel was able to thrive in the Gaulus sector due to poorly-enforced New Republic financial regulations and infrequent naval patrols of the galactic traffic lanes. The New Republic's indecisiveness was the result of frequent bickering within the Galactic Senate between two powerful factions, the Centrists and the Populists. The Centrists advocated a stronger central government and military while the Populists championed the autonomy of individual worlds. Several Centrists included Lady Carise admired the Old Empire and had secret ties to the First Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Rinnrivin's cartel exacting a heavy toll on Ryloth's economy, the planet's Emissary Yendor traveled to the New Republic capital of Hosnian Prime to lobby the Galactic Senate into taking action.

After the Populists failed to block the motion, Leia's colleagues Senators Tai-Lin Garr and Varish Vicly urged her to stand for First Senator due to her charisma and respect as a rebel leader. Preoccupied with matters on Hosnian Prime, Leia dispatched her pilot Greer Sonnel and the starfighter pilot Joph Seastriker to Pamarthe to investigate whether Rinnrivin was recruiting pilots from there. Greer was a native of Pamarthe and Leia believed that she would be ideal for the mission. There, the two pilots discovered that Rinnrivin was hiring Amaxine pilots from nearby Daxam IV, a barren Centrist world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Joph's preliminary investigations determined that the Amaxines were operating in Centrist-aligned worlds. Suspecting that certain Centrist senators were harboring the paramilitary section, Leia convinced Casterfo to investigate the Amaxine presence on Daxam IV. Casterfo, who was an avid collector of Imperial artifacts, was able to take advantage of a planned rendezvous with a prospective seller on Daxam IV to travel to that planet. Meanwhile, Leia met Lady Carise, who was interested in inheriting the Supreme governorship of Birren. Since the previous governor Lord Mellowyn had died, Leia and her son Ben Solo were his designated successors due to Leia being the adopted daughter of Bail and Breha Organa.

While Lady Carise had asked her to create a distraction, Hadrassian's action only drew more attention to the Amaxines. While no senators or staff were killed, the so-called \"Napkin Bombing\" was the first security incident since the end of the Galactic Civil War and led the Centrists and Populists to blame each other for the bombing. Despite the political infighting, Leia and Casterfo decided to continue with their investigations into Rinnrivin's cartel and the Amaxine warriors.

Meanwhile, Casterfo befriended Arliz Hadrassian and gained her trust by posing as an Imperial sympathizer. Greer also discovered that the Amaxines had a sizeable military encampment and at least five starfighter squadrons based on Daxam IV.

After C-3PO sliced into one of Rinnrivin's satellites, Leia and her team discovered that Rinnrivin was hiding on Sibensko. Being able to track Rinnrivin's movements through his satellite, Leia traveled to Harloff Minor near Coruscant and met up with the crime lord. While Rinnrivin was not nvolved in the Napkin Bombing, he expressed admiration for Leia and attempted to bribe the prospective First Senator.

Knowing that several Centrists were avid collectors of Imperial artifacts and relics, Casterfo hosted a private reception.

Korrie resigned in protest and Leia quickly penned a message comforting her son about his grand-parentage. Most importantly, Leia's friendship with Casterfo was badly damaged with the two blaming each other for the scandal. Despite this major setback, Leia's husband Han Solo and several friends and companions including Tai-Lin Garr, Varish Vichly, C-3PO, Joph, Greer, the former Chancellor Mon Mothma, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, Gial Ackbar, and Nien Nunb stood by her."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mission to Sibensko"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the political uproar, Leia was determined to continue her investigation into the Amaxine warriors' presence on Sibensko.

While Greer and Joph loaded a shipment of detonators destined for Hosnian Prime, Leia and C-3PO managed to access a computer in a cantina in the Sibensko underwater city.

Leia managed to take a lift into the Amaxine base where she discovered they had several starfighters. She was soon pursued by several Amaxine youths but managed to escape up a landing platform which rose to the sea. The Amaxines dispatched two starfighters, a Y-wing and a B-wing to destroy her.

While the Amaxines and Rinnrivin's cartel had been eliminated, the Senator warned the Galactic Senate that other threats to the Republic still existed. She urged the senators to abandon their complacency and their petty differences to protect the Republic.

Hadrassian then killed herself before she could be taken into custody. With Hadrassian's death, many believed that the Amaxines were Rinnrivin's partners and financiers, and that they had staged the Napkin bombing.

Due to the political tensions, the Senate passed a motion to suspend future elections including those for First Senator. Lady Carise supported this motion since it allowed her to begin planning another motion to secede the Centrist worlds from the New Republic. Lady Carise decided to follow the late Hadrassian's request to secede from the Republic and join the First Order. However, Senator Organa determined that Lady Carise had been responsible for the revelations into her parentage and Casterfo's frame-up.
