They could be programmed to make a large variety of food items, making them compatible with unique alien tastes. The food synthesizers were commonly found on starships, but could often be seen in residences as well. Even if a ship was equipped with a synthesizer, it would still carry food for emergencies. The Ebon Hawk had a food synthesizer that apparently produced poor-tasting food, prompting Jolee Bindo to ask Revan if he ever cleaned it. The Millennium Falcon also had a food synthesizer, that Allana Solo claimed to be able to use."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
