He then waited outside their Hedrett warehouse and monitored their transmissions for the next day. His data showed no special transmissions made that would indicate a search underway. Consequently, when the Navy of Thaere reported back to Jex 24 hours later that his brother was not on Cularin, he suspected they had not actually searched at all. One of Jex's friends took this as evidence that the Thaereians were actually behind the disappearances."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
