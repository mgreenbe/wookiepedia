T-215 believed that droids should break the shackles imposed onto them by sentient beings and it traveled the galaxy, visiting droid factories and sector palaces, stirring up droid rebellions as it went. Numerous critics of the Droid Equality Foundation highlighted T-215 as an example of why droids should not have full rights, and the droid was accused of causing various uprisings and acts of sabotage. However, the Foundation's legal team worked hard to ensure that sufficient evidence of T-215's involvement in such activities could not be obtained."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
