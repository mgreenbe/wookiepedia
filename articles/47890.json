The native Aki-Aki held the celebration every forty-two years, honoring the past and looking forward to the future. While most attendees of the festival were Aki-Aki, a number of off-worlders visited the planet to partake in the celebrations. It was known for its colored kites and delectable sweets, according to the protocol droid C-3PO. Other events held at the festival included massive crowd-dances and various places where Aki-Aki could burn their ancestors in effigy to celebrate and honor them. Off-world visitors are welcomed and are often given necklaces of flowers to welcome them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Festival of the Ancestors was created for the 2019 movie Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, the third and final installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy.
