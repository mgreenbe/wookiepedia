In many cases, that skeleton was made of rigid bones. That of the Gungans, however, was much more flexible because it was made of of cartilaginous material. In some case, the protective and supporting structure of a creature covered the outside of its body, in which case it was referred to as an exoskeleton. Metaphorically speaking, a skeleton crew was the minimum number of personnel needed to operate a starship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
