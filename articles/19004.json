The bomb was meant to kill Ta'a Chume, the matriarch of Hapes, and her granddaughter Tenel Ka, the Hapan princess. However, because they had unexpectedly decided to eat in Tenel Ka's private room with her friends and fellow Jedi trainees Lowbacca, Jacen Solo, and Jaina Solo, no one was hurt by the explosion of the bomb. As a result of the bomb, the young Jedi were sent to the private island stronghold of the Royal Family of Hapes, Reef Fortress, where they were watched over by Yfra, who was Ta'a Chume's personal ambassador, and some Hapan Honor Guards. Ta'a Chume traveled back and forth between Reef Fortress and Fountain Palace as she personally attended the investigation of the bombing. Later, one of the bomb conspirators was caught. However, the prisoner was poisoned before she could be interrogated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bombing of Fountain Palace was described in Young Jedi Knights: Lightsabers written by Kevin J.
