Because of this, their squinting, sensitive eyes were easily damaged on lighter worlds, and their photosensitive skin burned and blistered when exposed to direct sunlight. Some wore protective clothing when outside, consisting of articulated faceplates, flexible cowl armor, long coats, gloves, and full-seal armored coverings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grindalids hatched from eggs and lived in watery pools as youngsters. They had pale faces, squinting eyes, and large, curved heads. While seemingly humanoid in appearance while wearing armored coverings, Grindalids had tapered tail segments in place of legs.
