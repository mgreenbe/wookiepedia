The crew reach Maz's Castle, then greet the protocol droid Emmie. However, in the game, the main entrance to the castle is permanently closed and cannot be accessed. The only way to get to the point where the crew seek help to get BB-8 back to the Resistance is by climbing up the castle. When the crew reaches the top of the second level of the castle, the cutscene shows the crew outside the entrance to the castle when greeting Emmie. After the crew leaves, the protocol droid GA-97 is hiding from onlookers to pick up information on BB-8. The cutscene then cuts to Kylo Ren and the First Order commander aboard the Finalizer just above Takodana. The First Order commander updates Ren with the location of BB-8 and asks permission to pursue. Ren only nods, not saying a word but clenching his fist tight."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Attack on Takodana"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the crew leaves Maz's Castle, Rey makes a welcoming statement that she has never eaten much of the food that was in the castle, seeing how hungry she must have been while living the scavenger life back on Jakku. It may seem unreal to some other players, but Rey also makes a remark about how she could barely afford to eat sand with the money Unkar Plutt gives her from her job as a scavenger, since she wouldn't eat anything other than what she is given. Unkar overhears this as he approaches Maz's Castle with his team of scavengers and lets Rey know about it. Rey asks how Unkar managed to travel to Takodana and Unkar says he has his connections and put an Imperial homing device on the Millennium Falcon while calling the ship a scrap heap. Han, seeming offended by Unkar's words, picks a fight with Unkar and his scavengers, with Rey and Finn to aid Han. After the fight, Rey sees BB-8 going somewhere else and asks where while Emmie brings in security to take Unkar Plutt away. Afterwards, everyone sees red lights in the sky, and Finn realizes that the First Order has fired their ultimate weapon and is destroying planets within its reach. First Order TIE fighters are then sent to Takodana and attack Maz's Castle and different parts of Takodana, targetting civilians as well. When the First Order attacks Maz's Castle, Finn picks up the lightsaber instead of Rey. A YT-2400 light freighter will land on a platform near Maz's Castle while in free roam or during a mission. After battling several First Order militia on Takodana, Finn, Han and Chewie are cornered until a squadron of Resistance X-Wing starfighters appear in the distance above the ocean behind Maz's Castle. A brief shout of joy from Poe is heard as the X-Wings attack the TIE fighters and enemy forces on the ground."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "BB-8 then appears with a hologram of General Leia Organa, who tells Han that he's \"in the thick of it\" just like old times. Han, surprised by Leia's appearance, asks her how she got to him, and Leia says the Resistance has spies like the First Order thanks to the assistance of the droids C-3PO and GA-97. However, in the hologram with Leia, when C-3PO appears, his red arm is omitted and not seen in a darker color like Leia's clothing. Finn and Poe greet each other, happy to see they are both unscathed. Poe even compliments Finn on the Resistance jacket, even though it was originally Poe's before Finn found it in the wreckage of the TIE fighter they used to fly out of the Finalizer back on Jakku. Since Poe complimented Finn on him wearing Poe's Resistance jacket, Poe lets Finn keep it. Later, Han, Chewie, Poe and Finn board the Millennium Falcon and make the jump to hyperspace en route to Starkiller Base, a weapon similar to the Death Star, that destroyed the Hosnian system before the battle on Takodana. Leia debriefs the crew on Starkiller Base and how the Resistance base could be the next target for the First Order. Leia says she needs someone to infiltrate the base and set charges to the main thermal oscillator to destroy it. Finn offers to help with the mission since he was stationed on the base on a sanitation job, and Poe agrees to help. Han makes an understatement that he might have to go along with the idea, but Poe and Leia play it off as Han's answer to proceed with the mission."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Arriving on Starkiller Base"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They attack enemy ships and Star Destroyers above the planet before making the lightspeed jump past the planetary shield protecting the planet from ships not using lightspeed. Han Solo tries the jump for lightspeed after Finn complains of trying hyperspace again since they jumped to hyperspace from inside the main hanger on the Eravana, and the crew gets past the planetary shield and lands on the planet and infiltrate the base. Once inside the planetary shield, the First Order commander updates Kylo Ren on the Falcon landing on the base and asks Ren if he could send a detachment to investigate the matter while both of them watch the battle above Starkiller Base. Ren denies the commander's permission and states that he will handle it by himself. Once inside the base, the main crew disables the planetary shield to allow the Resistance to enter the planet and attack the thermal oscillator. Afterwards, the crew sets charges inside the oscillator and set them off.

Ren then advances towards Finn and Rey. Finn tries to fight back but is knocked unconscious by Ren. Rey picks up the lightsaber, fights Ren one last time, defeats him, and climbs aboard the Millennium Falcon, taking Finn with her. Once Starkiller Base is destroyed, the Falcon is in space away from the explosion. Leia congratulates Rey on returning the information of Skywalker from BB-8 to the Resistance with the help of R2-D2. Leia states that the battle may be over, but the war rages on and that she needs help and hope, but Rey reassures Leia that if Skywalker is out there, they will find him.
