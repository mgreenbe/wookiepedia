Death Watch cobbled their training droids together from parts of destroyed droids of various models, including many originating from the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Battle droid 513 specifically was composed of the body of an LR-57 combat/retail droid, parts from a B1-series battle droid and an LM-432 crab droid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Death Watch would use 513 and its reassembled comrades for target practice, until the arrival of Jedi Padawan, Ahsoka Tano and her Astromech droid, R2-D2, the latter of which would convince 513 and its fellow droids to rebel against their masters, resulting in an firefight during which 513 was destroyed by Bo-Katan Kryze while his compatriots fled."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having been reassembled from the remains of Confederate battle droids, 513 was solely designed by the Mandalorian extremist organization, Death Watch to act as a form of target practice for its members during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While operating at an outpost on Carlac, one of Death Watch's soldiers utilized 513 for target practice, utilizing his wrist rocket to heavily damage the droid and cause him to fall over, all the while crying out in agony as the soldier that shot him laughed at his awareness of the situation. Later that night, while the leader of Death Watch, Pre Vizsla was meeting with the former Separatist Lux Bonteri and Jedi padawan Ahsoka Tano, 513 would encounter his eventual savior, an astromech droid identified as R2-D2, who had been ordered by a pair of Death Watch soldiers to repair their droids so they could be utilized for target practice again. Acknowledging the droid's orders, 513 and the other droids began to surround Artoo, begging to be reassembled by the astromech."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Proceeding to repair every one of the Death Watch's droids, 513 expressed his gratitude to the astromech, asking if there was anything the droids could do for Artoo in return. By this time, Ahsoka and Bonteri had witnessed the Death Watch launch an unprovoked attack on the native people of Carlac, protesting the mandalorian's slaughter and as a result were taken hostage and sentenced to be executed. Witnessing Death Watch return with his masters in captivity, Artoo requested for 513's aid in rescuing his friends to which 513 questioned how such an attempt could be executed. Artoo explained his plan and in response 513 rallied the other target droids to their cause. By the time Artoo's rescue attempt was put into place, 513 had gathered the Death Watch's droids to aid his newfound companion, launching a massive firefight against Death Watch and creating a sufficient diversion to allow Artoo and its masters to escape the Death Watch. As the battle continued, 513 was mounted by Bo-Katan Kryze who destroyed the droid with several direct shots to his body before pursuing the escaping prisoners."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Originally a standard LR-57 combat/retail droid, 513 had lost both his right arm and right leg, which his Mandalorian masters had replaced with that of a B1-series battle droid and LM-432 crab droid, respectively. 513 also had a deep-toned vocabulator, in which he could speak in Galactic Basic, and was capable of shooting blue ion blasts from his arm-mounted double laser cannon. 513's service under Death Watch soon gave the droid a developed personality, able to understand the horrors of being constantly destroyed and rebuilt for the pleasure of its captures and even pleading for help after encountering R2-D2. This unique personality was later showcased further as 513 was able to accompany its newfound compatriot in attacking Death Watch, causing a diversion long enough to allow R2-D2 to escape Carlac with his masters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
