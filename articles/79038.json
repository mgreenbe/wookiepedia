LCQ-4 quad laser cannons were considered to be the gold standard of laser cannon design; they fired alternating bolt patterns to deal significantly more damage than standard cannons and yet also maintaining formidable accuracy. The LCQ-4's main flaw was its prodigious power consumption, which Merr-Sonn downplayed in marketing the weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
