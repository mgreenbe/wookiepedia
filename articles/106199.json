Like all Hoojibs, Plif had the ability to telepathically communicate with other sentient species. He also possessed the ability to partially perceive the thought processes of lower-order non-sentient species, such as Sliviliths. Communication with such creatures was practically impossible, however, and the only mental impressions Plif could perceive from one were in the forms of vague, emotional images. Possessing a sharp mental acuity, Plif was the spokesmind for his Hoojib tribe of Arbra, and was commonly regarded as their unofficial leader."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As their leader, Plif founded a strong support base for an Arbran government, and, as such, Arbra became one of the founding members of the Alliance of Free Planets, the short-lived successor to the Alliance to Restore the Republic. In his role as de facto head of state, Plif actively participated in military actions against the forces of the Galactic Empire, the Nagai, and the Tofs. He was constantly paired up with Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker in commando raids and expeditions during the Nagai\u2013Tof War tour of duty, and even led his fellow Hoojibs into battle on several occasions. When the Alliance became the New Republic, Plif continued to represent the Hoojibs' interests to the new government."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life and career"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hoojib male Plif was born on Arbra, a forest world that was home to caves filled with powerful geothermal rods which drew energy from the planet core. As Hoojibs fed from energy, the caves not only provided shelter, but food. Growing up in these dangerous caves, Plif became the de facto leader of the Hoojibs, despite the lack of a formal government. Like all Hoojibs, he could communicate telepathically with other sentient species. During the Imperial Period, Plif's people were driven out of their caves by the Slivilith, an extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong creation that was accidentally pulled into Arbra's atmosphere. Seeking warmth, the Slivilith drove Plif's tribe out of their cave, depriving them of regular food and safety, and forcing them to roam the planet in a search for alternatives."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Civil War"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Alliance lands"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the run from the Galactic Empire following Lord Darth Vader's attack on their Echo Base on Hoth, a team of Rebel Alliance surveyors, led by Leia Organa and Chewbacca, landed on Arbra in 3 ABY in order to judge the planet's suitability as a base of operations. When nightfall came, Plif and his band of Hoojibs stole into the Alliance camp and began gnawing away at the foreigners' equipment. The operation was going smoothly until a stray Hoojib started to feast upon the protocol droid C-3PO's knee, which alerted the droid to the actions of the natives. In a panic, he triggered the camp's alarms, waking everybody. When the Rebels tried to power up their weapons and security devices, they found that the Hoojibs had completely drained them of power. In a knee-jerk reaction, Organa ordered Chewbacca to apprehend the fleeing Hoojibs, but the towering Wookiee was only able to catch one: Plif."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Plif astonished his captors when he began to communicate with them telepathically. He explained his tribe's actions, and began to justify them to Organa. As he was telling his tale, the encampment was attacked by the Slivilith. Concentrated Alliance fire forced the monster to retreat, but not for long. Plif hurriedly finished his tale, which prompted Organa to formulate a plan. The Hoojibs would gather at the mouth of the main cave and taunt the Slivilith, while the Rebels would bombard him with javelins. The plan worked, although the Slivilith was not stopped. Eventually pushing him back into the cave, the Rebels continued their attack. At one point, Plif was caught in the grasp of the creature, but Organa saved him with a precision shot from her blaster. The Alliance and the Hoojibs continued to fight the Slivilith to a standstill, until Chewbacca grappled with it and hurled it onto a collection of razor-sharp power rods, killing it in the process."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle over, and the caves reclaimed, Plif and his Hoojibs prepared to settle back into their standard lives. But certain members of the Alliance believed that the caves would make an ideal base of operations, and they prepared to move in. Outraged, Plif and the Hoojibs barred the Alliance from entering. He had fought for his home and his people, and despite the Alliance's help, he was not going to substitute one squatter for another. Organa saw the error of the Alliance's ways, and called her soldiers off. As they were leaving, Plif too realized that he had not been appreciative enough of the Alliance's aid. He called Organa and her troops back, and offered them anything they needed in order to set up their base within the caverns. This sealed an informal alliance between the Hoojibs and the Rebellion. Plif found himself in a position of importance, as he became Organa's unofficial advisor on Arbra."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Into the lair of the Darker"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Through adversity and incident, Haven Base persisted. The Alliance continued to launch successful operations from there, and was able to work cooperatively with Plif's Hoojibs. One day, however, an Alliance member broke Hoojib taboo. The astromech droid R2-D2, acting on his own analysis, ventured into the deep and dark caverns that led to Grotto City, the capital city of an extinct Arbran race. The Hoojibs had always regarded it as a place of great evil and had never entered it. Deciding that the safety of his allies was more important than outmoded taboo, Plif enlisted the help of C-3PO, Chewbacca, and a small team of Hoojibs, including Fuffle, and set off into the caves. Eventually, the team encountered an energy shield, which nevertheless let them pass through unfettered. On the other side was the ancient Grotto City, which filled the entire cavern. Wandering the streets, Plif and his team found R2-D2\u2014albeit dismembered. It was then that the Darker revealed himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Darker was a Force manifestation that had driven the original Arbrans off the planet. They had trapped him inside Grotto City with the very same energy field that the team had passed through earlier. Before the Darker was able to apprehend them, Plif and the Hoojibs ran off in search of assistance back at Haven base, leaving C-3PO and Chewbacca behind. Before they were able to escape, the Darker imbued them with uncontrollable fear, which effectively immobilized them. Plif himself started clawing at the walls of the cavern, having lost all semblance of his former levelheadedness. Eventually though, due to the courage of Chewbacca, the Darker's powers faltered, which reverted the Hoojibs to their former state. Now angered, instead of afraid, they launched a concerted attack on the Darker, distracting him long enough for Chewbacca to get through to him and hurl him into the energy screen. The Darker's negative energy was so great that it completely obliterated both the Darker and the field, allowing the small band to escape."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Incident at Kabray"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Alliance began their search for a rumored new Imperial superweapon, they sought information from operative Tay Vanis. Vanis was constantly on the run, but he had left information for the Rebellion at Kabray Station, where a reception for the Imperial Governor was being held. General Carlist Rieekan dispatched Organa and Commander Luke Skywalker to recover the data, and Plif volunteered his services as a mind-reader."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was the first time that Plif and his band of Hoojibs had been offworld. The experience did not phase him, however, as upon entering the reception at the space station, he severely reprimanded an announcer for questioning his nonexistent authority. Skywalker requested that Plif's team scour the function and eat the energy out of the Imperial Stormtroopers' weapons, which they did quickly, quietly, and effectively. After declining the advances of a pack of Zeltrons, one of whom asked Plif if his species was \"any fun,\" Skywalker and Plif started searching the governors' private quarters for Vanis' data. They eventually found it, but at the same time, overheard of a plot to poison the Imperial Governor. Thanks to a distraction during a musical performance later in the evening, Skywalker was able to avert the murder."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Alliance of Free Planets"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Expedition into uncharted lands"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, the Alliance was able to topple the Empire at Endor, where Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader died on the same day. This was the first threshold on the Alliance's path to becoming the dominant Galactic Government, and the combined forces of the Rebellion had reached it. Arbra, represented by Plif, became one of the founding worlds of the newly formed Alliance of Free Planets, which in turn solidified a form of government for Arbra itself. Plif, however, instead of serving merely as a politician, delved deep into the thick of the action, joining in on Alliance expeditions and diplomatic missions. One such mission involved journeying to Iskalon with Luke Skywalker. Skywalker had been to Iskalon during the war, and had been present when the place was bombed into submission by the Empire. After arriving, Plif marveled at the sheer amount of water. While investigating the bombed out city of Pavillion, Plif and Skywalker encountered Rik Duel, Dani, and Chihdo, confidence artists who were scavenging the remains of Iskalon. Skywalker had encountered them before, but Plif found them to be utterly immoral and insensitive to the plight of the Iskalonians. Ironically, the Iskalonians attacked the offworlders, though Skywalker was able to subdue them. Unfortunately, they were unable to convince Mone, the Inleshat leader of the Iskalonians, that the Alliance of Free Planets was any better than the Empire. Despite this failure, the Chuhkyvi Kiro joined Skywalker in order to help him with his recruiting efforts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Plif's next diplomatic mission of peace was to Shawken, a planet abundant in energy. Duel, Dani, and Chihdo were brought along, as well as Kiro. Upon reaching the planet, Skywalker and Plif engaged in negotiations with Santor, the foremost inhabitant of Shawken. Fortunately for the Shawkenese, the Imperial occupation had been relatively peaceful, and they were more trusting of the new Alliance. Plif, Skywalker, and Kiro were led to Santor's residence to discuss terms, while the others ventured into the newly discovered catacombs of Shawken. Skywalker, however, suspected that Duel and his gang would attempt to rob the Shawkenese blind, a thought which outraged Kiro. The young Chuhkyvi stormed after Duel and his friends, accidentally activating the Shawken Device, an ancient weapon of total destruction. Plif and Skywalker raced to stop the device, but it was Kiro who selflessly destroyed the weapon, almost at the cost of his own life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following his diplomatic exploits, Plif aided in the investigation of mysterious energy balls that had arisen in the Endor system. He and a select group of Hoojibs joined General Han Solo, C-3PO, and R2-D2 on Solo's Millennium Falcon, as they ventured out towards one of the balls. Suddenly, the energy locked onto the Falcon, and transported it to an unknown destination. Crash-landing on an uncharted planet, Solo introduced himself to the populace by shooting a group of raiders who were trying to apprehend a young couple. The raiders fled, and Solo discovered he had just saved the Prince and Princess of two separate planetary governments. Meanwhile, Plif and his Hoojib cohorts began researching the energy that had imbued itself in the ship's systems. With the help of Solo's knowledge, they were able to determine that the Vizier, Marius, had been using the energy balls to supply the bandits and stage a coup in order to take control of the planet. Solo was able to avert the crisis, and the group returned to the Alliance's temporary residence on Endor."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Nagai-Tof War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Plif soon came under the command of several Hoojib operatives that worked under Alliance leader Mon Mothma. Nagai warriors recently captured following the Skirmish on Kabray had been transported back to Endor so that they could be interrogated. Plif and his team spent an extensive amount of time around the prisoners trying to glean the Nagai's thoughts with their telepathic abilities. Plif was unable to learn anything of strategic value initially, but his team continued to search the Nagai's brains to discover their upcoming plans. Eventually, Plif and his group were able to discover that the Nagai were planning to attack the Alliance's base on Endor. The Alliance tried to evacuate but were too late, and a climactic battle ensued. The Alliance defeated the Nagai, and Plif continued to work with his Hoojib companions to find a way to defeat the building threat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Plif attended a party on Zeltros to celebrate the planet's admission into the Alliance. Skywalker, Solo, and Organa were all in attendance as well. Skywalker and Plif left halfway through to discuss the impending threat of the Nagai. Coincidentally, the party turned sour when a force of Nagai raiders attacked Zeltros, and took all the party goers, including the Zeltronian King and Queen, hostage. At the same time, oblivious to the Nagai attack, a band of Hiromi soldiers took Plif and Skywalker hostage, and imprisoned them in the palace kitchen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their imprisonment did not last long. After the simultaneous Nagai and Hiromi attacks, the Tofs, ancient enemies of the Nagai, landed on Zeltros. Barging into the kitchen, they took the Hiromi hostage and took control of the situation. Plif was able to get free and save Organa from the Tofs, and then returned to aid Skywalker in his fight against the remaining invaders. The Hiromi chose to side with Skywalker, and together, they drove the Tofs off-planet. It was at this point that Skywalker decided to take the fight to them. Based on intelligence from a captured Tof, Skywalker determined that several captured Zeltrons from the battle were being stored on the Tof battleship Wayfarer. For the final time, Plif joined with Skywalker, and the Hiromi, and participated in the raid with his fellow Hoojibs. The Zeltrons were saved, and the Alliance began to gear up for the final phase of the war, on Saijo. Though present at the briefing for the Saijo operation, Plif did not participate.

He was not afraid to go into combat for the Alliance, despite the lack of a formal commission.
