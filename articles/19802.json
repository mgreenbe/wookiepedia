The user's strength could affect the range and power of the weapon. Depending on the construction of the bow, as well as the user's strength, the maximum range of a bow was roughly 66 meters. However, bows that where made for non-humans, such as the Sakiyan Pulley bow, could propel an arrow much farther, and with far more force than bows built for humans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Ruusan campaign, the Jedi Petja used a bow, despite the availability of modern blasters.

However, many Ewoks still died from Imperial counterfire. Even Boba Fett used a bow when hunting Kardue'sai'Malloc, better known as The Butcher of Montellian Serat. He knew his opponent had highly-sensitive sensor equipment that would detect any of his \"normal\" weapons. Similarly, bows could be seen on high-tech planets used for sport."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
