It was responsible for providing specialized enforcers and muscle to assist in the Bureau's operations. Usually, Enforcement personnel were seconded to the Investigations branch, but they occasionally worked with Internal Affairs. Unlike other branches within the Commission for the Preservation of the New Order, Enforcement hired outside beings who were not members of the Commission, or even loyal to the New Order. This move prompted a keen interest from Internal Affairs, as they believed that using such indoctrinated personnel was a security risk. However, the policy had positive side effects; it increased the talent pool from which Enforcement was able to draw its operatives, and well as allowing operatives with no COMPNOR ties to conduct missions that would could not be linked to the Commission. It also oversaw bounties offered by the Imperial military and intelligence forces and made sure they were conducted with discretion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
