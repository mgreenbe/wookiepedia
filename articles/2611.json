It was during the time of the Empire and the Civil War when the Rebellion noticed that the system was both near the the sector capital of Dakshee, as well as the sector's frontier to Haldeen and the Kliap sectors, so it would make an ideal location for a secret relay station for transmitting \"psyprop\" both to the capital, and other Rebel bases."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1 BBY the Rebels started constructing the base while most of the world and personnel were underground.

Although Katarn's troops suffered heavy casualties, and Katarn himself was seriously wounded, he emerged victorious and was celebrated as an Imperial hero.

The door was set into quick-drying permacrete, and unlocked by a number pad. Next to it was an obvious camera, as well as a hidden tiny pinhead lens. The metallic door led to two airlocks, the second being a backup in case the first was destroyed by a meteor. The first room after the locks opened to an underground corridor dug by a mole miner, branching to other passages."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
