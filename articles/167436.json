Goodvalor was, in fact, a fictional naval officer of the Galactic Republic, the Mandalorians' opposing faction in the Mandalorian Wars, based on the \"heroics\" of the Snivvian crook and entrepreneur Marn Hierogryph at the Battle of Serroco. Hierogryph and his Trandoshan cohort, Slyssk, commandeered a Republic troop transport landed on Serroco as Mandalorian missiles raced toward the planet's surface, incidentally saving half a battalion in the process. Thus, the character of Goodvalor was born, as was \"Commander True,\" the captain's first officer who was based upon Slyssk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Goodvalor's Z-band broadcasts, where he was voiced by Marn Hierogryph's brother, sought to dishearten the Mandalorians and cause some of them to reconsider their allegiance in the conflict. On one occasion Commander True, rather than Captain Goodvalor, made a broadcast to the Z-band, claiming that the captain was too preoccupied with the numerous Mandalorian turncoats that had joined the Republic following his previous message to broadcast himself that day."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During this time, Mandalorian warrior and signals expert Koblus Sornell made use of the Z-band to keep her fellow Neo-Crusaders informed of the war effort, urging them to disregard Goodvalor's \"gabble\" but to still listen to the Z-band to stay informed of bombing traffic. During their invasion of Zongorlu, the Mandalorians came across a small room containing a directional transmitter, where \"Goodvalor\" had been sending his broadcasts from, though he himself had departed before the Mandalorians had arrived. Goodvalor soon resumed his messaging, proposing a one-time ceasefire deal with the Mandalorians."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Z-band's first and only appearance is in the short story \"Interference,\" authored by John Jackson Miller and originally released to members of the Hyperspace Star Wars fan club in 2008. \"Interference\" serves as a tie-in to the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic comic book series, also written by Miller, set between the series' fourth and fifth volumes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
