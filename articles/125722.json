Simon stood at one meter tall, wore a piece of orange hooded clothing that covered his chest and head, with holes for his ears and face.

After the code is entered, Simon would appear on any stretch of land that the player is overlooking. The color of the plumes on Simon's headpiece are dependent on the team color of the player he is summoned by. They can be blue, red, green, yellow, purple, gray, orange, or cyan. Simon's model and profile image are identical to that of Chief Chirpa, who appears in multiple campaigns in the game."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike most of the game's other cheat codes, \"Simonsays\" was not mentioned in Prima Games' strategy guide for Galactic Battlegrounds, and was instead revealed on the LucasArts website.
