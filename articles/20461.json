Toward the end of the galactic conflict, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Captain Gregar Typho ventured to the world to try to persuade President Vuul to ally Bri'ahl with the Galactic Republic. However, a resistance made up of activists dressed in clone trooper armor provided by a supportive Count Dooku planned to infiltrate the Presidential palace and assassinate Senator Amidala and Vuul. However, the misadventures of C-3PO and R2-D2 caused the destruction of the entire rebellion, thus saving the lives of two important politicians. Without the interference of the activists, Vuul seemed inclined to agree to Amidala's suggestion. Bri'ahl probably became part of the Republic, and in several months, most likely the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
