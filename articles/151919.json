Due to the attack, the passengers of the beleaguered ship were ordered to evacuate. The evacuation was carried out in an orderly fashion, with the passengers assigned to various life pods by number. During the evacuation, the conductor was still directing the band, and inquired as to whether or not they should play another song. The maestro was asked by the mollusk musicians if the ship had life pods large enough to support them, to which the insectoid replied that such a design feature was assumed. The band leader was interrupted by a boarding call that announced the insectoid's assigned life pod. The conductor bid the band good luck and hurried to evacuate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, the conductor was reunited with the band aboard a Galactic Republic rescue frigate.
