Numbering between four and twenty vessels, they were comprised mostly of corvettes or similar. Skirmish lines were intended to engage larger starships and starfighters. The use of skirmish lines diminished with the rise in popularity of the TIE Series of starfighters, but regained their status as the Alliance to Restore the Republic equipped themselves with better armaments. Tie squadrons used skirmish lines as mobile cover, while the line itself provided supporting fire to the starfighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
