At some point, he became a member of a Jedi force that was garrisoned on the planet Almas outside the Almas Sith fortress to keep the Believers, a Sith cult that operated in the Cularin system, from entering the fortress, which had previously served as a Believer base. While the majority of the fortress's Jedi guards were stationed to the north of the building, Vorlocca was one of six Jedi who were assigned to protect the facility's south entrance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a sandstorm circa 20 BBY, the Chevin slaver Phylus Mon, the Dark Jedi Karae Nalvas, and a number of Mon's minions traveled to the south entrance to access the fortress, where they planned to search for the secrets of the creation of ancient Sith warriors known as Sith battlelords. Mon's forces attacked Vorlocca and the other five Jedi guards; during the ensuing fight, Vorlocca and the Jedi Tresten Agai'i, K'kur, and Milak Sonloam were killed, while the other two Jedi defenders were captured, allowing Mon and Nalvas to enter the fortress.

He was chosen to guard the south entrance of the Sith fortress because of his exceptional abilities, as the Jedi knew less about the south entrance than they did about the building's other entrances.

In the adventure, the player-characters, who roleplay as the search party that discovers Vorlocca's corpse, find a number of individuals inside the Sith fortress who have had their Force essences separated from their bodies as a result of Phylus Mon's attempts to carry out a ritual relating to the creation of Sith battlelords. It is then possible for the players to ask the Force ghost Darsin if Vorlocca's body had also been separated from its Force essence, to which the spirit replies is unlikely. It is also possible for the player-characters to take Vorlocca's body with them when they leave the fortress. If they choose to do so, the cadaver is then loaded onto a shuttle with the player-characters and is taken to the Almas Academy, a Jedi academy that was located on Almas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
