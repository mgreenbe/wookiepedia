Later, while being introduced to Chan Dash by Den Dhur, the Jedi Jax Pavan experienced a sudden surge of Force power within him, something far stronger than he had ever felt before. Within this flood of power, he experienced a metaphysical vision of the entire galactic whirlpool and at the same time felt connected to it. Following this experience, he recognized that the Force itself had granted him a gift, a connection to the great unifying gestalt that Jedi Masters referred to as the Cosmic Force.
