Throughout the conflict, the members of the Jedi Order served as commanders and generals of the Grand Army and, thus, they served alongside their clone soldiers on many occasions. However, the covert Sith plot to seize control of the galaxy, masterminded by the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, effectively caused the clones to betray and destroy the Republic that they were sworn to protect with their lives. Sidious, in his public guise as Chancellor Palpatine, issued Order 66 to the clone troopers on the eve of the Clone Wars' end."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The contingency order declared that all Jedi were traitors to the Republic and, hence forward, subject to summary execution.

The project was discovered by Darth Tyranus, a former Jedi Master who turned to the dark side of the Force and became the Sith apprentice of Darth Sidious. Tyranus then murdered Sifo-Dyas at Sidious' behest, and the two Sith Lords took over the project for their own ends."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the cloners on Kamino were able to begin their task, they required an individual subject to serve as the army's genetic template. Tyranus, who had been ordered by Sidious to both search for an ideal candidate amongst the galaxy's deadliest mercenaries and eliminate a deranged former Jedi named Komari Vosa, devised a plan to accomplish the two objectives at the same time. Thus, he placed a five million credit reward on the capture of Vosa, who had become the leader of the Bando Gora. Whether she was dead or alive after her capture was irrelevant as the prize was the same either way. Among the mercenaries who received a special invitation from Tyranus was Jango Fett, a former Mandalorian who sought to make a living as a bounty hunter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Fett successfully tracked and defeated Komari Vosa in combat, Tyranus personally congratulated the hunter and, in addition to the reward money, offered a substantial amount of more credits if Fett agreed to be cloned on Kamino. The purpose, as Tyranus revealed, was the creation of an army of clones, modified to grow at twice the rate of Human beings and programmed for absolute loyalty. Their training, supervised by Jango Fett, would turn them into perfect soldiers. After a moment of contemplation, Fett agreed to Tyranus' offer, but on the condition that the first clone would be given to him without any modifications."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before the gestation process began, the Kaminoans tampered with Fett's DNA to ensure that the clones were primarily dominated by behavioral genes that emphasized certain qualities such as loyalty, aggression, independence and discipline in order to guarantee that the army would be more docile and less independent than their template. Additionally, the Kaminoans increased their clones' lung capacity, decreased their reaction times and improved their stamina. Certain allergies and Fett's mild astigmatism were also removed from the genome. Kal Skirata, a former Mandalorian warrior who had been brought to Kamino to assist in the training of a special unit, concurred with the Kaminoans' rationale behind \"modified\" troopers; an \"unaltered\" Jango Fett was not the ideal infantry soldier."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kaminoans also considered but rejected making the clone troopers sterile per their standard procedure for clone army projects. Senior research geneticist Hali Ke cited examples of sterile Human clones created for Tarshan Ring Excavations and infiltration squads created for the Lords of Purala IV, where clone prototypes displayed much higher rates of mental instability, poor unit cohesion, an inability to adapt and think creatively, and decreased aggressiveness in battlefield simulations. The Kaminoans found separating this from \"Factor H\"\u2014the Human variable they deemed so essential to creating effective, aggressive soldiers\u2014impossible, and so eschewed sterile clones in the name of military effectiveness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Kaminoans first began the cloning procedure, they had produced twelve prototypes, designated Null-class Advanced Recon Commandos. Due to the extreme modifications to their physiology, only half of the test subjects survived the gestation process. However, the \"enhancements\" that were made to the Fett genome left the survivors handicapped with erratic behavior and an inclination toward disobedience. Disappointed with the unsatisfactory results of their wayward creations, the Kaminoans deemed the six prototypes complete failures and intended to terminate them. Kal Skirata's intervention, along with Fett's support, prevented the clones from being liquidated. As a result, Skirata was charged with training the prototypes as intelligence units."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Training"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the long-term commitment that was required in the creation of the clone army, Jango Fett took a hiatus from his bounty-hunting career to monitor the growth and training of his clones. His influence over the clone army's development extended into several areas, such as the resemblance between his Mandalorian armor and the their Phase I armor and the training that molded the clones into elite soldiers. One of his most significant contributions to the project, however, was his personal oversight of the Alpha-class Advanced Recon Commando, otherwise known as \"ARC troopers.\" The \"second generation\" ARC units were the Kaminoans' response to the failure of the Null-class. Unlike their precursors, the Alpha-class ARC troopers were more reliable for their loyalty to the Republic and willingness to serve under Jedi officers. They were, however, superior and more creative in comparison to the rank-and-file clone troopers, due to their unaltered level of independence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clones were decanted into birth cohorts of 32, and they trained, ate and slept alongside their batchers. These birth cohorts became the platoons clone troopers would fight in, having trained with their comrades literally from birth. Through the technological capability to accelerate the speed of a clone's physical growth, the Kaminoans successfully engineered fully grown clones in half of the time that real Humans required to reach maturity. As a result of the genetic modification that enhanced their growth process, the clone troopers aged at twice the rate of Human beings. At the age of ten, a clone was resembling a young Jango Fett in his early twenties, and was thus fit and prepared for combat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "All clone troopers received basic training in core military skills, such as weapons handling, marksmanship, drill, and other essentials. While Jango Fett personally handled the training of the Alpha-class ARC troopers, a specialized unit of clone commandos was commissioned as a median between the independent-minded ARC troopers and the more docile rank-and-file clone troopers. In order to ensure the overall success of the commandos project, Fett formed the Cuy'val Dar- a group composed of experienced Mandalorian mercenaries and even a few Journeyman Protectors. Though individual members of the group had their own unique training methods, as a whole, they separated the commandos into squads of four, which in turn created a strong sense of brotherhood amongst the commando squads. Clones that were fit to serve in leadership capacity possessed notable traits, such as a greater degree of independence and creativity, as exhibited by commanders like CC-2224, nicknamed \"Cody,\" and CT-65/91-6210, nicknamed \"Deviss.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As part of their education and psychological training, the clone troopers were required to adhere to the Command Code, a set of guidelines that governed a clone's behavior and every action.

The clone commandos were particularly susceptible to this outside influence since they experienced the most exposure to Mandalorians. Likewise, the Null-class ARC troopers were raised as Mandalorians by Kal Skirata. The use of Mando'a\u2014the native language of the Mandalorians\u2014began amongst the commandos and was gradually adopted by clone troopers of the rank-and-file stock. One particular feature of the Mandalorian culture that the clone army assimilated was the \"Jaig eyes,\" a mark of honor bestowed on soldiers for exceptional acts of bravery. ARC Captain Alpha-77 was commended with the Jaig eyes, as was Clone Captain CT-7567, nicknamed \"Rex.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Mandalorian influence was especially strong on the clone commandos, the mainstream of the clone army held loyalty and obedience to the Galactic Republic as the overriding priority above all other concerns or interests. The connection between the clone army and its Mandalorian heritage was greatly strained when Spar, a renegade Alpha-class ARC trooper, deserted the Republic and organized the Mandalorian Protectors on the side of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The heavy casualties that the clone troopers endured due to the involvement of Spar and his Mandalorians at New Bornalex and Kamino caused the clones to develop a strong sense of enmity toward the Mandalorians, whom they now regarded as enemies of the Republic. The troopers of the 2nd Airborne Company were openly hostile with Omega Squad because of the commandos' Mandalorian \"upbringing.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The end of the Mandalorian culture's influence over the clone army commenced with the production of new generations of clone troopers, grown and trained away from Kamino and under direct Republic supervision. The first wave of clones that eventually supplanted the original troopers were engineered through Spaarti technology, which was most notable for the fact that it developed fully matured clones in one year (as opposed to the longer Kaminoan method of ten years). The decline of Mandalorian influence was further accelerated when the Galactic Empire's Stormtrooper Corps became dominated by enlisted troopers and clones based on different genomes, which thus reduced the remaining Fett clones to a minority status."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Aberrations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the Kaminoans' dedication to perfection when it came to their work, the cloning process produced a minority of clones with genetic abnormalities. Eye color proved particularly prone to variation, while many clones would have subtly different facial features to their fellow batchers. In some 3.5 percent of clones in each batch, however, genetic variations were so extreme that reconditioning was required, a euphemism that could include anything from genetic therapy to termination. One instance included a company of clones that possessed less than 20/20 vision. They mysteriously disappeared in the late hours of the night and were never seen again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Terminations were largely halted after the Jedi took a more active role overseeing clone trooper training during the Clone Wars, with aberrant clones largely being shunted into support roles. One genetically aberrant failure, 99, was relegated to janitorial responsibilities, since he was physically incapable of military service. These procedures would still occasionally miss aberrants, such as the \"Mad Clone of Kaikielius,\" who avoided being noticed during his growth and training only to go berserk during the Kaikielius campaign of the Clone Wars and murder his batchers in the belief that he was in a training simulation where his comrades had been replaced by disguised droids."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Clone Wars begin"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, ten years after the start of the clone trooper program, the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi tracked Jango Fett to the remote world of Kamino in the Outer Rim Territories. Much to his surprise, however, his arrival in Tipoca City was greeted with great anticipation from the Kaminoan cloners. Prime Minister Lama Su assumed that Kenobi had been sent by the Jedi Order to obtain a progress report on the Republic's clone army, and thus, he never realized that Kenobi was oblivious to the existence of the clones. Nevertheless, Kenobi inspected the clones for himself and learned from Lama Su that 200,000 units were prepared for deployment; another million were nearly combat-ready as well. When Kenobi attempted to apprehend Jango Fett, the bounty hunter escaped to the Separatist world of Geonosis.

With his new authority, Chancellor Palpatine accepted Kamino's clone army on behalf of the Senate, and thus, the Grand Army of the Republic was officially formed.

The members of the Jedi Order were commissioned as officers in the Grand Army of the Republic. Under the leadership of their Jedi commanders and generals, the clones engaged the Separatists on numerous battlefields; from Christophsis, Teth and Ryloth, to Hypori, Jabiim, and Kamino itself. Despite the overall combat effectiveness of the clone troopers, their numbers steadily decreased throughout the war by attrition, an increasing rate of casualties, and their own accelerated aging process, Due to the clones maturation process, clone life expectancy was considerably short; many clones exhibited characteristics of far older men such as grey hair, receding hairlines, baldness and wrinkles. By 19 BBY, roughly three years after the first engagement at Geonosis, only two-thirds of the first generation clone troopers were still alive."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "A face and a name"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though often viewed as the \"flesh and blood\" equivalent of battle droids, clone troopers possessed a limited capacity for individuality. They were bred for no other purpose than combat, but nevertheless they developed as individuals under the guidance of their Jedi officers.

Clone Commander CC-5052, nicknamed \"Bly,\" felt that the Jedi were in command because they were the best in the Grand Army of the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clone troopers were officially identified by sets of letters and numbers. Every soldier's wrist was scannable and contained an identifying code, which displayed information such as designation, rank and battles fought. Less than a year after the Clone Wars began, many clones adopted nicknames to complement their official designations with the approval of the Jedi. Captain Rex speculated that efficiency was the reason clones had been permitted to have \"names,\" due to the difficulty of distinguishing genetically identical soldiers at an individual level. Another way that the Jedi fostered individuality in the clone troopers was through example; some clones respected their Jedi officers enough to emulate their leadership styles. Rex developed a sense of impulsiveness during his service under Anakin Skywalker. Cody had a strict adherence to procedure, a trait that was appreciated by Obi-Wan Kenobi. The camaraderie that gradually developed between Jedi and clones was mirrored through others as well, including Aayla Secura and Bly, or Plo Koon and the clones of Wolfpack.

Ordinary, standard-issue clone troopers were programmed to be absolutely subservient, but a few of them developed too much as individuals to the point where said loyalty was overridden. Examples included Clone Sergeant \"Slick,\" \"Ghost\" and Cut Lawquane. Tempted by thoughts of freedom and wealth, \"Slick\" became a spy for the Separatists while feigning loyalty to the Republic. He excused his treachery through his belief that the clones were enslaved, even though his actions caused the deaths of many of his \"brothers\" on Christophsis. Ghost, too, betrayed both the Republic and his fellow clones, selling his service to the Confederacy of Independent Systems in exchange for a way out of the war.

Even before the mass production of Phase II armor, many clones had been allowed to customize their Phase I armor in various ways, either with color or additional equipment.

When Kamino was twice threatened by Separatist invasion, both Cody and Rex expressed concern for the safety of \"their\" planet.

Rahm Kota, a well-respected and highly skilled Jedi General, was not so easily fooled by the clones' seemingly innocent nature. Regarded as a military genius on the battlefield, Kota concluded that clone troopers made inadequate soldiers. Real Humans were unhindered by the modifications that limited the clones, and thus they were ultimately more intelligent, intuitive and versatile than the clones.

This ultimately resulted in a law being passed via Senate decree late in the Clone Wars that confined military cloning to a few Republic facilities, as well as banning military-related cloning for all except closely regulated medical exemptions. The law also explicitly banned the purchase of sentient clones, sale of cloning equipment, or the employment of cloning specialists.

None of the Fett clones, especially the ones who served in the 501st, were able to reconcile themselves to the fact that they had been marginalized into a minority within the army that they once filled as a whole."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The diversity continued to spread throughout the ranks over the next decade as more male Humans were recruited from the Outer Rim Territories and trained as stormtroopers. By this time, the few remaining Fett clones that survived the Clone Wars still carried a strong sense of hatred for all troopers who did not originate from Jango Fett's template. Their animosity extended particularly toward enlisted troopers. Commander Cody, the clone who originally served under Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi, became bitter and nostalgic due to the significant decline in the military's operational effectiveness ever since the Empire increased the rate of recruitment for the stormtrooper ranks. Cody had an extremely low opinion of enlisted troopers and regarded them as \"idiots\" that lacked any sense of themselves or their surroundings. As a veteran of the Clone Wars who once hailed from the Grand Army of the Republic, Cody despaired over the quality of the Stormtrooper Corps, which he saw as an embarrassment to the legacy of a once truly remarkable military force."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even though Fett-based clones had largely been shelved, with cloning even being considered a clandestine science after the rise of the Empire, military-related cloning and research had not ceased. Various top-secret facilities conducted research on creating Force-sensitive prime clones, similar to the clones X1 and X2 from the Clone Wars. In addition, Grand Admiral Thrawn ended up making the discovery that using ysalamiri to sever a developing clone's connection to the Force resulted in the creation of mentally stable clones to be created in mere weeks, a discovery he later intended to use to his advantage during his actions against the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Armor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the development of the first generation of clones, Kaminoan armorsmiths forged Phase I battle armor; the military combat uniform of the clone troopers. The armor was loosely based on the design of Jango Fett's Mandalorian shock trooper armor. The most notable feature of Mandalorian influence in the armor's design was the helmet's distinctive T-shaped visor. The full uniform consisted of twenty plastoid armor plates, attached to a black body glove. Other aspects of the armor included the helmet's breath filter, a utility belt and the boots' high-traction soles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the beginning of the Clone Wars, Phase I battle armor used color to distinguish clone officers from each other and the rest of the rank-and-file stock. For instance, commanders were marked by yellow stripes; captains, lieutenants and sergeants were identified by red, blue and olive green respectively. However, this system of military uniformity was relaxed early in the war, and color was used in some cases to indicate unit affiliation instead of rank. Though many clone troopers maintained their armor in traditional white, other clones\u2014particularly officers\u2014customized their uniforms through color and design. In recognition of their achievements, some clones were allowed to add specific designs to their armor, such as a Mandalorian award known as \"Jaig eyes.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clone troopers who received specified training for various roles other than infantry were equipped with variant forms of Phase I battle armor. Clone pilots wore the same armor as regular troopers, but were distinguished by yellow markings and specialized full-face helmets.

The new armor was designed to be superior to its predecessor in every aspect; stronger, lighter and more adaptable. This advanced armor also possessed many specialist variations, suited to clones such as scout troopers, paratroopers and AT-RT drivers. But due to the rigors of war, Phase II battle armor was more battle-dented and mud-smeared than the Phase I precursor. The practice of color design and armor customization was carried over to the new armor as well.
