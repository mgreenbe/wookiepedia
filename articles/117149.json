Nestled within the market of Black Spire Outpost, Ronto Roasters was operated by butcher and noted podracing fan Bakkar, who decorated the establishment with a number of podracing flags and installed a modified podracer engine which hung from the ceiling at the restaurant's center. Bakkar's modified engine was used as a grill to cook large slabs of ronto meat, a family specialty going back four generations and part of his upbringing on Tatooine, and to roast whole nunas. Items were constantly rotated over the open fire by the former smelter droid known as 8D-J8, who served as the pitmaster and remained in the kitchen. Since thin cuts of meat tended to get dried out by the grill, they were flavored and turned into jerky, including jerky made from nuna turkey and luggabeast meat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The air around Ronto Roasters smelled of grilled meat, and the restaurant was a favorite of starship crews preparing for their next mission.
