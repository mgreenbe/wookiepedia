Just like the game guide to the original Battlefront, this strategy guide describes the movement, the combat basics, the gameplay concepts, the various modes of the game, the units and classes, the weapons and equipment, the vehicles and turrets, and all the locations and battlefields included in the game. However, unlike the previous book, this strategy guide also includes a walkthrough of the story mode called the Rise of the Empire Campaign that follows through some of the major battles of a retired clone trooper belonging to the 501st Legion. It shows the evolution of the clone troopers to the stormtroopers and the 501st Legion becoming known as \"Vader's Fist\" during the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Book Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fight the Star Wars battles any way you want to."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Detailed maps for all battlefronts, showing locations of Command Posts, vehicle spawn points, and support droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
