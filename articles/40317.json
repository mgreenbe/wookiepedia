He had at least two sons, and it was his hope that one would be trained as a Sith, and the other would be an officer in the military. One son was selected to be trained at the Sith Academy on Korriban by Darth Marr of the Dark Council, after which his family never heard from him again. The other son, Talos Drellik, joined the military - as an officer in the Imperial Reclamation Service, achieving the rank of lieutenant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Speaking to his patron, the Sith Lord who became Darth Nox, Talos remarked that once the cursing had stopped, his father had warmed to the idea of his serving in the Reclamation Service, which in Talos' view did an invaluable service to the Empire by rediscovering and preserving its history. His Sith brother, however, was referred to as an \"ungrateful little rat\" by their father, though Talos thought it was just his way of expressing grief at not hearing from him anymore."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
