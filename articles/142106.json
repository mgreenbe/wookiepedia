The monastery soon found itself the site of a large battle between Republic and Separatist forces. The battle raged up the mesa's cliff side, in which the Republic's primary weapon were standard AT-TE Walkers, which were used to climb up to the fortress. Upon reaching the top, Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano recovered the missing Huttlet. Later, Skywalker and Tano found the Twilight on an adjacent cliff, and used it to transport Rotta back to his father on Tatooine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in the war, Ziro the Hutt visited his father's hidden grave, located on the planet.
