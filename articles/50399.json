Han Solo, while watching an \"old\" holovid that depicted a heavily muscled Spathen with long glowing hair, recalled that it was fifteen years old, and that he had seen it in dozens of cheap clubs in the past. Bran Kemple, watching the same holovid, expressed doubt as to whether Spathen's muscles were \"real.\" Solo replied that he believed the muscles to be Spathen's, after Spathen had paid approximately two hundred credits for them, plus installation fees."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
