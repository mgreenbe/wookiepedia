The Star Wars Galaxies publish archives indicate that the weapon was added to the game either during the Combat Upgrade Version 0.122039 on May 5, 2005 or Publish 17.0 on May 26, 2005.

According to the Tech Specs: Pistols article published on March 2, 2007, the weapon was dedicated to players of the newly revamped medic profession following the release of the New Game Enhancements. However, this prerequisite was eventually removed. The weapon could be constructed using a number of different components and resources, including plumbum iron, non-ferrous metal, and chemicals. A couple Star Wars Galaxies reference guides feature the Alliance disruptor, including Star Wars Galaxies: The Total Experience: Prima Official Game Guide and Star Wars Galaxies: The Complete Guide: Prima Official Game Guide (2005). In Champions of the Force, the first set of the Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game released on August 19, 2008, the Alliance disruptor was introduced as a game card. The artwork for the Alliance disruptor illustration was completed by Erich Schreiner. Capitalization of the weapon's name was somewhat inconsistent between sources. The Total Experience: Prima Official Game Guide and The Complete Guide: Prima Official Game Guide fully capitalize the weapon as an Alliance Disruptor, as did its card for Champions of the Force. Star Wars Galaxies likewise capitalized the name in the weapon's title, but examining the pistol revealed a description which read, \"An Alliance disruptor.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
