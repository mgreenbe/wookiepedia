The chef's inspiration for the brown pudding was the mud of the world Mimban. He attributed its taste to using all-natural ingredients that produced a velvety-smooth, richly-flavored treat. The pudding had a white topping, which itself was topped with green nectrose crystals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point after the Battle of Takodana in 34 ABY, Tuggs included a recipe for Mimbanese Mudslide in his cookbook The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook, where he mentioned that he had no intention of going back to Mimban despite its inspiring such a dessert. He also acknowledged that while pudding might not seem like a gourmet option, he promised that the mudslide was nothing like the overprocessed \"glop\" one might find with ration packs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mimbanese Mudslide was introduced in the 2019 recipe book Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge: The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook, which was authored by Chelsea Monroe-Cassel and Marc Sumerak.
