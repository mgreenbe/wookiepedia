At some point after the Hosnian Cataclysm of 34 ABY, Lodain's mother had noticed Resistance presence around Batuu's ancient ruins, but his father had entreated to keep it quiet because of the First Order's stormtroopers deployed on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Months after the Hosnian Cataclysm, Lodain worked at Kat Saka's farm as a harvester of purple Surabat grain. He was the leader of a group of thirteen-year-old farmhands, including the human Shari, a Sullustan, and a Gungan. The group was surprised by the smuggler Izal Garsea's appearance when their former colleague Julen Rakab brought her to the farm. Garsea told them that she was in between jobs, and the group was impressed that she owned her own starship, the light freighter Meridian. When Shari and the Gungan entreated Garsea to stay at the farm, Lodain rebuffed Shari's suggestion smugly, pointing out that her grandparents needed somewhere to hide after the Clone Wars. Garsea then deescalated the argument, and the group ate together."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lodain later went with Garsea to fill canteens for the overtime workers at the farm's well. He was skeptical of her reason for being on Batuu and suspected she came for the Resistance.

Garsea shared Lodain's father's sentiment of keeping sightings of the Resistance quiet and listened to Lodain outline his aspirations of bravery and grandeur, advising that he fight for his relatives. Upon learning she had not chosen any family yet, Lodain offered that she could always choose the farmhands.
