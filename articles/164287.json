The economic center of the star system, which was ruled by the Heaven-earth corporation, Wind held nearly 60 percent of the system's wealth and had a large, bustling city that covered most of the world and contained most of its population, which was nearly half of that of the entire system's population. The remainder of the planet was a wasteland of deserts and lost ocean, housing scattered settlements repurposed from abandoned cities and towns. Over-exploited mineral mines dotted the planet surface, with an abandoned capital located just beyond Wind's main city."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One desert settlement was home to the Knights of Silver Dawn, a group of mercenaries who worked for profit, some of which went to supply their impoverished human community on Wind. Additionally, the Knights supplied other settlements in the wastelands of Wind, such as spring village. Water supply was not an issue for the Knights' home as it was originally established as an artificial oasis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Towards the end of the High Republic Era, new biological water-purifying technology relied on enigmatic tenebrae as its primary component. However, enigmatic tenebrae was a deadly biological hazard, a drop of which could pollute an entire oasis and poison a hundred thousand to death. Around 82 BBY, Wind's southern Light Han City had just switched to the new water-purifying equipment, and relied on the Knights to deliver a shipment of enigmatic tenebrae from Earth, the capital of the Heaven system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Li Yu, the leader of the Knights, thus sent the elite red apricot squad to handle the matter.
