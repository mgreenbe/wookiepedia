His colleague says that the sensor grid picked up a weird energy reading at the hangar. The first officer is dismissive, thinking that it is just a fluctuation in the city's power couplings. He thinks that it would be more appropriate to send a repair droid or a technician. While the underworld police officers debate about the insurgent danger to Coruscant, Beetoo plugs into the Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor's engine.
