Designed by Tee Riffle, the F-LER was a compact tug and cargo handler capable of flying in either realspace or atmospheres. If an YT-1300 was used as in freight-pusher mode, the F-LER could also be mounted at the front of the line of intermodal cargo containers to assist with guidance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While CEC's marketing department thought YT-1300 owners would be glad to fill the gap between the mandibles, nearly all commercial pilots found the F-LER impractical, because it prevented easy access to the freight-loading room. That lack of interest prompted the company to abandon production of the F-LER, which became extremely rare and highly valued by collectors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In spite of the F-LER's failure, several affiliates of CEC continued to manufacture small auxiliary craft for the YT-1300, such as the YT Dart."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
