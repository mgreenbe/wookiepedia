It was populated by Gamorreans, Weequay, Trandoshans, Nikto and other unpleasant crooks and creeps. She kept her little slave community right in the middle of her palace, in case she needed something. This is where Anakin Skywalker and Shmi Skywalker Lars lived until she lost a bet with Watto."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Her throne room was huge with an opening to go into the arena, to watch horrible deaths to unlucky visitors.

The base was also home to a lush garden filled with plants, fountains and birds which Moff Gromia employed as a private chamber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
