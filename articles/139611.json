Only Brevet Captain Myn Donos and \"Talon Twelve\" survived the initial volley of laser fire. After a short dogfight where Donos and \"Talon Twelve\" were pursued by a dozen TIE fighters each, Donos managing to shoot down three of them and \"Talon Twelve\"'s X-wing sustaining minor damage\u2014the lone TIE Interceptor that led Talon Squadron into the trap appeared once more. Donos discovered on a close pass inspection that it was a member of the 181st Imperial Fighter Group. The Interceptor pilot tried to get a targeting lock on \"Talon Twelve\" as Donos quickly tried to get behind. Both of them fired simultaneously. Donos' shot forced the Interceptor to disengage with damaged engines, but its shots landed hits on \"Talon Twelve\"'s X-wing causing it to break apart. \"Talon Twelve\" tried to eject, but her canopy initially jammed, prevented her from successfully escaping her doomed vessel. By the time her canopy broke loose, \"Talon Twelve\" was unconscious and her ejection seat shot into the side of a rift wall on the planet, killing her. With his whole squadron dead, Donos managed to survive the encounter and report back to his superiors, choosing to live only because he decided that he needed to inform the Talon Squadron members' families of the pilots' deaths."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Dissolution"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ambush at Graven Seven left Donos as the sole Talon Squadron survivor.
