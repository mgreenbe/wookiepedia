It only required a crew of one and could carry four passengers. The vessel had a hold that could carry eighty-two metric tons of cargo, as well as two months worth of consumables. A Class Three hyperdrive propelled the Scupper Bantoo through hyperspace, with a Class Fourteen module as a backup. The ship could achieve speeds of up to 750 kilometers per hour in atmosphere. The vessel was also mounted with one heavy blaster cannon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Scupper Bantoo was owned by a slave master and merchant who was based on Kal'Shebbol, the capital planet of the Kathol sector in the Outer Rim Territories. He attempted to keep the ship modernized, but the vessel had been considered obsolete since 12 BBY, and there was only so much he could do to improve the ship. When he was killed by an Aing-Tii ship while on a trading expedition, the vessel was acquired by his slave, the Bith Maddie Macatten. The Aing-Tii were known to despise slavers, and would often attack their ships when they encountered them. Macatten then took the ownership papers and simply flew the vessel out of the docking bay in which it was berthed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Striking out for the Kathol Outback, Macatten used the Scupper Bantoo as a merchant vessel, trading machine parts and luxury goods between the various colonies she found.
