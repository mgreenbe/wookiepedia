The satellite was used to reroute the control signal from the Droid Control Ship down to a droid base. Comm 4 was situated in orbit above Naboo and was protected by heavy shields projected by three slave satellites dispersed nearby. Comm 4 had several missile launchers to use in its defense if the shields were disrupted. The satellite was also protected by a number of droid starfighters. It was destroyed during an orbital assault by members of the Naboo resistance who were fighting back against the Trade Federation Droid Army. The destruction of Comm 4 temporarily shut down the base it controlled, allowing the resistance to assault it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Comm 4 satellite appears in a mission from the 2000 video game Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo.
