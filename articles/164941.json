Attaining the rank of Jedi Master, Honoran eventually retired from active field work and chose to teach at the Coruscant Jedi Temple's academy as an instructor. Educating his students with his extensive knowledge of political policy, Honoran had a knack for survival skills as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to his teaching role at the Temple, Honoran would pilot Master-Padawan teams to the planet of Ragoon VI to put their survival skills to the test. Like fellow Master Winso Bykart, Honoran would land his ship several kilometers from the drop site and disappear into the wilderness, and challenge the teams to track him. On one occasion, Honoran brought Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker to the world and engaged in his usual challenge. Kenobi hoped the test would help Skywalker bond with him, since they were having some difficulty connecting. However, the trip took a dangerous turn as Honoran was rendered unconscious by the mysterious Granta Omega, who used him as bait for Kenobi. While Omega escaped from the Jedi when his plan was foiled, Honoran was rescued by his comrades and returned to Coruscant to recuperate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
