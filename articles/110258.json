Rebel technicians also upgraded some R5 units for starfighter use, bringing their astrogation capabilities up to the level of the R2-series, though the personality flaws persisted. Wedge Antilles used an R5 model with the designation of R5-D2, nicknamed \"Mynock.\" The droid was upgraded and redesignated R5-G8 after a memory wipe, and Antilles changed its nickname to \"Gate.\" When first assigned the droid, Antilles judged its slightly larger target profile to actually be an advantage, as it might block a laser that would otherwise reach the cockpit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aboard Imperial warships, R5 units were used to monitor medical equipment such as life support capsules."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to their design problems, a number of R5 units were part of the population of ownerless, unwanted, and otherwise abandoned droids inhabiting Kligson's Moon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
