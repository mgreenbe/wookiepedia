His family sold him to Jabba as a slave. Vedain was a gambler, and played sabacc with the other Nikto in Jabba's court. He piloted the sail skiff carrying Jabba's prisoners to be executed at the Great Pit of Carkoon in 4 ABY, and like other skiff guards had no idea of how the tide of the battle would change hands. After Luke Skywalker, one of the prisoners, obtained his lightsaber, Lando Calrissian, who was disguised as a skiff guard himself, attacked Vedain. The two struggled until knocked overboard by a shot from one of the cannons on board Khetanna, Jabba's Ubrikkian Industries Luxury sail barge. Lando managed to grab onto the skiff as they fell keeping somewhat safely away from the sarlacc's mouth while Vedain fell to the ground sliding right towards it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vedain was played uncredited by stuntman Paul Weston[source?] in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, the final installment of the Star Wars original trilogy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
