They had long, thin legs that, when at rest, splayed out to either side and folded at the knees so as to bring the belly close to the ground. Their feet were narrow and long, with three pointed toes. Their arms, also thin, were short in comparison to the rest of the body and terminated in hands with three fingers each. A long, wispy tail grew from the Mudgub posterior and ended in a barbed point."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mudgub head was large in relation to the body and was wider than it was tall. A bulbous snout was the dominant feature; this was divided by a wide mouth with plastic lips that could show emotion. Whether naturally or via make-up, some Mudgubs had large, red lips. Above the snout sat two bulbous white eyes with long eyelashes. Toward the back of the head were two projections that resembled ears with dark-colored fuzz fringing them. Some Mudgubs wore jewelry, such as earrings and necklaces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mudgubs lived in tribes, and at least one member of the species was recognized as a princess; her status was indicated by a gold-colored crown.
