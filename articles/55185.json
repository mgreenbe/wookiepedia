Bestowed upon an elderly soldier often seen as past their fighting prime, but still in possession of valuable experience, a gogi served as a trainer and overseer of Mandalorian special forces. It was within the gogi's authority to determine when and where a warrior under their tutelage traveled, and could recall their warriors if they were needed by the Mandalorian army. Mandalorians who trained under a gogi often remember their mentor and the experience fondly, and many subsequently looked forward to becoming a gogi themselves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the civil war between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, the veteran Mandalorian mercenary Teroch was a gogi living on the Outer Rim world of Vlemoth Port, where he resided in the enclave of Arumorut."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The title of gogi was first introduced to the Star Wars universe in The Unknown Regions sourcebook, written by Sterling Hershey, Rodney Thompson, and Daniel Wallace, and published April 20, 2010.
