As the droid was modeled after canine species, it featured a grasping jaw located in its head. It was designed to be able to hold an object without crushing it, and the droid was able to use the jaw to move incapacitated scouts out of danger. The presence of the grasper jaw, coupled with the droid's extensive sensor capabilities, limited the F1 to produce verbal communication in a narrow range of warning sounds. The E3 Companion Droid was also fitted with a grasper jaw."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
