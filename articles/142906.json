However, rather than fight against one another, they had forged an uneasy truce with each other. This led to the creation of \"The Council\"; a body replacing the Jedi Council and consisted of ruling body of six Jedi and six Sith. In this era, the last descendant of Luke Skywalker served as a Jedi sheriff and kept the peace in their jurisdiction only to be framed for the death of another Jedi. This led to the Council dispatching both Jedi and Sith to eliminate this foe causing the last Skywalker to go on the run. Unknown to anyone, however, the conspiracy was masterminded by a Jedi Master who's last name was Solo. The members of the Council differed from Jedi and Sith of previous generations as they harnessed the power of The Force in new and inventive manners which included shapeshifting while wearing sophisticated armor and infusing items with the power of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the future setting, the Jedi Outlaw concept was abandoned as it was deemed that it would not appeal to the average Star Wars fan but led to the basic concepts of The Force Unleashed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
