Nune starred as the shows protagonist, following a group of colonists kidnapped by Hutts on the planet Parcovey Minor to the planet Affavan where the ranger fought in gladiatorial combat to win their freedom. The colonists and Nune then took vengeance on the Kajidic that responsible for the kidnapping, with Nune at one point fighting the Hutt Huska in single combat. While Huska and Nune were not real, the shows story was based on the actions of the Belasco Free Volunteers after the real assault on Parcovey Minor, a slave raid backed by the Utoradii kajidic of Hutts. The character was mentioned by Thunys Albegron, Academician of Popular Studies, when Albegron spoke concerning the episode at the 6 ABY Conference on Popular Entertainment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Novan Nune was first mentioned in the 2014 fifth entry in the Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare Author's Cut series of posts by Jason Fry on the StarWars.com blog.
