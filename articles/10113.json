After the Wookiees destroyed a Trade Federation outpost, the leader of the colonists, Chewbacca, was present at a camp near a settlement run by his ally, Shoran. At the instructions of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, who was appointed by the Jedi Order as an advisor to the Wookiees, Chewbacca had his workers build a Jedi temple within his camp. Upon its construction Jinn's Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, arrived on Alaris Prime to collect a Jedi holocron found in Shoran's camp."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Immediately after Kenobi entered Shoran's camp, the Wookiee discovered a group of Trade Federation Droid Army battle droids that was remotely commanded by the droid LUH-989 heading for Chewbacca's camp. Upon learning of that fact, Jinn suggested that they sound a warning alarm to send the workers at the camp to safety, while between five and six Wookiees, including Chewbacca and at least two bowcaster troopers and a dragon trooper, waited at the edge of the camp to engage the droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The attack"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "LUH-989's three flamethrower-wielding beetle droids arrived at the camp and were destroyed by the Wookiees' bowcasters and flamethrowers. Six Battle Droid Beta Versions then marched in with E-5 blaster rifles and met the same fate. Shoran's camp was also affected by the attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shoran requested assistance in recovering from the attack in the form of one hundred nova crystals, which Jinn agreed to provide as thanks for alerting Chewbacca to the attack. Shoran reciprocated by offering one hundred units of ore in return. Kenobi also returned from Shoran's camp carrying the holocron, which he stored in the Jedi temple where it could generate more nova crystals for the Wookiees. Jinn recommended that the Wookiees train more troops for any future attacks. Afterward, scouts from Shoran's camp found a listening array also commanded by LUH-989, and forces from Chewbacca and Shoran's camps combined to destroy it. The Trade Federation forces were later expelled from the moon in the Battle for Alaris Prime."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack on Chewbacca's camp was first mentioned in the strategy guide for the 2001 LucasArts video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, before appearing in the game itself in the sixth level of the Wookiee tutorial campaign, entitled \"Allies and Jedi.\" The attack is a scripted event triggered when Obi-Wan Kenobi passes through the gates of Shoran's camp to collect the holocron. At the beginning of the level, the player has four combat ready units: Chewbacca, two bowcaster troopers, and one dragon trooper. Other units available for the player to create include grenade troopers, speeder bike scouts, and Jedi Padawans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Jinn recommends the player garrison their worker units in the base's command center for their safety in the game, the strategy guide indicates that such an action is unnecessary due to the small size of the invading force. The guide states that only five or six Wookiees are necessary for victory and that the level is difficult to lose, although the player will fail if Chewbacca is killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
