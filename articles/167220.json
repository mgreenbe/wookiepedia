Under the leadership of Sergeant Herron, Yung's squad tried to recover several newly-developed shuttles from the Rendili Vehicle Corporation's facility when Imperial forces seized control of the factory, but the mission was a failure because of bad intelligence on the size of the enemy forces. Herron sought aid from other Republic and Jedi forces, who were able to infiltrate the factory and open an access tunnel so the unit could enter the facility and steal the shuttles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
