Derrown was ruthless and considered to be one of the best bounty hunters in the galaxy. As the Parwan's biology produced intense electrical fields, it earned him the title of the Exterminator. His Parwan physiology allowed him to reach various heights and vantage points not easily accessible to those of standard density, although he lacked the speed and control that came with such mass. During the second year of the war, Derrown was brought to Serenno, along with other bounty hunters including Cad Bane, Obi-Wan Kenobi disguised as Rako Hardeen, and Embo. He, along with the other ten bounty hunters, would be put in the Box to see who would take part in a plot to kidnap Supreme Chancellor Palpatine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the first challenge of the Box, Derrown, as well as the other bounty hunters, survived the poisonous gas, Dioxis, thanks to the disguised Obi-Wan's quick plan to escape. In the second challenge, a room filled with spinning lasers, Derrown was able to once again escape quickly by using his Parwan abilities float to the hole in the roof, where he made his way out, following Cad Bane and Obi-Wan Kenobi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the third challenge, Derrown played a vital role to the survival of the other hunters. In this challenge, ray-shielded walls began to close in on the hunters, while a switch to deactivate it lay behind another ray shield. Derrown was able to inject himself with an electrified serum, provided by Moralo Eval\u2014which would have been deadly to all the other hunters\u2014to allow his electrified Parawan body to pass through the ray shield. Derrown did so with ease, and shut off the ray shields, allowing the surviving bounty hunters to pass into the final challenge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the disguised Obi-Wan Kenobi completed the fourth and final challenge, Derrown and the remaining hunters, including Kenobi, Twazzi, Embo, and Bane formed the group with the task to kidnap Supreme Chancellor Palpatine on Naboo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Immediately upon arriving on Naboo, the hunters infiltrated a hangar; Derrown killed two mechanics, strangling one with his tentacles and snapping the neck of another. After securing the hangar, all the bounty hunters were given their instructions by Bane. Derrown was assigned to be disguised as a Senate Commando; he would breach the ray shield that would be surrounding the chancellor and destroy the main generator, allowing the rest of the hunters to make off with the chancellor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the trail leading to the stage, Derrown was confronted by another Senate Commando. However, he managed to pass through. With nothing to stop him, Derrown sneaked beside the shield generator, deactivated it, and put it on self-destruct. The blast knocked Chancellor Palpatine unconscious and blew his cover. Anakin Skywalker rushed to attack Derrown and the Parwan used his blasters to fire at Skywalker, only to have them sliced in two by the Jedi's lightsaber. Derrown was then able to subdue Skywalker with ease by electrically shocking him with his tentacles. Derrown then attempted to escape using his jetpack, but Obi-Wan Kenobi, still in disguise as Rako Hardeen, used a sniper rifle to disable the jetpack, sending Derrown spinning out of control and into the ground."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Derrown was seen at Plop Dribble's on Stobar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character of Derrown was voiced by Matthew Wood. Derrown's design was based on a piece of artwork done by Ron Cobb of a colorful and odd Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina alien from the 1977 original Star Wars film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope that ultimately went unused. Unlike Derrown, who is more like a sentient gasbag, the Cobb's artwork described the alien as a ambulatory and tropical plant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
