He was shot in the head in his own house and a DL-44 blaster was put into his hand to make it look like he had taken his own life. The Chirq Council wanted to kill Mayor Draav and tried to make it look like Sheridian was the culprit. They left a scrap paper with his letterhead near a transmitter that had been used to relay threatening messages to Draav. An independent agent investigating the case for Lieutenant Cope found the paper and then discovered Sheridan's body with the blaster in his hand. Sheridan was thought to be the one responsible for the attempted murder and the case was closed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However Draav was later killed in a second assassination attempt and the case was reopened.
