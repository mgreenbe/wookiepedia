Saun Dann, a Human merchant on Kashyyyk, sold such groomers to his Wookiee customers and he offered a newer model of groomer to an off-duty Imperial guard during the Blockade of Kashyyyk. Dann touted the functionality of the newer groomer model and informed the Imperial guard that the device could be plugged into any standard laser outlet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
