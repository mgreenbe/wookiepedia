The key to the project was the planet Taris, where the residual remains of millions of life-forms incinerated during the Destruction of Taris in 3956 BBY were exposed to radiation from a reactor core, creating an extremely powerful energy source that would increase the potency of Republic weapons tenfold. Unfortunately for the Republic, Sith Lord Darth Baras decided to eliminate the War Trust and send his apprentice to Taris to hunt them all down. One by one, Republic generals were exposed and killed, while the technology and infrastructure necessary for Project: Siantide was destroyed, leaving the remaining Republic survivors at a dead end."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
