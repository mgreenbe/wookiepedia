The Delrakkin tribes pride themselves in being skilled warriors, hunters, and trackers. Most Delrakkin built their dwellings underground, although a group living above ground founded Delrakkin City. The planet was subjugated by the Galactic Empire, who forced all Delrakkins to live underground. The Empire planned to make the entire planet into a test site, and gave the Delrakkins poisoned bacta in an attempt to eliminate them. However, the Rebel Alliance intervened and drove the Empire elsewhere, saving the Delrakkins."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
