His right eye had been replaced with a yellow robotic eye and the rear of his head was almost entirely robotic. The many features could be hidden under Posla's armor with his helmet being able to split to reveal a large gun out the top of his head and a laser on the side. Posla also had a gun in his other knee and could semi-detach his hands to show two more guns with blades coming out of his knuckles. Furthermore, Posla had several more guns embedded in his torso and a twin gun attached to his right thigh.
