In the year 10 BBY, it transported 400 kilograms of the hyperfuel coaxium across the Iridium Mountains to the Crispin Imperial Depository, guarded by range troopers led by Captain Denwade Banevans. Han Solo and a group of thieves led by Tobias Beckett attempted to steal the valuable cargo on behalf of the criminal syndicate Crimson Dawn. The rangetroopers stationed to defend the train attacked them and shortly thereafter, Enfys Nest's Cloud-Riders also arrived on scene, planning to take the coaxium for themselves. In the course of the heist, Val detonated a bomb, destroying a bridge section of the conveyex track and sending ICC-5537 into the gorge below. Caught between the two opposing groups of thieves, the train's cargo was also destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 20-T Railcrawler conveyex transport designated as ICC-5537, simply referred to as \"Imperial train\" in the film's script, was designed by the Lucasfilm Ltd. design supervisor James Clyne."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
