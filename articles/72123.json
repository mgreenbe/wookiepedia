The district also included Jrade Plaza, the headquarters of the Spotts TradeChip Company, and the Chancellery Walkway, along which was the Finis Valorum Memorial. The sub-adult school PSAS-5128 was located in the north of the District. A gala fundraiser occurred here on 22 BBY which also featured an intricately-crafted Kime Enanrum-original ice statue, although the gala ended up ruined when Representative Jar Jar Binks destroyed the statue by accident due to placing the tablecloth the statue was on into his cummerbund, as well as trying to catch tumbling canap\u00e9s he knocked off of a passing waiter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
