When the Yavin base was destroyed, Monnon utilized this knowledge about the galaxy to find a suitable planet to build another base. He soon realized that Hoth was perfect due to the fact that the Empire would never search for them there. He believed that the rebels should use the environment to their own needs. When the first reconnaissance team mapped the planet, they found a set of natural caves that was the perfect location for the new base."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Constructing Echo base"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebellion moved the fleet to the planet and started the construction. The first job of the Corps of Engineers, led by Monnon, was expand the caves. Power conduits and communications tubes ran along the walls.

After the building was done, the Echo Base was opened."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Life in Hoth"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Living in such hard conditions was tough, but Kem and the rest of the troopers did their best for making the base habitable. It was made of solid ice and they needed to keep the structures at freezing temperatures. Because of this, many rebels decided that living in their heated transports vessels was much more comfortable than the living quarters. As the time passed, the inhabitants found new ways of amusement, like using the frozen lakes in the meteor craters as ice-skating rings and the \"tauntaun rodeo\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kem Monnon liked everything well-planed and clear. He didn't liked surprises, than he watched every stage of the base construction to make sure that anything would go wrong. He paid much attention to the discipline and security of his subordinates, punishing any lack of attention in this quest. Monnon's ability to motivate his crews were vital to the base construction. He admired General Rieekan and his defensive posture, and didn't tolerate anyone complaining about it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He was also the \"in-universe\" author of the Hoth chapter of The Illustrated Star Wars Universe.
