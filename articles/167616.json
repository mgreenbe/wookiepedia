Rather than send a letter to this woman, Zahara instead wrote to Teef, knowing that he would understand the context the letter was in. The letter was recovered aboard Purge after its occupants were decimated by a plague so it is unlikely that it reached him before it was released to the public for academic purposes in relation to the history of Purge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
