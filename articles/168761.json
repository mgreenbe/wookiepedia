The campaign was intense but ultimately successful, and Maarisa Zsinj was killed by her own son. The younger Zsinj was officially named the first Warlord of the Empire, and the elder Zsinj was expunged from Imperial history.

Soon after this, Zsinj became High Admiral of the Crimson Command, a fleet of Victory-class Star Destroyers, and gained the position of Grand Moff over the Quelii Oversector, a large portion of the northern quadrant of the galaxy.

However, he set up a base on Serenno, locked down his Oversector, and began to absorb the forces and territories of his rivals like Terrinald Screed and Nigel Nivers.

In 7 ABY, Iron Fist, Zsinj's personal command ship, narrowly escaped destruction at the hands of Solo's fleet twice, the first time due to New Republic collaboration with Imperial Admiral Teren Rogriss while the second engagement was precipitated by a double agent aboard the Iron Fist, Gara Petothel. Zsinj faked the destruction of the Iron Fist and escaped to his hidden base over Dathomir to plan his next move. However, his outpost was attacked by the Hapan war fleet. During the battle, Solo, who had won Dathomir in a gambling match and had journeyed to the world, flew his personal craft, the Millennium Falcon, on a strafing run against the Iron Fist.

During his early career, he developed a tactic of retreating inside an asteroid field when faced with a superior starfighter force, waiting for the pursuers to move in using the asteroids as cover, and then blowing up the asteroids to smaller pieces with turbolaser blasts, with the resulting debris clouds being extremely effective in destroying, damaging and/or forcing the attackers to abort their attack.

Dathomir was a backwater world, where the Imperial garrison was still equipped with broken-down A5 Juggernauts and even basic supply shipments were irregular, but the Empire built a prison complex on the planet for political dissidents and intellectuals. Emperor Palpatine eventually realized that the Force-sensitive Dathomiri Nightsisters were too much of a threat to be allowed off-planet. To eliminate this threat, Zsinj attacked the prison from orbit, destroying every spaceworthy craft. Although this stranded all the Imperial personnel on the planet along with the Nightsisters, Palpatine applauded Zsinj's actions, promoted Zsinj to admiral, and gave him command of the newest Executor-class Star Dreadnought, Brawl.

In this lofty new position, one of Zsinj's duties was to conquer the Drackmarians and control the Rimward stretch of the Hydian Way super-hyperroute. To that end, the Quelii Sector Fleet was the single largest in the Imperial Navy. Even as he gained power and prestige, Zsinj maintained a public persona that belied his genius.

Zsinj broke away from the Empire with the forces under his command, renaming the Star Dreadnought Brawl to Iron Fist in honor of his first command and making it the centerpiece of his military forces, setting up headquarters on the planet Serenno, and ruthlessly dealing with any Rebel threat within his holdings. However, Zsinj's breakout from central authority was not entirely evident, and the Ruling Council's advisers could find no fault with his tactics at first because he loudly proclaimed loyalty to the true Empire, having learned a hard lesson from the downfall of his mother. Instead of trying to seize more power and territory by force, Zsinj worked to solidify his power base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zsinj sent emissaries to the Alliance of Free Planets and later the fledgling New Republic, causing them to initially leave him alone as they focused on nibbling at the Imperial forces based on Coruscant, though Mon Calamari forces did harass his borders somewhat in 4 ABY before shifting to a more defensive posture. During this time, a growing rivalry began to develop between Zsinj and warlord Treuten Teradoc, whose own pocket Empire, the Greater Maldrood, bordered Zsinj's territory to the south. Throughout the following years, the two engaged in a series of border skirmishes\u2014of all his fellow warlords, Teradoc was the one for whom Zsinj had the greatest antipathy.

With most true stormtroopers remaining loyal to the Imperial Ruling Council, some warlords chose to equip regular infantry with stormtrooper armor. Zsinj took a different route, choosing instead to form his own elite military force. Assembled and led by General Melvar, the Raptors combined aspects of the stormtroopers and the Emperor's Royal Guard, and they were loyal only to Zsinj. Zsinj's industrial complex created or purchased unique equipment for the Raptors, like Incom Y-4 \"Raptor\" transports and TIE Raptors. Known for both covert and public actions, the Raptors defended Zsinj's holdings, protected his allies, and terrified his enemies. Zsinj made overtures, both friendly and aggressive, to planets spread throughout the galaxy.

Through his subordinates Zsinj operated like a rebel force unto himself. Outside of his official borders, his cells controlled territories of varying size, from entire planets down to individual companies. Using a variety of aliases like \"Cortle Steeze\" and \"Lord Houghten Ween,\" Zsinj built up a support network independent from his military force. Having consolidated his forces, Zsinj took over the Tion Hegemony, extended his protection to the Corporate Sector, and annexed some territory along the Hydian Way abandoned by Ardus Kaine, extending his Empire as far as to Bogden in the Inner Rim."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During this time, Zsinj built his Dathomir shipyards, started mining operations on Dathomir's fourth moon, and initiated some of his many special projects. One of the first of his plots to bear fruit was Project Chubar. Zsinj took control of Binring Biomedical Product, a company based on the Corporate Sector world of Saffalore. There, ex-Imperial scientist Tuzin Gast and his subordinates used genetic and chemical therapy to increase the intellect and Human-like qualities of non-human species such as Gamorreans, Ewoks, and Talz. Zsinj personally captured samples for the project. Gast eventually chose to commit suicide in his laboratory with a small explosive device, and the most notable success of this project, an enhanced Gamorrean subject named Gamma-9104, was allowed to escape. Gamma-9104 later took the name Voort saBinring and went on to join the New Republic Defense Fleet.

This attack sidetracked the New Republic's plans to attack both Zsinj and Teradoc for some time. In 5 ABY, Zsinj repelled an attempt by Mon Calamari Republic Admiral Kalback to gain a foothold on the Hydian Way at Corsin. Kalback was overwhelmed by the Iron Fist and forced to retreat, and the New Republic had to shift their focus to eliminating the mysterious Lord Shadowspawn. In 6 ABY, another Mon Calamari Admiral, Ragab, attempted another push up the Hydian Way to cut off some of Coruscant's support from the Pentastar Alignment and the New Territories.

A modified Dwarf Star-class freighter bearing a name that followed New Republic conventions, Vengeance Derra IV, arrived in orbit of Borleias and used a secret backdoor in the New Republic's identification system to fake a correct ID. Only Rogue Squadron pilot Corran Horn's instinct allowed the New Republic forces to destroy the freighter's TIE fighters and TIE Bombers and drive the freighter out of the system.

The real Rogue Squadron destroyed the Termagant, but not before Zsinj prepared a HoloNet broadcast to Coruscant claiming that he had destroyed the convoy and Rogue Squadron for Humanitarian reasons. Zsinj claimed that the bacta was deliberately tainted by New Republic agents to get rid of the aliens on Coruscant, and implored the population to support him. This HoloNet broadcast was aired worldwide, however his broadcast had the misfortune of being sent nearly twelve hours after an official report showing the survival of Rogue Squadron.

Following his success in liberating Thyferra, Rogue Leader Wedge Antilles and his unit was assigned to this force.

Admiral Trigit ordered Gara Petothel to plant false intelligence in New Republic databanks that allowed a small force under his command to destroy Talon Squadron in the Gravan system. Then, unlike Isard, he retrieved his agent rather than killing her. This action, and the attitude behind it, was met with Zsinj's approval. Zsinj and Trigit also implemented Project Morrt, which allowed Trigit to locate and nearly destroy the New Republic forces on Folor. Only a creative decoy tactic by the Wraiths, who taunted Zsinj's subordinate by labeling themselves with the comical names of \"Dinner Squadron\" and \"Silly Squadron,\" allowed the New Republic to escape the base. An empion mine, placed in the Xobome system as part of this project, could have destroyed Wraith Squadron. Unfortunately for Zsinj, they were able to use another creative tactic to foil Trigit.

Zsinj's interest was piqued by analysis of the Hawk-bats' combat communications, which had been filtered by communication system modifications performed on their TIE interceptors by Castin Donn. The intercepted signals led Zsinj to believe that an Ewok was flying with the Hawk-bats. During dinner with Zsinj, \"General Kargin\" of the Hawk-bats\u2014in reality, Garik Loran\u2014spun a tale about his \"most ferocious pilot\", Kettch.

Being an expert in body language, Passik believed that Donn had already been killed and that Zsinj's people had installed a pump in Donn's chest to simulate breathing as a test for the Hawk-bats, so she acted before any of her fellow pilots could do anything rash. After Donn's death, the Hawk-bats departed the Iron Fist without incident, and Zsinj was left with little doubt about their veracity.

The information from Zsinj showed that the facility was defended by a large New Republic force, and implied that the facility orbited Coruscant, though the Wraiths were uncertain what could be in orbit over Coruscant that would merit the risk of a raid. However, the information about New Republic forces was a ruse on Zsinj's part to guard against betrayal by his pirate allies.

He found the weaknesses in the construction facility's security by helping a colonel in the ship's complement to set up a smuggling operation.

Nelprin destroyed the bridge deflector shields of the Razor's Kiss, and the New Republic fleet pounded the undermanned and poorly-defended ship. Zsinj moved to protect his prize, and launched swarms of TIEs. The Razor's Kiss lost its bridge during the fight, and Trooper Gatterweld, an Imperial loyalist, decided it would be better for Zsinj to own the ship than to let it be destroyed and attempted to save the ship using the auxiliary bridge.
