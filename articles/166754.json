They were created by the DarkStryder and contained large brains which were flash-printed with necessary skills. The species was created to be extremely loyal to their creator. Despite their complex brains, they were unable to learn new skills that were not flash-printed. It was believed that the Yimi were crafted by DarkStryder to be twisted versions of the ancient Kathol themselves, as a cruel joke on its own creators."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
