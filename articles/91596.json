Consequently, Count Dooku deceived a Jawa clan into believing that their fellow Jawas were being made slaves by the Galactic Republic. This treachery allowed him to buy Republic ship parts from the Jawas, which were used to retrofit warships of the Confederate Navy. In exchange, the Sith Lord promised them that, given time, the Republic would be driven from the Outer Rim and their people would be freed from Republic oppression. As a result of this trade, the Separatists won several battles in the Outer Rim and Republic losses increased dramatically in this region of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Concerned by the fact that the Separatists appeared to be using Republic weapons against their own ships, Republic Intelligence followed a trail of evidence leading to Tatooine. Suspecting a Jawa clan to be responsible for recovering the debris and selling them to Dooku, Grand Master Yoda went on a mission to Tatooine in order to investigate. There, disguised as the Jawa trader Nemb of Adoy Clan, Yoda infiltrated the suspected clan. That night, he found the Separatist slave camp, which was guarded by at least one B1-Series battle droid, and freed its prisoners, including Fodani. The next day, during a visit of Count Dooku on Tatooine, Fodani revealed to his clan that it was actually the Separatist leader who had enslaved the Jawas. Yoda then engaged Dooku in a lightsaber duel, while the Jawas helped him by firing their ion blasters at the Sith Lord. Seeing that his scheme had failed, Dooku fled the planet aboard his his Punworcca 116-class interstellar sloop."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the event, the Jawas put an end to their trade with the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
