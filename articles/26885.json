He met his end at the hands of Darth Vader during Operation: Knightfall, when the Order 66 go-ahead was given."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early years and rise"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Human male Cin Drallig was born on Lavisar. Like most Jedi of the era, it can be surmised that Drallig was brought to the Jedi Temple soon after being discovered to be Force-sensitive and sorted into an Initiate clan for group instruction in the Jedi academy. Here, he would have trained until he graduated the academy and was selected by a Jedi Master as a Padawan. Eventually, Drallig passed the Jedi Trials and was made a Jedi Knight by the High Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later on in his career, Drallig began his servitude as a lightsaber instructor, in keeping with the Jedi custom of passing on their special knowledge to the next generation\u2014especially seeing as Drallig possessed true talent as a swordsman. Over his career, Drallig taught the basics of Forms I through VI to thousands of students, including such stars-to-be as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. In 31 BBY, one of Master Drallig's classes on the seven forms of lightsaber combat was recorded on the Great Holocron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, Drallig was introduced to the contentious and troublesome Padawan Serra Keto. Serra's defiant ways had nearly gotten her expelled from the Order on more than one occasion, and her Jedi Masters were exasperated. Envisioning the great Jedi she had the potential to become, Master Drallig took young Serra as his Padawan and helped her find her center. Under Drallig's guidance, Serra's understanding of the Force and her lightsaber skills blossomed, inspiring a strong bond of devotion between student and Master. Though it never entirely disappeared, Keto's rebelliousness eventually subsided, and she went on to become Master Drallig's most accomplished apprentice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After many years of service and attaining the rank of Jedi Master (no earlier than 31 BBY), Drallig was elected Battlemaster (or swordmaster), making him the leading lightsaber combat instructor in the Temple. Though it smacked of disrespect, Drallig earned the unflattering nickname of \"the Troll\" among the Order."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the galaxy-spanning Clone Wars, Drallig was tasked with protecting the Jedi Temple. As head of security there, he spent most of his time in the Temple, patrolling its corridors and pathways. His position also put him in charge of the Jedi Temple Guard and their assignments. As the Clone Wars continued to unfold, Drallig grew particularly concerned with the growing hostility towards the Jedi from Republic citizens."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stationed on Coruscant, Drallig made his home deep within the Jedi Temple. Despite his diligent watch on security, however, intrusions into the Temple did happen, such as when bounty hunter Cad Bane stole a Jedi holocron from a restricted vault and got away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 20 BBY, two years into the war, the Jedi Temple hangar was the site of a shocking terrorist bombing that cost numerous lives, prompting Cin Drallig to keep an especially close watch on the Temple's perimeter. A throng of protestors\u2014family and friends of workers killed in the explosion\u2014gathered at the steps of the Temple to criticize the Jedi's involvement in the war. Flanked by two members of the Jedi Temple Guard, Drallig stood before the masses when Anakin Skywalker showed a hologram of a suspect, Jackar Bowmani, to the Jedi Master, which was seen by Bowmani's wife Letta Turmond. Master Drallig admired young Skywalker's assertiveness in solving the alarming case, but was most concerned at how vulnerable the Order had become, and how the image of the Jedi as benevolent protectors had become much too fragile."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to his responsibilities as head of security, Drallig still found the time to teach lightsaber combat, as indeed the ongoing war placed emphasis on Padawans' combat training in favor of other abilities. After the death of fellow Jedi Mierme Unill, Unill's Padawan, Zett Jukassa was informally assigned to Master Drallig, awaiting reassignment. Under Drallig's tutelage, Jukassa became capable as a swordsman by the age of 10, in 19 BBY."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Order 66"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 BBY, when the Order 66 go-ahead was given and Anakin Skywalker\u2014now the newly christened Darth Vader\u2014led the 501st Legion in a raid against the Jedi Temple, Drallig's skills marked him as a priority target for elimination by the Sith Lord himself. Though Jedi Masters Shaak Ti and Jurokk directed the Temple's defense the night of Order 66, Drallig nonetheless played a major part that fateful night. He was in the process of giving lightsaber lessons to teenage Padawans Bene and Whie Malreaux when the Sith Lord began his murderous rampage. Deep within the Jedi Temple he prepared for Vader's coming, directing such Jedi as Olana Chion in the Temple's defense."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Engaging the clones alongside Serra Keto, Drallig's efforts proved initially successful, as he managed to penetrate the occupying forces' upper level defenses. As Vader was alerted to this, however, he went on a hunt for his former lightsaber instructor. Entering Drallig's territory, Vader discovered what carnage had been wrought there, with dead clones and the signs of battle being everywhere. Before Drallig could move against the Dark Lord, however, Serra Keto confronted Vader on her own, and was slain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Drallig rushed into the room, he witnessed Keto fall to the Sith Lord. Engaging Vader in the Temple training hall along with two of his students, Bene and Whie Malreaux, they were nonetheless unable to defeat the Dark Lord. Vader outclassed both Padawans, choking Bene with one hand while he dueled Drallig with the other."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Drallig himself ultimately proved unable to defeat a raging Sith Lord in combat. After the demise of the Padawans, the Battlemaster went into a short exchange of lightsaber strikes with Vader before he was hacked down from shoulder to torso. He could only look on in shock and fall to the ground, where he shortly died. The incident was recorded by Temple security camera TR4-121."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Drallig's body was later found by Grand Master Yoda and Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had returned to the Temple to reset the emergency beacon to warn all surviving Jedi to flee into exile. The discovery caused Kenobi great grief, having considered the Battlemaster a friend. Kenobi and Yoda also watched the security recording of the Battlemaster's fatal last duel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Order nearly extinct overnight, the newly emerged Galactic Empire needed to cover up the true reasons for the execution of the Republic's peacekeepers. On behest of Emperor Palpatine, Sate Pestage compiled official reasons for each Jedi's death. Incident report #890-I, filed by Commander CC-1119, contained Master Drallig's certificate of death, while Pestage reported to the public that the Battlemaster had been \"killed in combat against Imperial agents.\""}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cin Drallig's legacy was passed down by those Jedi who survived to train others, including Master Kenobi's training of Luke Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While still adjusting to his life-supporting armor, Darth Vader often reflected upon the actions that had brought him to such a state. One of his clearer memories was that of crossing blades with Master Drallig, his former lightsaber instructor, the night of Order 66."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Drallig's recorded knowledge of the seven forms, made in 31 BBY, was found in the Great Holocron by the New Jedi Order, along with another of his recordings on the marks of contact."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cin Drallig was an esteemed Jedi Master, possessing both great skill as a swordsman and a calmness of mind and spirit. Described as patient, focused, and directed, and representing the tenets of the Jedi Order in their purest form, he had given himself over completely to the will of the living Force. Despite his great reputation as a warrior, his humbleness of character was such that he dedicated his life to training countless Padawans in the art of the lightsaber, leading by example and instilling in his students a sense of the Order's values and beliefs. Where several other Masters had failed, Drallig was also the only one insightful enough to see the great potential of rebellious Padawan Serra Keto, and reach through to her to make that potential become reality."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In his recording on the Great Holocron, Drallig presented some personal views on the matter of lightsaber combat. In the wake of death caused by Aurra Sing and Darth Maul, and unlike some Jedi Masters, Cin Drallig refused to dismiss the study of Form II as impractical. He remained cautiously neutral regarding Form V, taking the side of neither proponent nor detractor, but emphasizing the need for such an offensive form to be used only with the proper intention of preserving peace. He also conceded that Form VI being the standard form of the Jedi Order did not mark it as the most worthy of study, but in general the most practical. As for cho mok, Master Drallig discouraged its use unless the student possessed enough knowledge of the opponent's physiology, so as to not accidentally kill. Master Drallig further stated that a Jedi should not hesitate to use any combat technique to kill a Sith Lord, not even sai tok. He stressed that the student's mindset must be that of defeating the danger the Sith pose, not to wish utter destruction upon them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cin Drallig's lightsaber instructor was none other than Master Yoda himself, and known for having outstanding talents as a duelist, Drallig became an incredibly skilled swordsman, gaining the rank of Battlemaster of the Order, due to his exceptional prowess in lightsaber combat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Clone Wars, Master Drallig was old but his age did not hamper his abilities, as he remained one of the Jedi's top swordsmen, his skills described as being \"nearly unparalleled.\" Drallig's skill was such that it was the conviction of Count Dooku that the renowned combatant General Grievous would be no match for the Battlemaster, should they ever face off against one another."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Drallig had developed his own unique style of lightsaber combat, calling upon the Force to enhance his speed and relying on unconventional and unpredictable movements."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Drallig had mastered all seven forms of lightsaber combat and his understanding and knowledge of each form was outstanding enough that he was considered the most prolific lightsaber instructor in the Temple, second only to Yoda himself. He was able to effectively train thousands of students in the use of the Forms I to VI, displaying consummate knowledge of the theory of each form, making thorough comments on each forms strengths and weaknesses. Drallig was also one of the few Jedi to achieve mastery over the Juyo variant of Form VII but in addition to fully understanding the style's weaknesses and strengths, he was also aware of how dangerous it was due to its aggressiveness and potentially exposing the user to the dark side, hence his caution towards who he would entrust it to. For example, Anakin Skywalker, as a Padawan, lamented the fact that Master Drallig wouldn't let him study Form VII."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Being the Temple's finest swordmaster at the time of Darth Vader's raid on the Jedi Temple, despite being heavily fatigued and elderly, Cin Drallig's swordsmanship proved to be great enough to kill off many of the Clones that attacked him and Darth Vader saw the need for he himself to personally fight him. In his ferociously intense duel, Drallig fought inspirationally well, nearly defeating Vader, and the younger and fully amped Sith Lord had far greater difficulty killing him than he did with the other Jedi he slayed during his purge of the Jedi Temple. By killing Master Drallig and his apprentice, Serra Keto, Vader had successfully removed one of the Temple's last hopes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although his nearly unprecedented mastery of lightsaber combat was his strongest trait, Cin Drallig also proved to be very powerful and accomplished in the use of the Force, displaying high levels of mastery over many Force powers when he fought Vader. He was considerably adept in the use of Force speed, capable of moving fast enough to be invisible to human's eye and often applied it to overwhelm his opponents. The Jedi Master was also proficient in the use of the protection bubble, which he used during his battle against Darth Vader, protecting himself while his Padawan fights him and at times manifesting a barrier to protect his student and was also capable of making this an offensive technique as well, encasing Vader within the bubble, and hurting him with its Force energy. His Barriers proved powerful enough that Vader, despite his extreme raw power in the Force, was not able to penetrate the shielding and had to wait until the barrier dispersed to continue. Drallig could heal with the Force, as shown by how he would restore his Padawan's stamina upon encasing him inside a Force Barrier and also applied it at times during his duel with Vader to heal himself. He also displayed incredible telekinetic mastery, as shown by how he was able to repel a Force Push from Vader and then blast him through a window with a single Force Push of his own as well as also levitating and hurling large chunks of earth upon Vader."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Drallig was also a highly competent leader, being the leader of the security guards of the Jedi Temple during the Clone Wars.

When Vader arrived in the greenhouse, he cut down Whie Malreaux and another teenage Padawan before quickly overwhelming Drallig and hacking through his shoulder. With Drallig and the older Padawans dead, the remaining children were quickly cut down by blaster fire. When Yoda and Obi-Wan later find Drallig's body, Yoda comments that Drallig would not abandon his young students."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the film, he is seen only briefly in a holographic recording, however, he has a larger role in the video game. In the PS2 Version, Cin Drallig managed to knock Vader down but Vader killed him soon after by impaling him via a lightsaber throw, while in the GBA Version, Vader triumphed over Drallig. The duel also takes place in the training room above and on the terrace outside the Room of a Thousand Fountains. According to Keeper of the Holocron Leland Chee, however, Drallig's death as it appears in the game is non-canon. Also, in the film, Drallig has dark blond hair, however, in the video game, he is shown with white hair. He is also wearing a different costume."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the video game adaptation, Cin appears as character in Duel Mode.

However, George Lucas would only allow either blue or green as the color of any regular Jedi's lightsaber blade. With the exception of Samuel L. Jackson's violet lightsaber blade he used as Mace Windu, Lucas would go no further with other colors.
