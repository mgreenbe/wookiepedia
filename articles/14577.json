Together with Clone Captain CT-7567\u2014nicknamed \"Rex\"\u2014and several other clone troopers, Tano attacked the Separatists' artillery position that was preventing the Republic from a direct assault on the planet's droid command base. Using his two blaster pistols, Rex destroyed several B1-Series battle droids that were operating one of the artillery guns, while Tano destroyed the gun itself and a DSD1 dwarf spider droid with her lightsaber. Tano then used the Force to throw one of the artillery shells at the remaining guns, and Rex placed a blaster shot on the shell, triggering an explosion that destroyed the entire artillery position. With her objective complete, Tano regrouped with Skywalker and Kenobi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The destruction of the artillery battery cleared the path for an attack on the Confederate command center. However, before any attack could be made, Skywalker and Kenobi were contacted by Clone Commander CC-2224, who informed them of an urgent message from the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. The Jedi and Rex returned to their forward command post and received the transmission inside one of the HAVw A6 Juggernauts. Jedi Masters Yoda and Ki-Adi-Mundi informed them that a Separatist agent had stolen a data file containing information vital to the Republic and was going to hand it over to the Confederacy on the planet Mon Gazza. To this end, Yoda and Mundi ordered Skywalker to go to Mon Gazza and retrieve the data file. Soon Skywalker, Tano, Rex, and Skywalker's astromech droid, R2-D2, set off for Mon Gazza, leaving Kenobi to continue the fight on Queel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle of Queel was featured in the December 2008 graphic novel The Clone Wars: Crash Course, written by Henry Gilroy and Gary Scheppke, and illustrated by the Fillbach Brothers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
