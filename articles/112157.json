He offered the team 8,000 credits to temporarily deactivate a Naboo sensor array located just outside of the city as part of the Federation's invasion plans. Daal told the students he simply wanted to evade taxes on a rare spice shipment in order to increase profits, and intended to land while the sensor was deactivated. In reality, Daal's unnamed backer was the Trade Federation, which wanted to move jamming satellites into Naboo space undetected in preparation for an invasion of the planet. Daal was later captured and detained by Royal Naboo Security Forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
