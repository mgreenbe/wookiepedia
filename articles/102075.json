By 19.48 BBY, thirty months into the conflict, the Republic, having finally committed enough of its industrial might toward the war effort, was winning the war. The Republic won a series of key battles at Duro, Commenor, and Balmorra, driving the Confederacy from its bases in the Core Worlds and the Colonies regions of the galaxy. The Confederate Navy retreated to the Mid Rim and the Outer Rim Territories, reinforcing its vast holdings on both sides of the Slice. Count Dooku also had other Confederate forces marshaled at Xagobah, Siskeen, Clak'dor VII, and Sluis Van. The Outer Rim Sieges began when, in response to the Separatist retreat, the Republic became fully committed to pummeling CIS bases at the borders of the Rim. Besides targeting Ryloth and Ossus, Jedi-led fleets from the Republic Navy assaulted Ord Radama and New Bornalex in an effort to reach Celanon and Count Dooku's homeworld of Serenno. Republic forces pursued the Separatists from Commenor to Kashyyyk, eventually sparking the Battle of Kashyyyk; and also from Duro to Bomis Koori IV, Tar Morden, and Sarrish, with further fighting break out at Triton and Llanic. Republic battle groups launched from Excarga and Rothana to clear the outer Corellian Run, attacking Siskeen and Tellanroaeg."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Besides the Battle of Kashyyyk, pivotal battles of the Outer Rim Sieges became the Battle of Boz Pity (19.43 BBY), the Siege of Saleucami, and the Battle of Felucia in 19 BBY. Jedi General Traavis led a series of campaigns against the Cassandran Worlds of Monhudle, New Bakstre, and Biitu, later moving his forces to assault Garqi. Jedi Master Plo Koon's victory at the Ywllandr system allowed Jedi General Ki-Adi-Mundi to invade Mygeeto. Another battlefront became Belderone, where General Grievous had planned to hide the Separatist Council, forcing him to move the Council to Utapau. Morale in the Core became high, as much of the Republic citizenry believed that the end of the war was near."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In reality, the purpose of the Outer Rim Sieges was to enmesh the majority of the Republic's forces at the fringes of its borders. Once committed, the Jedi and their detachments from the Grand Army of the Republic found themselves unable to break off, leaving Coruscant and the Core Worlds vulnerable. With the Republic's attention focused in the Outer Rim, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine\u2014with the Jedi Order about to discover his secret alter ego of the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious\u2014ordered General Grievous, as Sidious, to target the Republic capital world of Coruscant, six months into the Outer Rim Sieges."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Victory for the Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sieges\u2014and the war in general\u2014were brought to an abrupt end when Palpatine ordered the Republic's clone troopers to carry out Order 66, a contingency plan meant to exterminate all the Jedi should they ever betray the Republic. Spread thinly throughout the galaxy and isolated from each other, the Jedi were caught off guard when their clone soldiers turned on them, and most of them were killed immediately in the opening minutes of what became the Great Jedi Purge. On Mustafar, Darth Vader killed the Separatist Council and deactivated the droid armies, bringing the CIS to an end. Palpatine then declared himself Emperor of the galaxy, and reorganized the Republic into the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Battles of the Outer Rim Sieges"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mygeeto theater"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Serenno theater"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Felucia theater"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Siskeen theater"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Yag'Dhul theater"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Praesitlyn theater"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The earliest mention of this campaign comes from Han Solo and the Corporate Sector Sourcebook, where Alexsandr Badure is described as a veteran of the \"Outer Rim Wars\" portion of the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
