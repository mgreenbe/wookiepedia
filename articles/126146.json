Starkiller's training gear was both simple and versatile seeing as it survived numerous training sessions and volatile missions. Starkiller used numerous homemade variants of his basic gear and had repaired his original many times over his years as Vader's apprentice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One variant was his heavy training gear which was homemade. It gave basic protection in toxic and polluted environments. Another variant was Light training gear which weighed less then the basic training gear.
