The only Imperial presence on the planet is a small Imperial communications outpost, led by the lazy Sergeant Reybn and two other men. They prefer to relax and have fun, rather than doing actual work, reasoning that they're on one of the Empire's most distant outposts. Meanwhile, Vader encounters a pack of hyenax, vicious canine-like creatures that attempt to kill him. After slaying the pack leader, Vader is regarded as the new leader by the hounds. He helps them kill a large, horned mammal, then walks to the Imperial outpost, with the pack following him. The outpost crew is shocked over seeing Vader suddenly arrive, and are petrified as they watch him enter their Lambda-class shuttle. As Vader blasts off, the hounds kill the crew. Later, Vader arrives on Coruscant, and informs a commander that the communications outpost on Vaal will need a new crew. He then sends a small force to retrieve his ship, and tells them to treat it with their lives."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}]}
