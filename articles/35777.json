It was a fenced-off area on the planet Parnassos, where faded signs and the Gand Churkk warned visitors of the dangers of entering.

The lands were visible from Arratu Station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Brendol Hux's ship was shot down over the planet by Parnassos' automated defense system, the chrome-plated starship crashed in the dead lands, while Hux and three First Order stormtroopers ejected in a escape pod and landed closer to Claw territory.
