When Bo-Katan joined Death Watch, the Nite Owls sided with the group and with its leader, Pre Vizsla. After Maul killed Vizsla in battle and proclaimed himself the new leader of Death Watch, the Nite Owls, like the rest of Death Watch, split in two, with members siding with either Maul or Bo-Katan. Those who joined Bo-Katan became part of the Mandalore resistance and fought against Maul's Shadow Collective and his Mandalorian super commandos, even attempting to free Bo-Katan's sister, the former Duchess Satine Kryze of Mandalore, whom they had formerly opposed due to her pacifist idealism."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Nite Owls were a group of elite Mandalorian warriors who were a part of the extremist group Death Watch.
