A group of saboteurs were sabotaging the Empire's construction of the Death Star and after Darth Vader discovered that they had sent Galen Erso an ootheca in the hopes Erso would help them, he took a contingent of death troopers to the Korakanni Mound where they found the saboteurs, led by a rogue Geonosian queen who was breeding, despite the Geonosians being a servant species and forbidden from breeding freely.
