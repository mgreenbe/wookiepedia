In 32 BBY, he commenced multiple raids on Gardulla Besadii the Elder's outposts. For this, the Hutt placed a bounty on his head of 3,000 credits alive and 1,500 dead. Jango Fett, a bounty hunter, claimed this bounty. If he had been taken alive, the Tusken would have been fed to Gardulla's pet Krayt dragon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
