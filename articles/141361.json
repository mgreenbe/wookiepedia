Darth Jadus has shown his skills with this ability, as well as the entity Abeloth. Darth Phobos may have also possessed this ability. Some of Palpatine's Force Adepts who guarded his museum and vaults also possessed this power. Darth Plagueis briefly alluded to this ability as he talked of Sith who could move themselves instantaneously through time and space. The Dathomirian Nightsisters clan leader, Mother Talzin was proficient with this power. She appeared or disappeared in the form of green mist. Dread Master Tyrans was able to use this Force ability himself between falling floor tiles instantaneously, when fighting a raid from both the Republic and the Sith Empire in the Dread Palace. Dread Master Raptus also showed talent in this ability teleporting others to the far side of his chambers, away from himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vitiate was an avid practitioner of this ability, capable of teleporting anywhere in his immediate vicinity.

It also consumed a bit more energy than some powers and took a bit more time to master.
