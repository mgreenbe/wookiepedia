He was born into a life of slavery, but was rescued shortly after his fourth birthday by the exiled Jedi Master Vhiin Thorla. Master Thorla swept Dath away and offered him a place at The Enclave which Thorla had built for former slaves. Dath, with no where else to go, accepted with a gracious heart. While at The Enclave, Dath met other Twi'lek children whom Master Thorla had rescued from slavery, and he became very close friends with Tror and Meeva."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
