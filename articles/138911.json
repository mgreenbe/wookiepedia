This allowed many beings native to the sector to use this 'spirit energy' and thus have Force powers. However, this form of the Force was only usable within the Kathol sector under most circumstances, and when the Kathol were freed from servitude they made sure that the Ta-Ree energy would never be usable again, but some managed to keep the Ta-Ree energy. Some of Ta-ree's unusual powers were the Pyrospray and the Shadowstrike."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
