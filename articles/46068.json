It aired on July 6, 2015 on Disney XD. Following the events of the Battle of Endor, C-3PO and R2-D2 tell their friends the events of the prequel trilogy.

The two droids are planning to depart on a mission to liberate the lost battle droids of Mandalore with Admiral Ackbar, who owns a blue Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor called the Daisy Mae. Upon hearing 3PO's stories about his father 30 years ago, Luke Skywalker expresses his desire to hear the droid's history before the formation of the Galactic Empire, but 3PO sadly confesses that his memory was wiped. Only when R2 shows up with a junkdrive containing his memories prior to the rise of the Empire does 3PO tell his story."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "3PO begins with the day he was created by a young Anakin Skywalker, who flames at his mother for not serving his PB&J properly (\"I find your lack of white bread disturbing.\" he glares). Concurrently, Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala and her Jedi guardians Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi were escaping the Trade Federation's occupation of Naboo. Turbolaser fire from the Federation blockade damages the ship's hyperdrive, in the process sending Jar Jar Binks into the vacuum of space. After a brief repair on the hyperdrive, thanks to R2, her starship runs out of fuel and crash lands on Tatooine, where Qui-Gon, R2 and the queen (disguised as a handmaiden) visit a junk shop where they meet Anakin and 3PO. Because of Anakin's Force-sensitivity, Qui-Gon offers him a chance at freedom from slavery, while his owner, Watto, loudly sells red flags in the background (a comedic foreshadowing at the outcome of Qui-Gon's decision)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anakin enters the Boonta Eve Classic, where he wins the race, earning enough money to buy the hyperdrive and leaving Shmi and 3PO behind.

Ten years later, Obi-Wan and Anakin (now a \"headstrong Padawan\" as 3PO describes) are greeted by Padm\u00e9 and her four decoys before her ship is blown up by Jango Fett, who throws darts at Anakin, but misses.
