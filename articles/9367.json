Along with many of her fellow younglings, she received instruction from Jedi Master Yoda. During a session on lightsaber instruction, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi visited Ashla's class to talk with Yoda about the planet Kamino, a planet he was investigating that was missing from the Jedi Archives. One of Ashla's peers correctly guessed that someone had erased the files, explaining Kamino's absence. Kenobi later tracked Kamino down and found that a clone army had been created for the Galactic Republic, which the Jedi ultimately led during the ensuing Clone Wars. Ashla shared her name with another term for the light side of the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ashla appeared in the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones.
