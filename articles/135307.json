The original Geonosian spear was an effective means of herding beasts, but with the static pike, Gordarl Weaponsmiths added an electrically charged tip and elongated the weapon to twice the length of the spear. The spearhead can also pierce tough hides and thick furs. The charged tip could be set to deliver shocks to a creature's nervous system, or to kill them outright. An anodized shaft and insulated grip ensured the picadors themselves were not accidentally shocked by their own weapons. Additionally, the static pike was balanced, allowing the wielder to throw it like a spear."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The static pike was developed for use by Geonosian picadors to control creatures and prisoners in gladiatorial arenas such as the Petranaki arena of the Stalgasin hive. The Geonosians would often use the static pike while mounted on an orray and prod vicious animals so they would move towards the intended targets in the arena."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his scheduled execution in the Petranaki arena shortly before the First Battle of Geonosis, Obi-Wan Kenobi was able to break free of his chains, and liberated a static pike from its orray-mounted Geonosian wielder. He used this weapon to fend off a vicious acklay, and eventually threw it at the beast, striking it in the chest. However, to Obi-Wan's surprise, the creature used its jaws to rip out the pike that was protruding from its own chest and snapped it in half, thus forcing Obi-Wan to make a hasty retreat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
