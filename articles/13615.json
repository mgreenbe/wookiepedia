The Galactic Republic responded by sending clone troopers to recapture the world. However, they soon began to lose ground and the planet's cities became the sites for much bloody fighting. The Republic began an evacuation of the cities, while at the same time being forced to fall back. Jedi Master Yoda had been participating in the battle and he left to try and find reinforcements. While he was gone, the Separatist Commander Drogen Hosh, who was commanding their forces there, moved his troops in position for a final assault, and he sent an offer to a group of Jedi Padawans to let them surrender to him. However, soon after, Yoda arrived with reinforcements, turning the tide of the battle in the Republic's favor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
