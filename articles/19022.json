The bombing occurred at the same time as the pivotal Battle of Endor that would determine the outcome of the Galactic Civil War. The objective of Kuat was to prevent the victorious faction, either the Galactic Empire or the Rebel Alliance, to use this turning point to take control of the shipyards and the company. Kuat of Kuat detonated himself the bombs and died in the explosions. However, the indirect intervention of the bounty hunter Boba Fett stopped the chain reaction and prevented the full destruction of the shipyards. At the end, eighty percent of the shipyards remained intact. During the bombing, Rebel pilots of Scavenger Squadron, led by Commander Rozhdenst, managed to run to the docks and save several starships from destruction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
