As it turned out, Melarra was one of the five pilots Lorrick used to spread the Rakghoul plague to the worlds of the Hegemony, though the pilots were unaware of it at the time. As soon as Melarra's shuttle touched down on Kaon, rakghoul burst out of the cargo hold, starting the outbreak. Melarra herself managed to avoid getting infected and hid at the spaceport for several days while chaos ranged outside. When a group arrived to investigate the origin of the outbreak, Melarra came out of her hiding place and spilled everything she knew about Lorrick, asking to let her go freely in exchange."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
