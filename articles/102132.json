It was staffed by a mixture of Human agents and droids, including a 3PO-series protocol droid, an R2-series astromech droid, and a 4C observation droid. Outpost C-2 would analyze the data it received and prioritized the information before sending it on to Oracle Base. While the droids at Outpost C-1 did not forward information on a \"hunch,\" Outpost C-2 could react to information requiring an immediate response much faster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
