It was armed with two laser cannons mounted on the inside edges of its wings. The wings were fixed, lacking the variable geometry mechanics of later models, which rendered it incapable of walking, though it possessed repulsor jets for surface movement. It was intended mostly as a stop-gap design until the Vulture-class could enter service, and its known uses were on the planets Alaris Prime and Naboo. They were also utilized by the Confederacy of Independent Systems in a limited capacity, as evidenced by their deployment during the Battle of Aereen, but by the end of the Clone Wars the remaining fighters of this model had been mostly destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The actual designation of this model is unknown, as it is only called \"Droid Starfighter\" in the Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds video game.
