It belonged to Twi'leki scouts who set out to explore the moon of Uffel, as part of their vessel's droid pool. Its responsibility was as a maintenance droid which made minor repairs and kept the electronics system functioning properly. It had an extendible \"neck\" by which it could raise its head-cone to see into higher levels of the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the scouts' ship crashed in 90 BBY, R4-S2 was one of three droids which managed to survive and repair itself, along with fellow astromech R4-J9 and the administrative droid QS-2D. The droid went on to work for QS-2D, surveying mineral deposits of the moon and helping to set up mining operations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "R4-S2 was active in 31 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
