In addition, magcon fields were used on starships to help shield against the effects of ion storms and other forms of potentially damaging interstellar radiation. Fields of this type kept in air, but were notoriously poor at retaining heat, resulting in cold temperatures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Both Death Stars had quite large magnetic fields."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
