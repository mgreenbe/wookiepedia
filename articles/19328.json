Being in charge of the planet Chadawa, she split her government from the Empire by 5 ABY. Around that year Colonel Madrighast and his forces fled to Chadawa after taking many losses. Bordanivaux allowed the colonel's forces to take refuge at her planet. Months later, the 204th Imperial Fighter Wing, which served the Empire's loyalist forces, sought to destroy all civilization on Chadawa as punishment for the world going rogue. In the fighting that followed, the 204th was driven off after New Republic forces intervened and Madrighast and his Star Destroyer were lost, but the Chadawan government remained in place, although under the threat of invasion by the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bordanivaux was mentioned in the 2021 novel Victory's Price, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
