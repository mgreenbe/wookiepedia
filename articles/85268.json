It was a clean weapon that prevented the enemy from retaliating with modern weaponry. The bombs were the same size as a standard TIE Series starfighter, and any starship capable of carrying fighters could transport magnepulse bombs. It was a one-shot weapon, meaning it was mission expensive due to the sophisticated technology."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
