Those officers who were assigned to the underworld were notoriously hardened and burly cops, as opposed to the sleek police droids primarily assigned to the upper levels of Galactic City. Underworld Police officers wore heavy leather and metal armor with mechanical eye coverings, which gave them extra protection and anonymity, while denoting an authoritative presence. Around 20 BBY, underworld cops took part in the search for fugitive Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who was eventually captured. After the formation of the Galactic Empire, Underworld Police officers were used for patrol on the upper levels of Coruscant, not just the lower ones."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Coruscant Security Force assigned police officers to the underworld of the planet Coruscant in contrast to the polished police droids who were primarily charged with law enforcement in the upper levels of Galactic City. Coruscant cops were known to be burly and hardened officers, as they worked in the cutthroat environment of the planet's lower levels. They wore heavy leather and metal armor, with their heads completely covered, and mechanical eye coverings to protect them from the many dangers they encountered from the criminal elements of the underworld. The armor gave them a presence of anonymity and authority, and had the added effect of giving them a mystic reputation, as to others it was unclear if they were humanoid, droids, or something else. Coruscant cops were armed with a heavy blaster pistol, and they utilized the Republic police gunship and the Coruscant police speeder for patrol and pursuit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 20 BBY, the Coruscant Security Force received information from the Jedi Order that rogue Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano had escaped from a Republic military base after being accused of murder. She had been last seen fleeing to the lower levels, and so the Underworld Police were put on high alert. While checking IDs on a Coruscant train, several cops noticed the wanted Padawan and gave chase. Though they briefly overpowered her, Tano was able to push them off. She ran the car length and opened a door of the train before she dove onto the adjacent platform as the train passed. Three officers standing on the platform continued to give chase, ordering her to stop. When Tano continued to run, the cops opened fire on her, but she had already entered an turbolift by that time and escaped the officers' shots."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly thereafter, two police officers on Level 1315 spotted an explosion at a warehouse. They gave an alert to a search group composed of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, Jedi Master Plo Koon, and clone shock troopers with the Coruscant Guard, all of whom responded and were able to capture Tano at the warehouse."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the last years of the Republic, the aging Coruscant police droid models began to be phased out on the upper levels; however, they continued to see usage to supplement the Underworld Police officers. Additionally, with the formation of the Galactic Empire, Imperial stormtroopers were used increasingly for security patrols and police operations, at times interfering with the Coruscant Security Force's own operations. In 0 ABY, two Coruscant Security officers responded to a firefight at Landing Platform DDF453-17 between stormtroopers and smuggler Han Solo. The officers requested backup but were told to stand down as the incident was an Imperial matter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Coruscant Underworld Police first appeared in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series, in the episode \"To Catch a Jedi,\" which aired on February 24, 2013.
