Following the recovery, Droma remained in Solo's company for a short period of time, helping him to administer refugee camps on the planet Duro.

The creature began ripping away the station's exterior bulkheads and inhaling the passengers into its gaping mouth. Droma resisted the pull by grabbing hold of the knees of another passenger, who turned out to be Han Solo, a famous pilot and hero of the Rebellion, who had been aboard the station with his friend Roa. Droma suggested to Solo that the two of them close the corridor's blast shield, thus blocking the interior of the station from the pull. Solo agreed, but was caught in the creature's pull during the execution of the maneuver; the Ryn snagged Solo's body with his tail, holding him in place while the shield was closing. Knowing where the station's launching bays were, Droma then led Solo and a large group of frightened passengers there and summoned an R2 unit to open a locked hatch for them in the process by playing his flute-like beak.

Introductions were finally made, with Solo claiming to be named Roaky Laamu. The two shared a steak at a cafeteria, but, disliking the taste, headed to a restaurant. Solo was enraged to discover that the establishment did not serve Ryn and promptly ordered two meals to go. Eating with Droma in the observation bay, Solo asked many questions about the Ryn species, which he had never encountered before landing on the Jubilee Wheel. Droma later kibitzed a game of sabacc involving Solo, telling him that it was a fool's enterprise, and forced Solo to play against the randomizer, which Droma believed was the only worthy opponent. Solo won the game, took the equivalent of his buy-in stakes, and gave the rest to Droma. Droma passed most of it on to some deserving passengers on the lower decks but kept enough for himself to secure passage to Bilbringi, where he believed he could more easily secure a ride to Ralltiir. As Ralltiir was accepting refugees displaced by the invading Yuuzhan Vong, Droma thought it a good starting point for the search for his family. At the now-empty sabacc table, he used the game's cards to tell Solo's fortune."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After sharing Solo's cabin space overnight and annoying him with his swishing tail, Droma was again abandoned by the frustrated pilot, but caught up to him in a corridor as Solo was in mid-conversation with Major Showolter, an agent of New Republic Intelligence. Injured from an attack by Yuuzhan Vong warriors, Showolter bid Solo to hide two defectors from the Yuuzhan Vong, Elan and Vergere. Droma was surprised to hear Solo's real name, but would later claim it was a name he hadn't heard before. Solo, after sending Showolter to sick bay, attempted to prevent Droma from involving himself in the situation, but the Ryn reminded Solo that he knew the ship better, including good places to hide the defectors. After Solo reluctantly agreed, the Queen was interdicted from hyperspace, and announcements were made over the ship's loudspeakers that the bridge was under assault by raiders. The party of four made their way to the ship's docking bay, but on the way, Solo saw Reck Desh and temporarily left the other three in order to confront him. All four were captured by Desh's Peace Brigade companions, and Desh realized that Elan and Vergere were Yuuzhan Vong defectors. He took them into custody, and, hoping to get rid of Solo, forced his foe to step into a deactivated drop shaft. Solo survived the fall by grabbing hold of Droma's tail. The move caused Droma grievous pain, but Solo insisted that he wouldn't forget that the Ryn had just saved his life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chasing after Desh, the two arrived at the docking bay just as New Republic Elite Forces were boarding the Queen, which had arrived at Bilbringi.

Solo forestalled a warm welcome with his family in order to ask his wife where Desh's ship had departed to, and hurriedly introduced her to Droma as he raced up the ramp.

However, the Yuuzhan Vong had attacked Bilbringi, and in the midst of the space battle there, Droma and Solo found Desh's shuttle drifting dead in space. Droma took over the pilot's station as Solo boarded, and found the entire crew, including Desh, dead. The two defectors had survived, however; Solo brought them aboard the Falcon, and Droma recognized Vergere as belonging to the Fosh, a species he had seen before. The wary Ryn warned Solo that she could not have been of extra-galactic origin. Suddenly suspicious, Solo realized that the Yuuzhan Vong warship which had started firing on them was deliberately missing, and suspected a trap. As he left his ship's cockpit in order to confront the defectors, Droma took the controls again, but abandoned his post on a hunch and entered the rear hold. As the door to the hold opened, Solo emerged, gasping for breath, and swallowed some fresh air after having inhaled some of Elan's bo'tous poison. Droma was shocked to discover that Elan was actually a Yuuzhan Vong agent who had been assigned to poison and wipe out Luke Skywalker's Jedi Order, and was now dead, having committed suicide by swallowing her own poison. Droma then killed the insect-like creatures that the bo'tous spore produced and raced back to the cockpit while Solo searched the ship's corridors for Vergere. She fled in an escape pod, and Droma and Solo veered the Falcon away from the Yuuzhan Vong warship, which was then repulsed by the Quasar Fire-class bulk cruiser Thurse of the New Republic Defense Fleet.

As they prepared to depart the latter world for Sriluur, Droma confessed his hesitancy to travel near Hutt Space, as Hutts had historically enslaved the Ryn. On their way to Sriluur, Solo received intelligence from his wife that five of Droma's six clanmates had been evacuated from Gyndine, while his sister had been left behind."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Above Sriluur, the Falcon was attacked by a group of coralskippers. Droma attempted to plot a hyperspace jump to Nar Shaddaa, but Solo insisted on challenging the ships in the planet's atmosphere. Droma immediately agreed to the task and proved himself a very able co-pilot in the ensuing firefight, even destroying several of the enemy craft himself. After finishing off its attackers, the Falcon entered hyperspace, and Solo complimented the Ryn on his shooting. However, a power converter that had been damaged in the firefight left the ship without enough power to get to Nar Shaddaa. Droma suggested Kashyyyk as a location to obtain a new power converter, but Solo insisted on Tholatin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With a damaged hyperdrive, the Falcon made a long, slow trip to Tholatin. Upon arrival, Droma and Solo landed in Esau's Ridge, a rift in the planet often used by smugglers on the otherwise uninhabited world. With Droma posing as the ship's captain and Solo acting as Miek, his first mate, they presented passcodes obtained from Solo's smuggling days to Plaan, the Weequay security chief. Droma claimed that they had received the codes from the mechanic Shug Ninx on Nar Shaddaa. Plaan informed them of a contractor who was paying freelancers to transport refugees to planets that the Yuuzhan Vong planned to attack and that a group of refugees was due to be transported off Ruan very soon. Following the trail, Solo and Droma headed to Ruan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After passing through Ruan customs, Droma was eager to begin the search, but Solo wondered if his clanmates would have joined the mercenaries who intended to transport them offworld. Droma, in response, insisted that his clanmates were far too clever. With over 100 refugee camps to search, the two checked the central databank on a tip from a BFL-series droid named Baffle and then hitched a ride on the droid's landspeeder to the camp which the databank claimed housed five of Droma's clanmates. Upon their arrival at the camp, Droma was mistaken for another Ryn and was arrested on charges of forgery of official documents, a crime which his clanmates had actually committed. Solo was advised to get offworld, else he would be charged as an accessory after the fact. Droma was forced into labor at a product enhancement facility, but was soon rescued by Solo. After convincing Bow, a sentry at the facility, to take Droma in for a medical evaluation, Solo drew a blaster on Bow in the turbolift of the facility's east wing and told Droma to hide him in a closet. The Ryn deposited the sentry in a room full of deactivated droids and rendezvoused with Solo, who, unbeknownst to Droma, had reactivated hundreds of the facility's droids as a favor to Baffle. Bow thus escaped his captivity and chased the two out of the facility; Droma and Solo, in turn, commandeered Bow's landspeeder and escaped."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hoping to avoid the surface scans of the pursuing speeders, Solo dropped their landspeeder into an irrigation channel. Nevertheless, a gate in the channel was closed by Bow, which caused the pair's speeder to crash and deposit them in a muddy ditch. Manipulating weather control, Bow then caused a tidal wave to engulf them. After nearly drowning, Solo boarded the floating speeder and dragged Droma, who was a poor swimmer, aboard, just before the vehicle went tumbling over a waterfall. Solo and Droma were both forced by the water's current through white-water rapids before being caught in a fine-mesh net and picked up by a Scout Collector. Believing that they were about to be flash-frozen, the two were shocked to discover that they had in fact been rescued by Baffle and were directly beneath the spaceport where the Falcon was docked. Thanking Solo for his assistance in reactivating the droids, Baffle revealed that the refugee ship Trevee was headed for Fondor. Droma was surprised to learn that his clanmates were aboard and not still on Ruan.

Upon arrival in Fondorian space, they gave New Republic First Fleet Command and Control a legitimate transponder signal and identified themselves as the Falcon. Despite their honesty, a New Republic controller told them that the Trevee had dropped its cargo in an area off-limits to unregistered ships and would not let them proceed. Thinking quickly, Solo and Droma figured that the mercenaries who had made the drop would want to flee as far away as possible from the Yuuzhan Vong's next targets. The two decided on Tholatin as the most likely location. While preparing to make a hyperspace jump to Tholatin, they located the Trevee at the edge of Fondorian space and decided to attack it. As Fondorian Flight Operations protested, Solo and Droma informed them that the Yuuzhan Vong were coming. As if on cue, the Yuuzhan Vong indeed arrived just then, and a large space battle ensued. Solo and Droma aided a group of X-wings in destroying a Yuuzhan Vong vessel, and the group of X-wing pilots turned out to be Kyp's Dozen.

Solo had registered with SELCORE\u2014an organization founded by the New Republic in order to settle refugees from worlds ravaged by the Yuuzhan Vong\u2014as a sponsor of the Ryn in order to settle them somewhere, and Droma had decided to aid the Solos in their efforts. The trio administered Settlement 32, which contained two Ryn clans among other refugees.

Wearing chemical suits, he and Jacen led a team of refugees back to the settlement to seek out any spaceworthy vessels that had survived the infestation, only to discover that the settlement had been overrun by Fefze beetles. The team was forced to flee from the swarming beetles, but Droma remained behind with Jacen, using a vibroblade to kill several of the insects.

Droma and Solo were soon located by Yuuzhan Vong warriors and hid in a pile of mowed grass. While hiding, they discovered a cavern housing an old WQ 445 transport. After gathering as many refugees aboard the transport as possible, Droma and Solo realized they were finally saying goodbye to each other, and both regretted having to do so. Droma also regretted that he had never been able to properly meet Luke Skywalker. The comm unit aboard the hauler was dead, which prompted Solo to give his comlink to the Ryn. Before the two parted ways, Solo suggested that at the end of their acquaintance, it was Droma who finally owed Solo. Droma piloted the hauler through a raging space battle above the planet and to a jump point outside of Duro's orbit, escorted by Solo in the Falcon.

The Ryn had traditionally been leaderless nomads, but Droma began to turn what many others in the galaxy regarded as the species' weaknesses into strengths. The species traveled to many places, saw many things, often stowed away aboard ships, spread news to each other via gossip, and were rarely stopped by security; Droma used all of these habits to their advantage by founding the Ryn Network, an intelligence organization which helped undo the damage inflicted upon the galaxy by the Yuuzhan Vong. Near the beginning of 28 ABY, he began running the network out of the Thorny Toe, a cantina on Onadax, and only intended to stay there for three months, believing that dormancy would compromise the network's secrecy.

Droma's agents also reported that the Yuuzhan Vong were planning to attack the planet Esfandia. Droma instructed his agent Goure Conor on Bakura to direct Solo to Onadax; Solo arrived in the Falcon, accompanied by its escort ship, the Galactic Alliance Defense Force craft Pride of Selonia. Solo was summoned by Droma while playing a game of sabacc at the Thorny Toe and was interrogated by the Ryn, who remained hidden and spoke to Solo over speakers, not revealing his identity.

Lying, he told the Solos that he had applied to be a part of the Ryn Network but had been rejected. Hoping to lead the Solos to Esfandia, he mentioned the impending Yuuzhan Vong attack on the planet and asked them to drop him off at Juvex, which was on the way. The Solos realized that Esfandia was one of only two places to contain a relay base servicing the Unknown Regions, which Luke Skywalker had recently led a search party into. As such, the Falcon and the Selonia headed to Esfandia, where they discovered a Yuuzhan Vong armada led by Commander B'shith Vorrik and an Imperial fleet under the command of Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon that had been chasing Vorrik's fleet across the galaxy. Solo pledged the Falcon to Pellaeon's fight and took the ship planetside in order to locate the relay base. After the ship landed on the surface, Droma was the first to hear a strange noise, which turned out to be Esfandia's inhabitants, the Brrbrlpp, who were speaking in trinary code. After Solo's protocol droid, C-3PO, spoke to the Brrbrlpp at length, a plan was hatched to protect the bystanders under the Falcon's shields while presenting the ship as a cold target to the Yuuzhan Vong armada, which would in turn converge and become an easy target for Pellaeon's Star Destroyers. The plan made Droma nervous but was nevertheless set into motion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Yuuzhan Vong bombarded the area around the Falcon, it soon became apparent to the ship's crew that they were trapped. Droma suggested faking surrender and, believing that they were going to die, was ready to reveal himself as the head of the Ryn Network.

Following the Brrbrlpp inside, the ship's crew discovered the hidden relay base, which was being overseen by Commander Ashpidar. Ashpidar gave Droma and Leia a tour of the base, during which she indicated that she believed a traitor to be in their midst. Droma was wary of Eniknar, Ashpidar's Noghri security chief, but joined Solo in taking Eniknar and two other members of Ashpidar's team on speeder bikes to reprogram the base's relay transponder. Arriving at the transponder, they rendezvoused with Jaina Solo and her comrades Jagged Fel and Tahiri Veila.

Droma told Jaina of a trick he had seen Veila perform earlier: using the Force to close the throats of the Tsik-Seru's plasma launchers. Jaina mimicked the move, and the vehicle exploded, but its Yuuzhan Vong pilot survived and continued to pursue them on foot. The warrior knocked Droma out of the way before a distraction by the Brrbrlpp allowed Jaina to kill him. Pellaeon's fleet then defeated Vorrik's, and in the aftermath of the victory, Droma offered Veila a role in the Ryn Network, having received positive reports about her from his agents on Galantos and Bakura.
