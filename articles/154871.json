It could be obtained by killing several Sith acolytes outside the Sith Academy, getting a shard of the holocron every time. Once you have all the shards, the holocron will be given to you. It is required to enter the Sith Academy, and can also be placed in any of your houses as a holocron floating above a pedestal, giving off black smoke. A similar version that does not give off black smoke is available in a Card Assault pack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
