However, during the start of the Jedi Civil War, Kalatosh succumbed to the dark side and joined the Sith Empire. By this time, he wielded a purple-bladed lightsaber. In 3956 BBY, he was present on Taris until he perished in the planet's destruction by Darth Malak. With his physical body destroyed during the bombardment, he became a Force ghost and spent the centuries leading up to the Galactic War on Taris."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3642 BBY, he began wreaking havoc on Taris, resulting in the Jedi Order and the resurgent Sith Empire sending people to resolve the matter. The Jedi sent Ashara Zavros, Kalatosh's descendant from a long line of Force users, and the Sith sent a Sith Inquisitor, Lord Kallig, to subjugate the dark ghost and turn Ashara to the dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Kallig performed the Force walk ritual on Kalatosh and turned Ashara to the dark side, he went on to do the same to Horak-mul. Upon binding both Kalatosh and Horak-mul, the Sith Lord attempted to destroy Darth Thanaton with his newfound power. However, the power of four ghosts proved too much.

He may be absorbed, be freed, or he may be redeemed along with the other ghosts to presumably become one with the Force.
