Representing Jyn Erso, the theme references the dies irae motif. While Giacchino made extensive use of the leitmotif in the score of Rogue One, the musical figure that forms the motif was originally written by John Williams and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra for the 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In A New Hope, the motif is played at Obi-Wan Kenobi's home, after the Jedi Master tells Luke Skywalker that he himself was \"getting too old\" to fight the Galactic Empire. Jyn Erso's theme is played throughout the score of Rogue One, and is featured in the Jyn Erso & Hope Suite."}]}
