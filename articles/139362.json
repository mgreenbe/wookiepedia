Crater was in the dark room and told Graf that he did not need help. This reminded Graf of a story about a pilot in the dark."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A few years earlier, Tallissan Lintra and her fellow Resistance pilots were travelling through a gas cloud. They had to end their training due to the conditions when they received a distress signal. Although Blue Leader would not have any communications\nif she went back in the gas cloud, Lintra did anyways to answer the distress signal. She found the location of the distress signal came from a starship nearby."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Onboard the space station, Lintra investigated and called out to anyone who was onboard. All of the sudden the lights turned on and Staaysha Dekkr appeared. Dekkr told Lintra to not move, assume she was a pirate. Lintra told Dekkr that she was there to help them but this caused the Duros to break down and explain to Lintra why they were in trouble. They had wanted to impress their boss by getting a early docking slot at Klytus V Station but got lost in a shortcut through the gas cloud."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They moved over to the bridge of the ship. The gas cloud was overriding the ship's sensors and unless they fixed the problem they could be stuck in the cloud for a millennium. Coming up with a plan, the two decided to reboot the navigation computer so they can follow exhaust signature left by Lintra's A-wing out of the cloud. They rebooted the navicomputer but before they could follow the signature, Resistance X-wing starfighters came to their rescue."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back on the Star Herald, Crater was feeling better and Graf told him that it was ok to feel afraid and that maybe a nice oil bath would make him feel better."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
