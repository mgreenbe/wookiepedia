Predators and scavengers, they could leap out of the water five meters and glide at least two dozen meters. Opportunists they were, they traveled in packs, following saberjowls and feeding of the larger creatures' leftovers. Their heads boasted a hanging appendage which detected changes in pressure or temperature, helping them find their prey. They were believed to have descended from Kaminoan-cloned b'tan flyers, a species originally from the bayous of Rodia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sounders attacked Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker during the Battle of Kamino.
