It was specifically targeted to affect clone trooper's physiology. The weapon didn't leave any physical trauma, but caused intense pain. The pain was often so extreme that it could cause a sensory overload, killing the victim. Only a delicate neurolaser procedure could stop the effects of the agonizer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
