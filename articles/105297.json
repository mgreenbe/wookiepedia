As a permanent presence here, Thrawn constructed a command post buried deep inside an asteroid, but he seems to have preferred to lead from his command ship, the cruiser Springhawk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Springhawk, rather less than 200 meters on the keel, and armed with missiles and Chiss masers, was apparently typical of Picket Force Two's capital ships; her escort of three hyperspace-capable heavy starfighters was also apparently typical of the patrol elements these ships led. With just three cruisers and their nine fighter escorts, Thrawn routed a force consisting of the Lucrehulk-class battleships Darkvenge and Keeper, six Hardcell-class armed transports, seven Trade Federation escort cruisers, and three thousand Vulture droid starfighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It seems that this small force represented the total combat strength of Picket Force Two, although two transport shuttles and a further force of five fighters were also seen at the asteroid base. The capital ships bore names - such as Springhawk, and the Whirlwind, retrofitted with a Vagaari gravity well projector; the fighters had numerical designations, such as Fighter Four, which performed an important probing feint in the battle against the Trade Federation force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
