Kas'im held the position at the end of the New Sith Wars. The rank of the Sith's Blademaster was on par with the Jedi's Battlemaster. They supposedly knew all lightsaber forms to a degree of excellence that they could instruct pupils in the art. The lightsaber class began in the morning and at the end of the practice session, apprentices were able to challenge each other under the Blademaster's supervision.
