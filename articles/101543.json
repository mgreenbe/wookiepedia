The Solo family once owned a small apartment there on its thirtieth floor, its second floor had a large shopping center, its third floor held landing pads, and its fourth floor contained five tapcafes.[source?] It was built in the Alderaanian style, as it had originally been planned to be the first building in a shelter for those who survived the destruction of Alderaan. However, Coruscant was never popular with the Alderaanians, and after the Siege of Coruscant, the remaining Alderaanian refugees also left, and the Tower became a residential building for the rich."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 ABY, several years after the death of Grand Admiral Thrawn, Lando Calrissian came to Orowood Tower to report to Han Solo and Leia Organa Solo that Thrawn was still alive. The Solos did not believe Calrissian, even though Calrissian claimed to have met with Thrawn. In reality, Thrawn was still dead, and the person Calrissian met with was Flim, a con man who impersonated Grand Admiral Thrawn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
