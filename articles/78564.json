They were later mentioned in the article \"Castaways of Endor,\" written by Wallace and Robin Pronovost and released on December 1, 2008, on StarWars.com for the members of the website's registration-exclusive fanclub, Hyperspace, which has since been retired. The star and the system were later given an entry and placed on a map in the 2009 Del Rey reference book The Essential Atlas, written by Wallace and Fry, in the \"A Closer Look: Endor and the Moddell Sector\" chapter. This section gives a brief description of several astronomical objects, planets, and stars in the sector and supplies historical references and illustrations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some confusion surrounds the sectoral location of the star. The Essential Atlas states that it is located in the Moddell subsector, which is said to be a freestanding subsector, while the newer Star Wars: The Essential Atlas Online Companion says that the Moddell is a subsector of the Zuma sector.
