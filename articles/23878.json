Fisher made a comment once about her experiences off the set of Star Wars films: \"I used to go in though airports and have people say; 'Princess Leia!' Like I would then go; 'Yes?' You know, like that's my real name.\" In an interview on public radio in 2005, Fisher joked about being known overwhelmingly for her role as Princess Leia, and also joked that she was afraid if she ever became senile she might begin to slip back into character."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For The Phantom Menace, she wrote dialogue, uncredited, for the moment when C-3PO and R2-D2 meet for the very first time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In early March of 2013, Fisher confirmed in an interview with the Palm Beach Illustrated magazine that she would return to reprise her role as Princess Leia in The Force Awakens.
