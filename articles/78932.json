After years of study at the Temple's academy, Sageon was selected by a Jedi Master to become a Padawan and travel the galaxy for one-on-one training. During his training, Sageon grew in his knowledge of the Force and crafted for himself a blue-bladed lightsaber before passing his Trials of Knighthood and being elevated to the rank of Jedi Knight by the Jedi High Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sageon served the Order as a Knight for many decades, serving the Jedi Temple as quartermaster, equipping Jedi for field missions for many years.
