As the Jedi confronted Dooku together, the frigate was ambushed by the Republic Venator-class Star Destroyer Resolute.

The droid was in charge of the personal Munificent-class star frigate of Count Dooku, the leader of the Confederacy. Around 21 BBY, the frigate was passing through an ice field when a subordinate droid of the Captain spotted a heavily damaged Delta-7B Jedi starfighter nearby, which contained one life-sign aboard. Upon hearing the subordinate's report, the Captain ordered the starfighter to be towed into the frigate's docking bay and sent a security detail, consisting of B1 and B2 battle droids, to restrain the fighter's Jedi pilot.
