It was considered a second-class manufacturer, although its ships were competitively priced and among the highest quality. Subpro began working jointly with the Incom Corporation in 147 BBY to design and manufacture a number of similarly-shaped starfighters, though it never received a full share of the credit for its part in designs. These included the Z-95 Headhunter and the ARC-170 starfighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their lines of medium combat cruisers and sublight fighters gathered rapid acceptance, but were not as popular as those of other companies.
