Their thick, leathery hide ranged in color from black to dark green to brown. The Hutts were quite fond of the vrblthers, and occasionally kept them as pets. While it was once theorized that they were the mutated descendants of the Evocii, they were actually taken from Varl when the Hutts relocated to Nal Hutta, as there was another species of vrblther still on Varl. In the \"wilds\" of Nar Shaddaa's lower levels, vrblthers typically hunted in packs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While investigating an animal-smuggling ring on Nar Shaddaa, Jedi Masters Mace Windu and Depa Billaba were attacked by a pack of vrblthers.
