The Rapacc system was a box system; a system with unusually strong electromagnetic fluxes which caused even more hazards to vessels entering or exiting hyperspace than elsewhere in The Chaos. The cataclysm  seeded the inner part of the star system, as well as much of its outer parts, with large asteroids and meteors. These posed hazards to in-system navigation to the inhabited planet of Rapacc, leaving only three safe routes from the periphery of the system to that planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
