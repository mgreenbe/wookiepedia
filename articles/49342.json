Mara Jade Skywalker found one in 25 ABY while she and Luke Skywalker were exploring a disturbed ExGal-4 station on the Outer Rim planet of Belkadan. Mara briefly flipped though the pages, noting how its author described the increasingly foul air as well as the station's inability to raise any communication feeds off plant, or even to find the feeds from their satellites. The pages were mostly empty. The journal also made a slight ruffling noise."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
