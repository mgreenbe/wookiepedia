Beam-tubes were first developed over twenty thousand years before the Battle of Yavin. Able to fire energy projectiles, these weapons were far superior to the slugthrowers of the time in terms of firepower. The beams could travel up to fifty meters. Although severely outdated, functional beam-tubes could be found during the time of the Galactic Civil War in backwater sectors such as the Tion Hegemony[source?] and the isolated planet Kegan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notable models"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
