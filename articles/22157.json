Despite this, they were widely unseen in the Republic Navy early in the Clone Wars. It was not until the Battle of JanFathal, where Anakin Skywalker piloted a CIS-owned CR-20 to rescue Republic Intelligence operative Hallena Devis, that the usefulness of the CR-20 Troop Carrier became evident. Generally, they were used in situations where the large Acclamator-class assault ships were impractical or unneeded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
