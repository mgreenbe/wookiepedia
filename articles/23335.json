One of the peaks on Captivity was the Borolol's Claw, which frequently found itself in the low-pressure center of storms and therefore could be used to attempt a starship landing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The hostile conditions of Captivity made it an ideal world for the Galactic Empire to use for exiling prisoners, who were dropped to the moon's surface in escape pods. The individuals exiled on Captivity included the criminal Andews Rolo, who led a gang of other violent criminals, and the former Imperial Navy captain Dedelin, whose smaller group was composed of political prisoners such as Imperial senators."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel Alliance carried out a mission to rescue the politically-important exiles of Captivity. Since the Alliance only dared risk a single starship landing on the moon to evacuate the prisoners, a team of Rebel soldiers tasked with locating the exiles posed as the ruler of the planet Virujansi and his advisors.

A permanent layer of thick and swirling clouds and mist covered Captivity, and the moon's weather conditions were violent with frequent raging storms and occasional rain. The winds were cold, loud, and abrasive, and they carried grit with them. From the moon's surface, the sky featured streaks of blue and brown, and shades of gray, and the daylight on Captivity was gray in color."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shifting magnetic storms ravaged Captivity's surface, which was highly irregular and battered and featured cliffs and other jagged formations of rock and towering mountain peaks.

The hostile conditions of the moon, coupled with frequent TIE fighter patrols from the nearby Grehollo station, made Captivity an ideal prison, with starship pilots unwilling to risk landing there in order to mount a rescue of prisoners."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel Alliance began to suspect that many political prisoners vital to the Rebel cause, including senators and important Rebel sympathizers, were exiled on Captivity. Determining that the mountain peak known as Borolol's Claw could be used to land a rescue ship, the freighter Millennium Falcon, on Captivity, the Alliance nevertheless judged such an attempt to be dangerous enough to only risk it once. Therefore, the small team of Rebel soldiers tasked with locating and rallying the prisoners would have to find another way onto Captivity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon learning that the Empire was preparing to supplant the Rajah and the Royal Court of the Inner Rim planet Virujansi with Imperial officials, the Alliance suspected that the Empire would either execute the Rajah, keep him under house arrest, or exile him to Captivity.

The team was then lured into a seemingly safe cave by Andews Rolo\u2014another prisoner who, unknown to the Rebels, was the leader of the gang. Rolo pretended to be the leader of a small group of political prisoners in order to deceive the Rebel agents into revealing their identities.

Since the Millennium Falcon, which by that time had arrived and was being pursued by a group of TIE/rc starfighters, could therefore not locate the prisoners, the Rebels created a signaling device by using one of the power generators from Dedelin's camp. Several of the TIE fighters also noticed the signal and attacked the group on Borolol's Claw. Eventually, the Rebel team and the Falcon succeeded in driving the fighters away. Captain Han Solo and co-pilot Chewbacca of the freighter transported both the soldiers and the prisoners off Captivity, evading further Imperial starships and leaving the Grehollo system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Captivity was populated by Imperial prisoners, several of them Human, who were dropped on the moon's surface in escape pods.

Thus, it was assured that the pods would be damaged upon landing and would be unable to be used for leaving Captivity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the criminals exiled on Captivity was Andews Rolo. The former leader of the Spectrader Ring gang, Rolo was left alive so that an Imperial Grand Moff could use the threat of the former's return to ensure the obedience of the new leaders of Rolo's gang. On Captivity, Rolo organized other exiled criminals into a brutal gang that eventually exterminated all other groups of prisoners on the moon\u2014with the exception of that led by Captain Dedelin. Since Rolo had eliminated all the other parties on Captivity, defeating Dedelin's group became an obsession for the criminal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The disillusioned, formerly highly popular Captain Dedelin led a group of thirty-three political prisoners.

A number of caves had been worn into a lower section of the cliff. The criminal Andews Rolo used one of the caves in order to deceive the newly arrived Rebels into revealing their identities. The cavern was dimly illuminated by torches and was poorly ventilated, with stinging smoke perpetually hanging in the air. Possessions lying in the cave were bundled together in order to indicate their ownership and to mark specific sections of the cave."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A slippery, gently-downward-sloping side passage led from one of the caves to a natural chamber with a low ceiling. A rapid underground river flowed through a notch it had eroded in the cave's floor.

The encampment could also be reached aboveground from the territory of Rolo's gang by walking along a defile. The camp consisted of well-kept huts that had been painstakingly built from rock, mortar, and a type of wood known as edgelwood. All the tools and equipment in the camp had been either scavenged or made from wreckage of the prisoners' drop pods. The huts were surrounded by a hand-extruded, powered wire fence, with the perimeter of the camp being patrolled by two old guards. The territory of the camp also included several fields used for agriculture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Captivity was the site of the mountain peak known as Borolol's Claw.

The outcome of the duel depends on whether the player-characters cheat during the fight or not."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If the Rebels prevail in the fight without cheating, Rolo decides to get rid of the potential threat to his reign and deceives the Rebels into going to an underground river. Rolo claims that, as a reward for their victory, his gang will let the Rebels retrieve several valuable items from their \"treasure vault,\" which supposedly can only be accessed via the river. In reality, the player-characters are simply carried by the fierce current of the river out of the caves and to the vicinity of Dedelin's camp, where they face the difficult challenge of convincing the camp's guards that they indeed represent the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Cheating or losing the fight"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If the Rebel team does not cheat and loses the fight against Volq, or does not lie in the first place, Rolo's gang surrounds the soldiers.

Upon surrendering or being defeated by Rolo's underlings, however, the Rebel soldiers are taken prisoner and Rolo attempts to ransom them with Dedelin's group in exchange for a power generator.
