In 44 ABY, Terrik invited some very well-known individuals to his personal starship, the Imperial Star Destroyer Errant Venture, for a large sabacc tournament. In actuality, he had brought the sabacc players onto his ship as hostages to prevent the Galactic Alliance from moving to control the Jedi Order, which planned to deploy its forces off the galactic capital planet Coruscant against the wishes of Chief of State Natasi Daala. Terrik used the hostages to force Daala to let the Jedi leave. After the Jedi completed their mission, he loaned the Dust Dancer to the Jedi so they could use it to transport the celebrities back to Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi Master Octa Ramis, along with Jedi Knight Seha Dorvald, piloted the Dust Dancer to the planet Borleias in the Pyria system just before Terrik left his hostages there. The Jedi brought the Dust Dancer into orbit above Borleias, and Dorvald took a shuttle down to the planet's surface. On Borleias, she met with Dolo Karenzi, the night-shift quartermaster of the Borleias outpost, and told him that the Dust Dancer was carrying a load of consumable luxury items\u2014expensive wines, exotic foods, fresh sabacc decks, entertainment datapads, candies, and pastries\u2014with the outpost as the items' listed destination. Karenzi realized that there had to have been a mistake, but he decided to sign for the items in the Dust Dancer and keep them himself, hidden in a storage pod. After the Dust Dancer landed, Karenzi attempted to unload the cargo fast. Right in the middle of the off-loading process, however, the Errant Venture entered the system to drop off the celebrities. Karenzi quickly hid the cargo and made a false manifest for the Dust Dancer so no one would know about the real cargo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi had planned for the Dust Dancer to be the only transport available to send the celebrities back to Coruscant once the Errant Venture left the sabacc players on Borleias, and Ramis and Dorvald piloted the celebrities to the capital aboard the Dust Dancer. Once on Coruscant, the players were ferried by the Dust Dancer's shuttles into the Senate Building. Unbeknownst to the players, however, several Jedi had hidden in the shuttles' smuggling compartments, providing them easy access to the building so they could prepare for a coup against Chief of State Daala."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Commanders and crew"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Former smuggler Booster Terrik received the transport Dust Dancer from a contact and then loaned the ship to the Jedi Order to pick up the celebrities whom Terrik had held hostage after dropping them off on Borleias.
