They studied and manipulated DNA and genes, typically working in laboratories and cloning facilities. Some were formed at the Chandrilan Academy of Sciences. A notable example of genetic manipulation is that of the Kaminoans. Contracted to create a clone army, the Kaminoans used Jango Fett as the template, creating an army that the Galactic Republic would later use in the Clone Wars. After studying cloning processes, ambitious geneticists such as Borborygmus Gog and Mammon Hoole researched on abiogenesis, or spontaneous origination of living organisms from lifeless matter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
