During the New Republic push to take Coruscant in 6 ABY, intelligence indicated that a Star Destroyer named Imperator was part of the defensive fleet guarding the Galactic capital. It was apparently a well-regarded ship, but it is implied that that the squadron defending Coruscant was composed entirely of Victory-class Star Destroyers, which would suggest that this Imperator belonged to this class of smaller, older Star Destroyers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It is known that this Imperator, along with a ship named Emperor's Will, were sent from Coruscant by Ysanne Isard shortly before the New Republic assault, to prepare for the transfer of the seat of the Galactic Empire to another planet.
