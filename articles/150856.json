After a quest on Nelvaan, Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi led an assault against the Confederate forces over Tythe, in an attempt to apprehend Count Dooku. Their starfighters barely made it past the orbital defenses, and once inside the LiMerge headquarters building, Dooku began taunting the two Jedi. Anakin gave into his rage and brought the LiMerge headquarters toppling down on his head, though Dooku escaped to Coruscant.
