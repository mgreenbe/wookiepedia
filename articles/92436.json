They were edible by Artiodacs and sold in the Moncaladrome opera house on the planet Mon Cala. At some point prior to the Battle of Takodana, the chef Strono Tuggs won VIP tickets to an opera about the Faluvian cycle at the Moncaladrome in a game of dejarik. Although he found the first act unsatisfactory, he was served a Mon Cala Sardine Fritter as a canap\u00e9 during the opera's intermission and enjoyed the food far more than the show, eventually learning to cook the dish himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point after the Battle of Takodana in 34 ABY, Tuggs included a recipe for Mon Cala Sardine Fritters in his cookbook, The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook. He also included the story of his visit to the Moncaladrome and mentioned that he was pleased that he could enjoy the fritters afterward without having to put on a suit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mon Cala Sardine Fritters were introduced in the 2019 cookbook Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge: The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook, written by Marc Sumerak and Chelsea Monroe-Cassel.
