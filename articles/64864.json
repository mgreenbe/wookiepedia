It was shortly prior to the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, and was an interservice decoration that was awarded for actions above and beyond the call of duty while engaged with enemies that did not warrant the issuance of the Kalidor Crescent or the Corellian Cross. Although it was an interservice decoration, it was commonly issued to Alliance Army personnel mostly because there were more opportunities to demonstrate exceptional personal gallantry than those in other Alliance branches. The Alliance Navy were also eligible for the award, though starship and vehicle pilots who had five confirmed kills and ace status became eligible."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Crews of vehicles or small starships, such as the crew of a repulsortank, or the gunner of a BTL Y-wing starfighter, or the crew of a patrol ship or gunboat, were eligible for the award in which the pilot of their vehicle during an action was eligible for the award."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Physical description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Illudium Star was awarded as both a wearable medal and as a small bar ribbon that was used in a ribbon rack. The medallion was a five pointed star that was roughly five centimeters across, and was made from polished illudium. At the center of the star was a laurel wreath that surrounded a red enameled Rebel Alliance starbird. The tapered ribbon from which the medallion was suspended from was short, and had a metallic silver with a thin red stripe that ran around its edge. The ribbon-rack ribbon was silver with red stripes on both ends. The Illudium Star could be awarded numerous times, and subsequent awards did not provide more medals, but rather, the individual was awarded a small starbird pin that was roughly five millimeters across on the medal's ribbon for each Illudium Star issued."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Illudium Star was first mentioned in the 2016 Fantasy Flight Games canon sourcebook Lead by Example."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
