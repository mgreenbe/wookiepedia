Located near another celestial body, Kirima had icy and rocky terrain with blue crystals. Around 238 BBY, Jedi Master Sskeer took his Padawan Keeve Trennis to Kirima for training, telling her to leap across a wide canyon using the Force for guidance. Trennis' first attempt failed, but Sskeer caught her with telekinesis and had her try again. Six years later, Trennis, by then a Jedi Knight, remembered the visit while trapped on Sedri Minor with a Drengir-controlled Sskeer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
