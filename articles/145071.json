The book was for sale by the Galactic Archives, a small shop in Trader's Plaza, Talos spaceport, on the planet Atzerri, in 16 ABY. The Galactic Archives advertised the volume in their courtesy cabs, which took customers to their central distribution hub. Jedi Master Luke Skywalker viewed an advertisement for the book in such a cab during a search for information about his mother; it was advertised alongside the H'kig book of laws, Principles of Power, and the Sith book of offerings and rituals, with a discount for the purchase of three or more volumes. The Jedi dismissed the advertised volumes as likely frauds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The book about forming group minds is mentioned in Shield of Lies, a novel written by Michael P.
