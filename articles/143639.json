Kalani wants his prisoners to fight in order to prove his theory that the Separatists had a higher chance of victory than the Republic and Jedi. When Zeb protests that he will have no part in Kalani's war game, the tactical droid agrees with the Lasat on the grounds that his species was not involved in the Clone Wars. Instead, he designates Zeb as the hostage that the other rebels must rescue in a rescue simulation base on 132 Clone Wars battles. Kanan and Rex refuse to fight but Ezra insists that they should take up this challenge as a game. Kanan and Rex then change their minds.

The battle commences at Kalani's orders and a column of B1 battle droids attacks the three rebels.

Rex tells Ezra to stay together as they advance into the hangar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ezra sees the hangar is clear and suggests entering. However, Rex cautions against it because the battle droids' strategy is to keep advancing forwards and calls the rebels to wait. Kanan responds that the tactical droid has had a long time to think.

Together, Rex and the Jedi advance into the hangar.

Meanwhile, Ezra encounters Chopper; who tells him he has sent a distress signal.

When Ezra remarks that he would make a good soldier, Rex points out that their plan was dependent on good timing and chides Ezra for his tardiness. When Ezra tries to explain that Chopper wanted to show him something, Rex warns Ezra that this is not a game and that his every move affects everyone.

Kalani admits that his droid army is depleted but emphasizes that they are not at war with the Empire. Kalani then orders B1-268 to analyze the approaching Imperial forces.

When he asks Kalani what the Separatist were fighting for, the super tactical droid replies that they were fighting for freedom against the Republic's tyranny. Ezra points out that he and his fellow rebels have always been fighting against tyranny.
