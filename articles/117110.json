They were to meet with Cargo Ferry group Fanir to pickup the Airam's cargo of Imperial munitions at the Ytha'ac Cluster in the Ytha'ac system. However, the Imperials had sent a strike force consisting of Assault Gunboats and Gamma-class ATR-6 assault transports to recover the munitions. The smugglers dropped the cargo for Rongo to pick up and then quickly jumped into hyperspace. Rongo then attempted to pick up the munitions and make a run for hyperspace while X-wings provided starfighter cover."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "What happens then depends if the Rebels defeat the Imperials the cargo ferries escape but if the Imperials win their transports will disable the ships and capture them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
