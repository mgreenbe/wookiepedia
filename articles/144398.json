Jann Tosh pilots an RZ-1 A-wing interceptor and escorts the freighter back towards the planet. He mentions that an empty decoy ship has been deployed and dispatched in a different direction in the hopes of discouraging a possible pirate attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As luck would have it though, Captain Gir Kybo Ren-Cha and his pirates, piloting stolen Imperial TIE/LN starfighters attack the freighter ship. They latch onto Jessica's freighter with a tractor beam and bring it back to a hidden mountain base on the watery planet known as Tarnoonga. Ren secures Jessica in his ready room. He becomes infatuated with the young pilot's enthusiasm and brazen demeanor. He decides to keep her as his personal consort."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jann meanwhile, follows the pirates back to Tarnoonga. He sends a coded emergency message to King Julpa informing him of the attack. As soon as he lands within the mountain base, Ren's henchmen swarm upon him and imprison him in the dungeon hold of a sail skiff. Jann is reunited with the droids and the pirates force them to walk the plank into the seas below. A large green sea monster, known as the Miridon, rises from the ocean depths and begins attacking them. R2-D2 activates a propeller system from the top of his dome and begins swimming away. Threepio and Jann grab a hold of Artoo's legs as the small astromech droid evades the Miridon's powerful teeth. Artoo manages to outmaneuver the sea monster and causes it to ensnare itself within the wreckage of a sunken freighter ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Jessica Meade escapes from Ren's ready room. She keeps him distracted with a remote seeker, while she makes her way down the corridor. Ren's henchman, Jyn Obah tries to catch Jessica, but she succeeds in getting back to her ship. She traps Jyn within the blast doors of her freighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back at the sea caverns, Jann and the droids steal a HydroPlane and try to find Jessica.

He captures Jann, Threepio and Artoo and brings them aboard his personal capital ship\u2014a stolen Imperial Star Destroyer known as the Demolisher. Ren sets a course for Tammuz-an.

It turns out to have been the decoy all along, though, and she manages to reach an escape pod before her ship is destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Demolisher approaches Tammuz-an, King Mon Julpa sends out the entire Tammuz-an space navy, recently refueled from the other freighter that had been pretending to be the decoy. Squads of A-wing fighters swarm over the Demolisher and engage Ren's TIE Fighters. Inside the Star Destroyer, R2-D2 sabotages the ship's weapons systems by inverting a proton torpedo tube inside the launch bay. As the ship's systems begin going haywire, Jann, Threepio and Artoo manage to get back to Jann's fighter and escape from the ship. They reunite with Jessica Meade and return to Tammuz-an.
