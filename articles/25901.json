At some stage during his life, as a forfeit for losing a bar bet O'nder was forced to attempt to eat the fuel cell of blaster. He almost died from the resulting injuries and as a lasting consequence his lips were fused together."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In around 31 BBY, O'nder hired out a concealed back room of Saludi's to a group of Twi'lek gamblers. The room contained an entrance to a secret hideout occupied by the Believers, a group of Sith-worshipping cultists from the Cularin system. Unknown to O'nder, the Twi'leks made a profit from renting the room from him by accepting bribes from the Believers every time one of the cultists passed by to enter their hideout."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A team of freelance agents hired by the Jedi, an order of Force users based on Coruscant, ventured to Saludi's in pursuit of the Believers. The agents sought out O'nder, looking for information on the location of the Believers' hideout, but the bartender was unavailable as he was busy preparing drinks. The agents caught up with O'nder when he became free; though he was reticent to disclose anything, after the operatives offered a bribe he provided them with details of how to access the cantina's back room. Shortly thereafter, the agents located the Believers base and confronted the cultists."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "O'nder had only one eye. As a result of his ignoble encounter with a blaster fuel cell, the bartender's lips were fused together at their center and his mouth only opened on either side. Though his conjoined lips impaired his speech, O'nder refused to get them separated because the injury served as a reminder to him not to anything so stupid again. He enjoyed claiming to patrons of Saludi's that the injury was caused by an attempt to pick his teeth with a lightsaber, a type of weapon commonly wielded by Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chez O'nder appeared in Coruscani Dawn, a 2002 roleplaying adventure by Morrie Mullins that formed part of the Living Force campaign."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Coruscani Dawn, the players roleplay as the Jedi-allied agents that come to Saludi's while searching for the nearby Believers base. It is possible for the player characters to interact with O'nder during their inquiries, either of their own volition or after being advised by a spacer patron of the cantina that O'nder was a good person to speak to for information about what went on in Saludi's. The bartender only discloses to the player characters the existence of the cantina's secret back room after significant effort to convince him, including the offer of a bribe. The number of credits required to persuade him to speak is left to the judgement of the gamemaster and depends on how how successful the players' efforts to coerce O'nder have been."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
