They ate with long, sucker-tipped tongues. The creatures were about three meters long (tail included) and a meter high. Small groups of ten formed strong, protective familial bonds. Their flesh was favored by the predatory graiveh and their soft pelts by hunters, so that hunting had to be regulated to prevent extinction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
