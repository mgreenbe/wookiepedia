Bliss gathered a number of criminal allies and enemies on Kijimi for a summit under the guise of partnership, intending to instead execute them and raise the Spice Runners in the galactic underworld. Her plans were foiled by Poe Dameron, a recent member of the Spice Runners and an associate of Zorii, who refused to allow the executions to occur. Bliss overpowered Dameron, but before she could kill him, she was stopped by Zorii. However, Dameron refused Zorii's offer to defeat her mother and take control of the Spice Runners.
