There, the pirates and their descendants created a unique civilization, centered around a sailing ship that was a mobile city. Quarg was succeeded by his equally corrupt son, the younger Governor Quarg. Some of the inhabitants of the city-ship revolted against Quarg's tyranny. The rebels created a new civilization. They used technology to communicate with native Sea-dragons, with whom they formed a symbiotic lifestyle, and thus became known as Dragon Lords. The Sea-dragons willingly allowed the rebels to ride them and took the rebels to dwell in underwater caves. The Dragon Lords waged constant war on Quarg. The baby Sea-dragons infested the city-ship, acting as spies. The crew of the city-ship ignored the babies, thinking them mere lizards, not realizing they were young Sea-dragons."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many years later, the Dragon Lords finally defeated Quarg's son with the help of Leia Organa, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, R2-D2, Chewbacca, and C-3PO, during the Battle of Drexel.
