It consists of 324 cards (162 Dark Side and 162 Light Side cards) and was introduced in 1995. This set consists of 108 rare, 108 uncommon, and 108 common cards. The Premiere Limited set is different from the Premiere Unlimited only in that it has black borders while the unlimited has white borders. This set introduced many of the classic characters from Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. This set, however, did not include such characters and places that were significant in Episode IV like Chewbacca, R2-D2, and the Death Star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This set was sold in 15-card expansion packs and 36-pack expansion boxes. Also, starter decks were available in 60-card decks and 12-deck displays. Each pack included one rare card, four uncommon cards, and ten common cards. The set went out of print in April of 1996 when the almost identical Premiere Unlimited expansion set came out. A Japanese-text set was released for this expansion set in Japan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Card list"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Dark Side"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Light Side"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
