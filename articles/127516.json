Slip-jaws consisted of two fighters crossing into each other's paths, almost but not quite crashing into each other, while unfortunate pursuers smash into one another. The maneuver was possible only for droid pilots or those aided by the Force, as it required an extraordinary level of precision. Slip-jaws was named after the scissor-like mandibles of a Kashyyyk slash-spider."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi utilized this technique during the Battle over Coruscant to escape Vulture Droids who were pursuing them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
