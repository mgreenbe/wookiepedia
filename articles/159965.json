During the reign of the Galactic Empire, it was ruled by Governor Ecressys, who routinely complained of the lack of support given to his regime by the Imperial government in the Core Worlds. After the Battle of Endor, he, like Ubrik Adelhard in the Anoat sector, proclaimed that Emperor Palpatine was alive in a move to prop up his own power, proceeding to establish his own splinter faction independent from central Imperial authority. By the time the New Republic arrived after the end of the Galactic Civil War, Ecressys had plundered the treasuries of hundreds of worlds and fled the capital for the Western Reaches."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
