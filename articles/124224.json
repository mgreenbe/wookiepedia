She, along with her sister Sheeka, was orphaned during a range war on the planet. The sisters later separated when she left Atrivis 7 and joined a religious sect on the planet Devon Four. During the latter years of the Galactic Republic, the sect stopped paying taxes, and consequently the planet was placed under an embargo by Coruscant. That almost destroyed the colony when a plague struck the planet; the inability to import medicines from off-world threatened to result in the death of every member of the sect, including Sheeka's sister. That fate was only averted when Sheeka smuggled medicine onto the planet. Following that incident, Sheeka's sister left the sect and moved elsewhere in the Outer Rim, eventually raising a family with a number of children."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a result of smuggling in the medicine, her sister was placed on a Republic blacklist, and later coerced into helping the Republic forces on Ord Cestus instead of serving ten years on a labor world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Human woman was religious, as evidenced by her joining a sect on Devon Four.
