Generations before the Galactic Civil War, the Pelemaxians tamed native tentacle birds as war mounts, capitalizing on the creatures' savage call, which could scare and confuse enemy soldiers. By the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Pelemaxians had begun using tentacle birds as caravan animals to travel through the forests of their homeworld. The Pelemaxians also sold tentacle birds offworld; such exports made up a major part of Pelemax's economy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Pelemaxians are mentioned in conjunction with the tentacle birds of Pelemax in the book Creatures of the Galaxy, published in 1994 by West End Games. The entry was written by Rick D. Stuart based on an illustration of the tentacle bird by David Plunkett. The book does not indicate whether Pelemaxian refers to a sentient species or is merely a planetary demonym, such as Corellian or Chandrilan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
