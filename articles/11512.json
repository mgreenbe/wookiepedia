During the hijack, BNI's master was killed along with the rest of the clone personnel, but she survived with a small group of other droids. BNI managed to learn the identity of the target the Separatists planned to destroy and revealed it to D-Squad when she hoped to escape the ship when the Renown exited hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When a buzz droid was caught spying on the droid survivors, astromech droid R2-D2 chased the droid into the gunnery room followed by BNI and the others. The droids were later ambushed by a swarm of buzz droids, and M5-BZ sacrificed himself to remove the buzz droids from the room. He opened an airlock, which sent the buzz droids into hyperspace, along with himself, in order to to save the others. BNI and the others later escaped the doomed Star Destroyer on a shuttle before it exploded, sending a catastrophic wave of debris to the station and the fleet around it. BNI and the others were later returned to safety under the protection of the Republic and were all assigned to the same squad for the rest of the war as it escalated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
