Plasma rotors formed a vital part of the weapon, as they were charged prior to each burst of ionized particles. After each shot, the technicians had to allot some time to clean up residual ionized particles in the cannon before firing again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unfortunately, the cannons took their tolls on the Malevolence as well. The sheer power of the cannons was very difficult to control; after firing the weapons, some of their energy would leak back into the cruiser, temporarily depowering on-board systems in the process."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Separatist flagship Malevolence gained infamy at the start of the Clone Wars, when it used its ion pulse cannons to destroy entire Republic task forces.
