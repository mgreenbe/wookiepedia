The Millennium Falcon had one installed as standard, though Han Solo used it sparingly despite the fact that he modified it with a Carbanti Whistler encryption module."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The transceiver had both video and audio pickups, and an interface port allowed it to connect with droid brains and other computer systems. The antenna consisted of twelve kilometers of tightly wound, ultra-thin superconducting wire that allowed it to achieve a broadcast range of approximately forty light-years, and the receiver constantly scanned standard frequencies for distress calls and hails from other vessels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
