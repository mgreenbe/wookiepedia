Because of this, Mygeeto meant \"gem\" in the ancient trade language of the Muuns. Mygeeto's internal fires had long since cooled and had left a colossal deposit of precious stones within its crust and mantle. The immense assets of nova crystals and fields of lasing crystals made Mygeeto one of the wealthiest worlds in the galaxy. It hosted artesian crystals and relacite. The planet's ice shelves were home to a species of huge and aggressive worm-like creatures. In addition, the planet itself was enveloped by an asteroid field."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mygeeto was not composed of a uniform terrain; instead it was composed of many different kinds of terrain. There was no reported volcanic activity on the planet, meaning that the planet's interior was stable. The immense amount of precious metals found in the crust supports the theory that Mygeeto's volcanic activities had been dormant for some time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Few cities existed on Mygeeto's sunken surface. These cities drew power from synthesized crystals which were constructed in large capacitor towers that stored and distributed the valuable energy drawn from the crystal. These cities were used mainly for administering the surrounding crystal mines, though they also contained vaults which were used by the InterGalactic Banking Clan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nearly all of the planet's surface was covered in thick ice, and the polar climate caused massive snow storms that battered the frigid surface almost continuously. Before the giant ice age, Mygeeto had a climate ranging form polar to temperate\u201430% of Mygeeto was covered in polar ice caps and 70 was either tundra or temperate.\nTemperature varied between -47 degrees in polar areas to 17 degrees in equatorial areas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Every 200 years or so, Mygeeto would go through a snow shift meaning snowfall would be persistent and low pressure would dominate the northern hemisphere.

Around 30,000 BBY, an alien species known as the Rakata annexed Mygeeto as part of their Infinite Empire. The Lurmen were forced by the Rakata to shape Mygeeto's crystal formations, but with the break-up of their empire after five thousand years of galactic dominance the Rakata abandoned Mygeeto and retreated to their homeworld of Lehon."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Dark Age"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 6740 BBY, the planet was rediscovered by smugglers, with Hutts and then Neimoidians taking control of the planet in the following years."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "InterGalactic Banking Clan"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Muun-controlled InterGalactic Banking Clan discovered Mygeeto, the native Lurmens were reduced to a status little better than slaves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to easily mined formations of naturally-occurring, high-quality crystals and jagged rocks present on the planet, the InterGalactic Banking Clan guarded Mygeeto with a fleet of warships including Munificent-class star frigates. As a result, access by rivals to the planet was difficult. Even if intruders had bypassed the blockade, they were faced with the harsh, frozen surface of the planet itself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi had always wanted to explore the planet because of the large supply of natural crystals suitable for lightsaber construction, but the Banking Clan would not allow it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Banking Clan also constructed several cities on Mygeeto. These cities were used for administering the surrounding crystal mines, though they also contained vaults which were used by the Banking Clan to store its treasures. Mygeeto had even become the sister world of the Muuns' own homeworld, Muunilinst and like Muunilinst, Mygeeto was an economic rival of Coruscant itself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Banking Clan's rule of Mygeeto, the planet was administered by Caar Damask. The Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Tenebrous, under the guise of starship designer Rugess Nome, brought Caar and a Force-sensitive female Muun together. Their son Hego Damask was born on Mygeeto and would go on to become the Sith lord Darth Plagueis, who would later return to the planet with his apprentice Palpatine at the beginning of his training. Caar owned a residence here on Mygeeto which is where Plagueis grew up."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Mygeeto became a valuable member of the Confederacy of Independent Systems and was as a result named by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine as part of a \"Triad of Evil\", alongside Felucia and Saleucami."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, General Ki-Adi-Mundi led the Republic assault on the world along with Commander Bacara and the elite Galactic Marines. The planet would be the site of many horrific battles during the Clone Wars, beginning in 21 BBY. By the conclusion of the battle in 19 BBY, the vast cityscape lay in burning, ash-filled ruins. The hot ashes mixed with Mygeeto's ice crystals to cover the battlegrounds in sleet and snow. Many Republic vehicles, including UT-ATs, were blown apart by Confederate tri-droids. Later, Ki-Adi-Mundi's forces were reinforced by troopers from the 501st Legion sent by Palpatine himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Officially, the 501st Legion had been sent to destroy a droid energy collector, but in reality they were searching for an experimental power source that Palpatine required for a top-secret tributary laser-stream project code-named Hammertong to power the Death Star. Clone Troopers destroyed two turbo laser turrets so that Ki-Adi-Mundi could land. After landing, Ki-Adi-Mundi led an assault on the energy collector, securing the power source that Palpatine had been looking for. Finally, he sent the power source offplanet to Coruscant, and aided the Republic troops in battle. Towards the end of the conflict, Commander Bacara received Order 66 and killed the Jedi General. Following the assassination, the remaining pockets of droids were eliminated, thus ending the two year-long battle and the Confederacy's presence on Mygeeto."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Mundi's death and the resolution of the Clone Wars, the newly established Galactic Empire enslaved the planet, claiming it on behalf of Palpatine, who had now taken on the title of Emperor. The Imperial war-machine would keep strict control in the turbulent times following the Clone Wars; they extensively strip-mined the planet for a mineral known as durasteel, used in the construction of starship hulls. However, unlike other factions of the CIS, the Empire did not destroy the IGBC, which would have doomed the galaxy to a crippling recession, but rather subjugated the government."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Civil War and after"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, Mygeeto fell into the hands of the Alliance to Restore the Republic.
