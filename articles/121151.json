It was most notably used on the V-wing airspeeder deployed by the New Republic during the Galactic Civil War. The boosters allowed the V-wing airspeeder to reach maximum speeds of up to 1400 kilometers per hour, but only for a short period of time. It needed cooling down for reuse. Overuse of the booster could cause severe damage to the craft."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
