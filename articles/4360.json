Aboard the Eternal Crusader, they tracked Ship to a planet in the Maw, where they met Abeloth, a mysterious woman who pretended to befriend and assist the Sith. Still, the strike team suffered heavy losses, and Xal planned to initiate a coup against the team's leader, Lady Rhea. Before the betrayal could be executed, however, Ship returned to the Sith and transported them to Sinkhole Station, a space station in the Maw. There, they ambushed Skywalker and his son, Ben. Xal, however, had ordered Raas to kill Khai as part of his coup against Rhea. When Khai threw her grenades at the Skywalkers, Raas pushed them back at her. Rhea, however, had anticipated his betrayal and had given Khai false grenades to throw first. As Raas attempted to apprehend a seemingly stunned Ben Skywalker, Khai killed Xal.

Khai called her uvak, Tikk, and she and Raas took the creature to find the ship. They found the spherical vessel in the middle of the Temple courtyard, where many Sith had already gathered, and the ship began to speak to Khai through the Force. The Tribe, having finally acquired a way to leave the planet, began to use the ship to attack and capture starships to form an armada. In 43.5 ABY, Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker touched an Aing-Tii relic, the Codex, sending out a call through the Force which alerted the Tribe to the threat he presented.

The team, aboard the warship Eternal Crusader, followed Ship, using Khai's unique connection to the Meditation Sphere to track it. This caused some unrest among the crew, and the Sith debated why it would allow Khai to track it, as well as what it was doing to begin with. Raas suggested that it was leading them into a trap, and, though Lady Olaris Rhea, the strike team's leader, agreed, she decided that they had to follow it anyway. They tracked it to a planet in the Maw, where Raas and Xal were chosen by Rhea to be a part of the search party sent down to the planet to find Ship. On the planet they met Abeloth, a powerful being who pretended to help the Tribe, while actually sabotaging their efforts to escape with Ship. Meanwhile, Raas was tasked by Xal with getting closer to Khai and gaining her trust in order to stage a coup against Rhea, so Xal could take over the strike team's leadership."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the search continued without success, Rhea finally decided that they should just leave without Ship, and Xal decided that it was time to execute his coup. Before either of these could happen, however, the Meditation Sphere suddenly reappeared. As the search party took up pursuit, Rhea was attacked by a siphon reed and pulled into a whirlpool. Khai jumped in to save her master, and as they resurfaced, Raas grasped them in the Force to bring them safely to shore. The search went on fruitlessly, and several more Sith arrived on shuttles from the Eternal Crusader to join the search party until there were no crew members left aboard the ship. Eventually, however, Abeloth discovered Skywalkers location, and allowed Ship to return to the Sith.

They were commanded to ambush the Skywalkers with grenades, but Raas was ordered by Xal to betray his friend and Force push her grenades back at her when she threw them at the Skywalkers. When the Jedi arrived on the scene after escaping from their first confrontation with members of the strike team, Khai and Walusari threw their grenades at them, and Raas and Xal quickly pushed the explosives back at the two Sith as they threw their own stun grenades. Rhea, however, had expected treachery, and had provided Khai with fake grenades. Meanwhile, the Skywalkers pretended to have been knocked unconscious, and Raas prepared to restrain the younger Jedi. Upset by Raas' betrayal, Khai threw her shikkar at Xal, killing him.

He was also rather compassionate, and cared deeply about Khai; however, Khai shared no romantic feelings for him. He wasn't afraid to speak out among higher-ranking Sith, as he offered his theory to Rhea as to why Ship was allowing only Khai to track it. Later, Raas was troubled by Xal's orders to gain Khai's trust in order to betray her.

During the battle with the Skywalkers, he and his master underestimated the Jedi, believing incorrectly that stun grenades could incapacitate them. Raas was distracted by Xal's cry of pain as the Sith Master was killed, resulting in his own death.
