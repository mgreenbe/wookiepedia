His mission is to recruit blockade runner pilots to help the Rebel Alliance evacuate their base on Yavin 4. However, while he is there he finds some clues to a secret plan of the House of Tagge working with the Empire, but not enough to find out exactly what they are up to. He goes to Mos Eisley to continue his original mission, and reunites with Han Solo and Chewbacca in the same cantina where they had originally met months earlier. But the celebration is cut short as Fixer arrives to warn Luke that the Empire is aware that the young Rebel is on Tatooine and actively searching for him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
