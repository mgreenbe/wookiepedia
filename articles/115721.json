However, Delarhg did not panic; instead, he again found an area with a robust Imperial bureaucracy, where he used his verbal skills and bureaucratic knowledge to acquire another high-paying, low-effort job. The former governor repeated this pattern of flight, relocating to another Imperial bureaucratic center, and talking his way into a cushy position (regardless of whether that position actually existed prior to his arrival) numerous times."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Riggins Delahrg was a short, heavyset man who possessed a white shock of hair atop his head.

He was also unethical, living up to the immoral stereotype of Imperial Governors held by many, engaging in extortion, taking bribes, and committing outright theft."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Delahrg carried with him a datapad that stored a number of official-looking forms; several recording rods; a variety of rank insignia, code cylinders, decorations, and uniforms (some of which were either stolen or forgeries); and 5,000."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
