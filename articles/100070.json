As the Corellians began to interact with other Core Worlds over thousands of years, Basic words and phrases flooded the Corellian lexicon, forming the latter Corellian language. After over twenty thousand years of intermingling, Old Corellian nearly vanished approximately four thousand years before the Battle of Yavin. With the ascension of modern Corellian, Old Corellian became a relic preserved by linguists and conservatives wishing to remember the forebears of Corellian society."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The language was kept alive in two noteworthy groups: Corellian colonists and Corellian fringers.
