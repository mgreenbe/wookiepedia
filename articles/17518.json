After the Battle of Yavin, the Black Sun discovered that the Rebel Alliance was smuggling a new kind of spice. Around 1 ABY, the Black Sun acquired a sample of this new spice after the smuggler Cal Handro crash-landed on Rori. The chemist Tover Blackmoor analyzed the spice in the bunker and discovered that it was nothing like any other spice available on the marker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Black Sun leaders therefore decided to obtain more of that spice and started to track Cal Handro, the missing pilot who vanished after his ship crashed. They also set up a trap for a group of spacers who had found spice in Handro's crashed ship while searching for the missing pilot. A woman by the name Kaila Min contacted the spacers and pretended to have met the pilot on the run in the wilderness of Rori. The adventurers indeed rushed to the coordinates provided by the woman, only to be attacked by the Black Sun. However, the spacers killed all attackers and found the coordinates of the Black Sun bunker on a datapad. The spacers then attacked the bunker, hoping to find the missing pilot, and killed many Black Sun henchmen during the assault. They eventually found the chemist Tover Blackmoor and forced him to reveal everything he knew about the pilot and the new spice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Black Sun bunker was a location in the 2003 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars Galaxies, prior to the game's closure on December 15, 2011.
