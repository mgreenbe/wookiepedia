On Corellia, Jenra had fragrant, ice-cold fruit cider available in her lounge, and the young human Qi'ra drank half of the pitcher without pause. In Black Spire Outpost on Batuu, a seasonal hot beverage called Spiced Surabat Cider was available from restaurants such as Ronto Roasters with and without alcohol. Spice Runner Hard Cider, a foamy and warming local cider, was available on tap at Oga's Cantina.
