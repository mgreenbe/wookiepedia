He required a rebreather due to his chronic respiratory condition, which he got from digging near Jedha's kyber mines. Cole-Truten had a reputation, at least with Baze Malbus, of selling particularly wretched worms. In 0 BBY, Cole-Truten was in Jedha City when it was targeted by the Galactic Empire's Death Star, and was killed in the destruction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dobias Cole-Truten was first shown in the reel of promotional footage released for the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story at Celebration Europe on July 15, 2016.
