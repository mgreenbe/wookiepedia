Having constructed a blue-bladed lightsaber, Rune escaped execution when the Galactic Republic's Supreme Chancellor Palpatine betrayed the Jedi through the initiation of Contingency Order 66. As the Order was disbanded and the few survivors scattered, Rune was placed on a list of other Jedi survivors by the newly formed Galactic Empire. By 1 ABY, he had a sizable bounty placed on his head, becoming one of the Bounty Hunters' Guild top ten most wanted fugitives. At this time, an unknown bounty hunter tracked down the Jedi and killed him, collecting the long-standing bounty."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rune, along with several other fugitives of various backgrounds, ranging from murderers to Imperial deserters, is part of a kill collection in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided.
