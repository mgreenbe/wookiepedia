The armor protected a wearer's head, torso, arms and legs and could be reinforced with the addition of steel wire or mesh. Flex-amor was designed to be more flexible and maneuverable than dura-armor. Modifications to the armor could improve its resistance to physical attacks at the expense of protection from energy weapons. Republic soldiers equipped with flex-armor were not concerned by this as most battles were fought with weapons such as slugthrowers and swords. The popularity of flex-armor waned when energy weapons became commonplace on the battlefield."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
