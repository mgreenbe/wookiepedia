Its members were just beginning their training; with the ages averaging around three standard years old. The Clan was trained by a Jedi Master; at the time of the Incident at the Jedi Temple, the clan was tended to by Ali-Alann."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a string of robberies at the Jedi Temple, the clan was aboard a turbolift that ran horizontally across the Lake Level. The shaft was sabotaged as the group was traveling to a refectory. When the sabotaged shaft fell apart; leaving the car dangling over the lake, Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was not a member of the Jedi Order at the time, was forced to help evacuate the younglings onto one of the catwalks. With the arrival of the Jedi Council members, the group was swiftly brought down to safety."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
