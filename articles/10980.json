After a pursuit in Vargo Spaceport on Varkana, the spy got caught and 2BR-NTB was destroyed. Later in the same spaceport, Tagrin caught Team Colossus members Kazuda Xiono, Jarek Yeager and CB-23 by trapping them in his ship, the Dalkor Dagger."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to CB-23 sabotaging one of the ship's engines, the Dalkor Dagger crashed back onto Varkana before Tagrin could turn his prisoners over to the First Order. As the Resistance members attempted to make their escape, Kev and Xiono fled on a speeder bike while Synara San, Yeager, and CB-23 were captured by Tagrin.  Tagrin brought them to Commander Pyre, but because two spies were still at large, he didn't receive his bounty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tagrin was persistent to catch the spies until he discovered Kev and Xiono disguised as stormtroopers and overheard Xiono mention his shuttle parked outside the spaceport. After finding Xiono's shuttle, Tagrin broke in and used signal-tracing to locate the Colossus, which was hiding in a nearby gas giant, for the First Order. In the meantime, Xiono and Kev helped Yeager and San escape and ran back to their shuttle, where Tagrin was hiding in the back. While Xiono and Kev were starting the shuttle, Tagrin revealed himself and ambushed them. He almost captured Xiono and Kev, but with the help of CB-23, they managed to take out Tagrin and retreat from Varkana."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ax Tagrin wore custom armor, with a removable faceplate.
