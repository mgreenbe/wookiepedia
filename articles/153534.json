One gambler fled, while the other played him and lost. The Jedi Knight then remarked on how an honest person would only fear losing, while a cheater would fear discovery. The construction worker Ganzer, a patron of the bar who had twice lost to the hustlers, witnessed this. In 34 ABY, Ganzer, who by then was the bartender of Ganzer's Grotto on the planet Cantonica, told the story of the Jedi Knight to his friend Kaljach Sonmi while they discussed The Lucky Three, a trio of Suerton gamblers whom Sonmi had recently encountered."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Knight was mentioned in John Jackson Miller's 2017 short story \"The Ride\" in the novella collection Canto Bight, released as part of the Journey to Star Wars: The Last Jedi multimedia project."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
