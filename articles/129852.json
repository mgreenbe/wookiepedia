The spore sickness was especially common among offworlders, who had not yet adjusted to Drongar's unique environment. For this reason, incoming starships regularly cleaned their ventilation systems before and after arriving at Drongar. In most cases, spore sickness caused damage to the lungs, forcing the body to battle the spores by raising the body temperature to exceptionally high levels, essentially cooking an individual in their own body fluids. However, the spores were only dangerous when encountered in the atmosphere. At ground levels, the spores appeared to be harmless. Spleen-rot was one such disease."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
