While the Viscount was visiting the Garden of Butterflies the shapeshifter changed into the form of a rare butterfly with a poisonous sting and set off to attack Tardi. However, Princess Leia Organa quickly observed that the butterfly was approaching Tardi and she ordered R2-D2 to spray it with fire retardant.
