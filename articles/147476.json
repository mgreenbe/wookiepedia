He gained the prestigious position of Sava from the former Sava, the female Ugnaught Korin Pers, by ruining her reputation because he hated her and her ideals; she respected the extinct Jedi Order and the Force. While serving as the Sava on the planet Bar'leth, Toob-Nix acquired a group of extremely dangerous Abersyn symbiotes, organisms that were banned ownership of by Imperial decree, so he kept them hidden. Also around this time, Toob-Nix grew to hate one of his students, the aspiring archaeologist in training Chelli Aphra. He later passed away in 0 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
