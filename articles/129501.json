Publicly, the Sphere was responsible for the protection of Imperial secrets and dangerous lore that should not be shared. Followers, such as Lord Anathemos, would scour the galaxy in search of holocrons and other sensitive data to lock away. The Sphere was also covertly responsible for the management of assassins and the removal of high-risk targets to the Empire. The Sphere was led by one of the twelve members of the Dark Council, and during the Great Galactic War the head of the Sphere was Darth Ekkage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ekkage was famous for her command of the Red Legion, but she was captured during the war and imprisoned on Belsavis.
