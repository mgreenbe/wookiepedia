The image used for the painting came from the art book From Pencil to Pixel: The Art of Star Wars Galaxies. The painting was one of nine paintings given out randomly to players of the game for the game's first anniversary of release in the United States and Europe. The painting was later added to the \"rare loot system\" in Hotfix 17.10 on October 7, 2010. The system allowed players to loot rare items from any enemy in the game. The vehicle depicted in the painting bears similarities to the T-47 airspeeder. The player could use the painting in their house as decoration."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
