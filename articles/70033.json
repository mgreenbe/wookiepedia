While they possessed considerable combat skills and had somewhat extensive knowledge of the Force, Sentinels blended both schools of teaching and amplified them with a series of non-Force skills, such as in the fields of security, computers, stealth techniques, demolitions, repair, or medicine. These skills tended to take the forefront in their middle-road approach to problems; while a Guardian might bash down a locked door and a Consular might simply knock, a Sentinel would instead use equipment available or ingenuity to pick the lock. While the role of the Sentinels within the Jedi Order had remained largely consistent throughout its history, the branch of study was first documented by the Sentinel Jedi recruiter Morrit Ch'gally in the text The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Overview"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Within the Jedi Order, the spirit of the Jedi Sentinel had always existed, with many Guardians and Consulars building a strong connection to the galactic public whom the Order professed to protect. These Jedi were more service-oriented, seeking out cities rather than temples, crowds over solitude. Jedi Knights pursued the Sentinel field of study as a specialization of their specific discipline, in the same way that a Consular might become a healer, or a Guardian might aspire to be a Peacekeeper."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While it was unclear when the Sentinels became their own unique discipline, rather than a specialization within another school of thought, some historians described Master Morrit Ch'gally as the founder of the practical discipline. Ch'gally served as a member of the Army of Light and a Jedi recruiter with the Acquisition Division, and he believed that the differences between his line of thought and the Guardians and Consulars were distinct enough to warrant its own branch of study. Driven by Ch'gally's vision, Sentinels flourished in the postwar era that followed the Ruusan Reformations and spread into the galaxy, where they became some of the Order's most recognizable members. Many served as freelance law enforcers, and were respected as Jedi that could be approached with any problem. When the Galactic Empire came to power at the end of the Clone Wars, the Sentinels suffered less casualties then the other Jedi in service to the Order due to their nature to remain anonymous, avoidance of temples and their proclivity for working in city environments. However, those who did not die during the execution of Order 66 were ruthlessly hunted by the Inquisitors of the Empire. Because of the local populace's familiarity with them, the Sentinels were easily and eagerly turned over by opportunists seeking to gain credibility with the new Empire. While many died during the Great Jedi Purge, others fled into the depths of the cities they served, becoming vigilantes in the night, working anonymously."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Philosophy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While studying all of the traditional techniques and abilities that made the Jedi who they were, the Sentinels of the Order found their isolation in the Jedi Temple to be a hindrance if they were expected to be able to work with the civilians of the galaxy. While adherents to the Force and all that it could do, Sentinels were not blinded by faith and realized that the mystical energy field did have its limitations. Typically opting for missions requiring them to stay in a single place for long periods of time, the Sentinels would take on assignments not suited to the other Jedi branches."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rarely lit lightsabers of the Sentinels usually produced a yellow blade. Few in numbers, Sentinels had no superior titles such as Sage or Warrior Masters of the other two branches. Instead, they focused on the variety of techniques needed to be successful as a Sentinel. Known for practicing more specialized Force techniques, a form of Force Immunity was favored amongst those in this class. Crossing Force-based training with increased mental conditioning, this ability allowed them to better withstand outside mental influences, including Force-based attacks. The most notable Jedi Sentinel serving the Galactic Republic during the Jedi Civil War was Bastila Shan, who, while still a Padawan, mastered the ancient and difficult art of Battle meditation, using it to great effect during the defeat, capture, and redemption of the fallen Jedi Revan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Great Galactic War, the Cold War and the Galactic War, \"Sentinel\" referred to Jedi Knights who specialized in wielding dual lightsabers and using the Jar'Kai variant of Shii-Cho, Ataru and Juyo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though many of the other Jedi classes were hunted to extinction during the Great Jedi Purge, Darth Sidious personally suspected that many of the survivors were Sentinels due to their tendency to serve on distant worlds, their ability to integrate more easily into society, and their secretive nature. Their teachings and ideals of this branch lived on in a recovered version of The Jedi Path. While the New Jedi Order did not initially reinstate the title, their roles were filled by the new Jedi filling out the Order. Grand Master Luke Skywalker considered Masters Kam Solusar and Kyle Katarn to be prime examples of what that role signified. As of 137 ABY, when the Third Jedi Purge was in still in effect, the Order had begun to use the title, though many were slaughtered during the reign of Darth Krayt. The Sentinels who did survive felt personally responsible for failing to see the resurrection of the Sith scourge and began to hunt down members of the One Sith in hopes of rebuilding the galaxy and the Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Specialized paths"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sentinels focused on a variety of fields, some with honorifics in the Order, others with skills taken up by professionals in the rest of civilization. Applying their abilities to the art of the slicer, technician, spy, and security experts, the Sentinels also took on very specific titles in the Order."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Jedi Artisan"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trying to understand creativity as a central aspect of the will of the Force, the craft pursued by Jedi artisans typically manifested in the construction of lightsabers and holocrons.

Republic law required all newborns undergo testing, with potential candidates' names being recorded in the Division's prized Kyber memory crystal. After the child had aged a few months, the Order would dispatch a recruiter to test the child and see if they met the qualifications to begin training on the Jedi Path."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Jedi Shadow"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A highly respected and secretive group of Jedi, the Shadows went farther than the Investigators in their hunt for the truth. Working closely with the Council of First Knowledge, the Shadows sought and destroyed all traces of the Dark side of the Force, and its adepts.

The Technical division of the Order was staffed by tech experts who specialized in the maintenance of droids and other mechanicals, a skill rare among the generally anti-droid members of the Order. Developing a special technique known as mechu-deru, many were able to see the intuitiveness behind the complex structures that composed droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Security experts and slicers maintained their skills at the Temple by running through practice courses devised to test their abilities and the skills of their trade. Without the Force to assist them, these two skills were largely developed through unassisted training and the gift of years of hard work. The quartermaster of the Jedi Temple worked to ensure that all Jedi equipment had been updated and that the storehouse at the Temple was always stocked with the latest technology."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The term Jedi Sentinel was created solely for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic as one of the Jedi starting classes, and only later appeared in the pen-and-paper Saga Edition of the Star Wars Roleplaying Game as a Talent Tree for the Jedi class. This class is mostly signified by its use of yellow lightsaber blades. In Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, the prestige class that corresponds to Jedi Sentinel is Jedi Watchman; the dark-side counterpart is Sith assassin. The Jedi Watchman class also appears in other Legends works, such as the Tales of the Jedi comics and others.
