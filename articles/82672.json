They were tasked with the physical security of the Authority's facilities, such as farms and factories. The importance of the facility determined the number of personnel and equipment assigned to the location. Mechanically maintained waste converters might rate only a single officer, while power stations required a staff of hundreds. Locational Enforcement operatives worked as undercover investigators and forensics specialists; they assisted Security Police in their investigations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The organization of Locational Enforcement directly mirrored the structure of Territory Administration. Each Territory had an OverPrecinct assigned to it to handle duty assignments and personnel. Regions were served by a Precinct, Zones had a Sub-Precinct, and Markets included a Station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
