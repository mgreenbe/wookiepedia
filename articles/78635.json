While he did not support the New Republic, Gartfran joined the Resistance to  fight against the First Order, which he saw as worse. Fiercely independent and a born survivalist, the Resistance's base in the jungles of Ajan Kloss appealed to Gartfran, as he felt at home in the absence of civilization. In 35 ABY, he was present in the base as the Jedi-in-training Rey and her allies prepared to depart for the planet Pasaana. As the protocol droid C-3PO said farewell to the astromech droid R2-D2 before departing, Gartfran was sat on a log in front of the X-wing fighter of pilot Poe Dameron, speaking with Vober Dand and another member of the Resistance's Ground Logistics Division."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
