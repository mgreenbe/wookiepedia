Each film began with a distinctive opening crawl rolling up against a backdrop of stars. Around 120 BBY, it comprised at least twenty-four instalments, and was still popular by 6 ABY. Though considered entertaining holofilms, professional historians like Thunys Albegron were somewhat skeptical of their historical accuracy, counting them as \"decicred-dreadfuls.\" Episode XXIV: Death on the Rim, set during the Kymoodon Era, was an installment of the series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "True Tales of the Ancient Republic was conceived as an in-universe series that was intended to be included in 2012's The Essential Guide to Warfare. Jason Fry, the author of the book, intended to write this section to portray the Hutts as being as monstrous as possible, instead of depicting them as comic relief. The opening crawl and the overall nature of the section also included meta elements that were meant to affectionately parody Star Wars itself and a certain other science-fiction series. Although both Fry and Erich Schoeneweiss agreed that it was a fun section and that the Hutts needed to have their vile natures emphasized, it was cut to shorten the manuscript and reduce the number of sidebars in the book."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
