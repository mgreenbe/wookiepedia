During the Clone Wars, a Republic conference was held in the system, at the Valor space station. In 11 ABY, the system was destroyed after Kyp Durron launched a resonance torpedo at the system's star, Caridan, from the superweapon known as the Sun Crusher. Nova Station was later built there as a waystation on the Perlemian Trade Route.
