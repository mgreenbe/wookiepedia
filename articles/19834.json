Boyrake joined the Imperial Navy shortly after the formation of the Empire and had a long career that lasted over twenty years, eventually reaching the rank of captain.

By the time of the Battle of Yavin, Captain Boyrake retired after being injured in a battle. Struck in the head, Boyrake realized he always wanted to be a pirate. The Imperial Captain retired on the planet Lok and started to gather information about local pirates, notably the Canyon Corsairs.\nAround 1 ABY, Boyrake encountered a spacer in the Imperial Outpost on Lok and provided the location of the Canyon Corsair's Stronghold to this adventurer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boyrake was a non-player character (NPC) in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the nature of some characters in Galaxies, Boyrake's gender and appearance was randomized during each server reset.
