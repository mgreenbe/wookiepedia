Together with Thrawn, Pellaeon participated in the Imperial blockade of the planet Lothal until it was liberated by the rebel Spectres and their allies shortly before the Battle of Yavin. During the liberation, all Imperial starships present were destroyed by flocks of the space-faring purrgil, and Pellaeon's communication with the Grand Admiral was quickly cut off."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Serving the Third Fleet"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the reign of the Galactic Empire, Gilad Pellaeon was an Imperial officer who held the rank of captain during his deployment with the Imperial Navy. He served as the commanding officer of the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Harbinger in Grand Admiral Balanhai Savit's Third Fleet, though the Grand Admiral was not satisfied with the degree of Pellaeon's personal loyalty to him. During the fleet's anti-piracy campaign in the Esaga sector, Savit ordered Pellaeon and the latter's first officer to meet him to discuss a pirate-hunting mission. However, unbeknownst to Pellaeon, the Grand Admiral himself had hired the pirates in order to steal components from Project Stardust, which saw the construction of the Death Star superweapon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not long after, Grand Admiral Thrawn of the Seventh Fleet, who aimed to remove Savit from command by exposing his treachery, asked Savit to turn over the captive Assistant Director Brierly Ronan to him and sent coordinates for a rendezvous. Savit traveled to the prearranged star system with four Star Destroyers, including Pellaeon's Harbinger, and met with Thrawn's flagship, the Star Destroyer Chimaera, commanded by Commodore Karyn Faro. Suspecting an ambush, Savit sent the Harbinger to sweep a nearby space station, which was actually used by Savit's pirates, as a precaution in order to keep Pellaeon away from a possible conflict. Faro subsequently transmitted evidence of Savit's complicity to the Third Fleet personnel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Savit's three remaining Star Destroyers engaged in a skirmish against the Chimaera. During the battle, Pellaeon reviewed the evidence against Savit and concluded that an official inquiry against the Grand Admiral was justified. Pellaeon then called for Savit to surrender his command, as well as calling on fellow Captains Lochry and Rasdel to join him. Pellaeon further placed the Harbinger under the command of Faro. Following Savit's arrest, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin reassigned Pellaeon and the Harbinger to the Seventh Fleet, believing that he might prove useful to Thrawn's ongoing struggle against the Lothalite insurgents."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial blockade of Lothal"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 BBY, prior to the Battle of Yavin, Pellaeon took part in the Empire's orbital blockade around the planet Lothal as part of Thrawn's fleet.

The Grand Admiral subsequently contacted Pellaeon to inquire about the situation, and the captain reported that their attackers had come out of hyperspace, before their communication was quickly severed. Moments later, Thrawn discovered that the Imperial vessels were destroyed by flocks of purrgil\u2014massive, whale-like creatures that were naturally capable of traveling through hyperspace\u2014as part of Bridger's attack.
