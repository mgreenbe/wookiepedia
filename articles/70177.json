Exceptions to this funeral practice were made in times of war, when a body was left in an extreme environment, or in very rare cases when the Jedi used a technique to retain their identity after death, and therefore, physically disappear upon their death. The case of Qui-Gon Jinn was different, his body did not disappear, but he still appeared to Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi numerous times in the following years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Knights also adopted this ceremony as their own, as evidenced by the last rites of Emperor Roan Fel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
