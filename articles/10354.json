Taking place at a point between 25 ABY and 26 ABY, the assault was preceded by an attack on the Vinsoth system, where the Yuuzhan Vong split their forces to strike several target systems including one group that traveled to the Axxila system and then used a hyperlane, which connected Axxila to the Tangrene system via several other systems, to reach the Vandyne system. After the attack on the Vandyne system, the Yuuzhan Vong advanced further along the hyperlane to attack the Edusa system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack on the Vandyne system was first shown in The Essential Atlas, a sourcebook released in 2009 and written by Daniel Wallace and Jason Fry. The Atlas included the attack in a map titled \"Vector Prime and the Yuuzhan Vong advance\" which showed the movements and conflicts of the various factions involved in the Yuuzhan Vong War, between 25 ABY and 26 ABY. The book gives no information on the outcome of the attack, but a separate map shows the Vandyne system was under Yuuzhan Vong control by 26 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
