The smugglers took refuge in a cave, and Parck dispatched a ground team and several starfighters to locate them and the two downed Imperial fighters. In the process, they discovered the abandoned dwelling of what appeared to be an unknown species.

Parck quickly came to suspect that the alien Barris had encountered had stowed away aboard the shuttle that had brought the surviving troops back from the surface.

Impressed by his resourcefulness and intrigued by the alien's desire to protect his people from assorted dangers, Parck offered him a position in the Imperial Fleet, phrasing it as an opportunity to put the Empire's resources to work against the threats of the Unknown Regions.

When Thrawn, who was an active player in Imperial Court politics, was ready to return to the Unknown Regions and exert the Empire's influence, he and Palpatine staged a court scandal. The political fallout forced Thrawn into exile on a lowly mapping expedition to the Unknown Regions, or so it was thought. Parck, who backed Thrawn in a move so clearly unprofitable that it became notorious among the court, was likewise exiled with him and demoted to the rank of commander. In fact, Parck was one of a few select individuals who knew that Thrawn's exile was staged and had quite deliberately put himself on the losing side in order to be assigned to the expedition, which was entirely orchestrated by Thrawn and Palpatine to allow Thrawn to conduct his mission of Imperial expansion in secrecy."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mission to the Unknown Regions"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Parck was assigned to the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Admonitor, Thrawn's new flagship, as first officer to Captain Dagon Niriz.

Taking the opportunity to further test Niriz, Thrawn shared the details of his plan with Parck but not Niriz. The admiral convinced Creysis that the Admonitor was a colonization ship and dispatched Parck to negotiate with Creysis as part of a fictitious \"Council of Colonists,\" taking a golden sculpture as a gift for Creysis's assistance. The admiral allowed Parck's Zeta-class shuttle to be captured by the Ebruchi. Niriz found Thrawn's performance intolerable, and so did General Larr Haverel, the ship's infantry commander. Haverel approached Niriz with a plan to mutiny, suggesting that their admiral could not possibly be so incompetent and must in fact be in league with Creysis. Niriz passed Thrawn's test when he refused to mutiny, sticking proudly to naval regulations and his sense of tradition and propriety."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Parck took the opportunity to learn more about the Ebruchi while waiting for Thrawn to spring his trap. When Creysis sent the tracker-equipped sculpture to his masters to demonstrate the Admonitor's worth as a target, Thrawn launched his TIE fighters against the pirates. At the same time, stormtroopers erupted from Parck's captured shuttle, easily overwhelming the assembled pirates and rescuing Parck and the shuttle's crew.

By 0 ABY, Thrawn's forces had come into conflict with Nuso Esva, a powerful warlord who had decimated several societies in the Unknown Regions. Esva repeatedly turned down Thrawn's offer of a treaty and launched a campaign against some of the territories that Thrawn had pacified. The worlds under Esva's control stretched to the edge of the Empire, and Thrawn believed that Esva was planning to extend his influence into Imperial Space. Several months after the shock Rebel victory at the Battle of Yavin, Thrawn returned to the Empire to seek help in his campaign against Esva, leaving Parck in command of Task Force Admonitor in his absence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Thrawn was away, Parck led an attack force comprised of the Admonitor, two Strike-class medium cruisers, and four Carrack-class light cruisers into battle against elements of Nuso Esva's navy at Teptixii. With the enemy fleet composed of eight Firekiln capital ships and twenty-seven escort vessels, Parck knew that they posed a serious threat to his forces. While he waited for reinforcements to arrive, Parck had his escorts sweep in front of the Admonitor to block fire from the Firekilns, while the Star Destroyer focused on destroying the smaller enemy ships in order to leave the Firekilns vulnerable. Parck had the enemy ships pinned down when the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Chimaera arrived in the system. Parck was surprised to find another Star Destroyer in the Unknown Regions, but with his reinforcements still twenty minutes away, he contacted Captain Calo Drusan aboard the Chimaera and requested help in finishing off Esva's fleet. Drusan agreed and, as the Chimaera moved to outflank the enemy, Esva's forces fled to hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the battle, Parck was contacted by Drusan and Lord Odo, an apparent representative of the Emperor who was traveling aboard the Chimaera. Odo relayed to Parck a request from General Kauf Ularno of Poln Major in the Candoras sector for help in putting down a potential insurrection. Although not unsympathetic to the situation, Parck explained that his forces could not abandon their mission in the Unknown Regions and initially refused to help. However, upon receiving a transmission reporting the attempted assassination of the Candoras sector's governor, Bidor Ferrouz, by Rebel insurgents, Parck reluctantly agreed to assist. While the Admonitor traveled with the Chimaera, Parck contacted the rest of Thrawn's fleet, instructing them to rendezvous in the Poln system.

Thrawn, however, was one step ahead of the warlord and was waiting in the Poln system aboard the freighter Lost Reef. While Parck deployed his forces in orbit of Poln Major, Esva made his move. Having infiltrated the Chimaera under the guise of Lord Odo, he killed Drusan and locked the ship on a collision course with the Golan Space Defense SpaceGun defending the planet. Esva's fleet entered the system, and Parck moved to engage but, even after Thrawn and Commander Gilad Pellaeon of the Chimaera devised a plan to turn the Star Destroyer from its course and bring it back into the fight, the Imperials were heavily outgunned. Throughout the engagement, Thrawn and Esva mocked each other until Thrawn tricked Esva into revealing his intentions to dominate those who joined him. Only after relaying Esva's words to the Unknown Regions as a warning to others did Thrawn spring his own trap, sending a signal to the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader, whose Death Squadron was waiting nearby. With the arrival of Vader's fleet, led by the Super Star Destroyer Executor, the battle turned in the Imperials' favor. Esva's Eastern Fleet was decimated, though the warlord himself escaped and, with two more fleets operating in the Unknown Regions, remained a significant threat.

Eventually, Thrawn organized his conquests into the Empire of the Hand. Thrawn placed his headquarters on the planet Nirauan, inside a building known as the Hand of Thrawn due to its distinctive shape. It was this fortress that gave the Empire its name. It was made up not only of conquests, but also of planets that willingly joined. This empire, unlike Palpatine's, was tolerant of non-humans, fitting Thrawn's meritocratic style. A major component of the Empire of the Hand was Syndic Mitth'raw'nuruodo's Household Phalanx, an organization of Chiss supporters of Thrawn who worked on the margins of and even deep within Chiss society to recruit numerous warriors to Thrawn's cause."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, Emperor Palpatine was killed at the Battle of Endor, and the Empire began to fragment and lose territory to the New Republic. Thrawn and Parck remained in the Unknown Regions to continue their work, but Thrawn, by this point a Grand Admiral, remained in contact with the mainstream Empire and had some degree of cooperation with Ysanne Isard, Palpatine's eventual successor. It was this connection that gained the Empire of the Hand another crucial servant, Imperial fighter ace Baron Soontir Fel. Over the years, Thrawn stopped Nuso Esva's expansion and began to push the warlord back. By 8 ABY, the remnants of Esva's fleet were in hiding, and the warlord had taken refuge on the planet Quethold, having manipulated the Quesoth Queen of the Red into an alliance. With several other threats requiring the Empire of the Hand's attention, Thrawn could not afford a lengthy blockade of Quethold and sought a decisive victory. While Parck was primarily charged with coordinating the search for Esva's scattered fleet, he joined Thrawn's senior officers and representatives of the Stromma\u2014whose world had been liberated from Esva's rule by the Empire of the Hand\u2014at a number of strategy sessions before the assault on Red City.

In Thrawn's absence, Parck became an admiral and took command of the Empire of the Hand. Thrawn remained in contact with Parck, who was fully appraised of Thrawn's strategies as supreme commander. Conversely, Thrawn, who was well-known for his centralization of information within himself and minimal dispersal of it to his subordinates, informed no one within the Empire of the existence of the Empire of the Hand. This meant that when Thrawn was unexpectedly killed in 9 ABY by his bodyguard, the Empire of the Hand's existence was completely lost to the galaxy at large. Before Thrawn's death, the Grand Admiral left instructions that, were he ever to be reported dead, Parck was to continue his mission in the Unknown Regions and wait ten years for his return.

Having had no contact with Thrawn, Parck was unsure of the accuracy of the rumors and wished to be completely certain that the Grand Admiral had returned before revealing the Empire of the Hand's existence to the Imperial Remnant. Parck was in fact right to doubt, as the \"Thrawn\" of the rumors was in fact an impostor, hired as part of a scheme by Moff Vilim Disra to seize power within the Remnant.

To stop Jade interfering, Parck ordered her detained until they had contacted Bastion and Fel suggested wounding Jade to force her into a Jedi healing trance which would prevent her escape. Before Parck's Chiss guards could act, however, the conference was broken up by Skywalker, who cut his way into the room and rescued Jade, escaping to the hidden sublevels of the base. The clone of Thrawn was killed in a flood of the lower levels caused by Skywalker and Jade's escape attempt, and before Parck could dispatch a scout craft to Bastion, Jade remotely steered her ship into the Hand's hangar, disabling the base's ships.
