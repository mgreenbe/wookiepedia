The Imperials, bearing no love for the New Republic but despising their Yevetha captors even more, took control of their ships at a key juncture in the Battle of N'zoth, killed most of the Yevetha crewmen, and escaped to Emperor Palpatine's throneworld of Byss in the Deep Core. Upon learning of the planet's destruction some years earlier, the squadron split up, with some joining the Imperial Remnant, others defecting to the New Republic, and others departing for points unknown."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
