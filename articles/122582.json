Therefore, Jabba paid bounty hunter Cad Bane to get the Galactic Senate Building's blueprints from Amidala's protocol droid, C-3PO. However, 3PO did not have the blueprints, but he revealed that his counterpart, Anakin Skywalker's astromech droid R2-D2, did. Bane was thus able to get the blueprints after capturing R2, before returning both droids with their memories of the events erased so as not to draw suspicions. Returning to Jabba's Palace on Tatooine, Bane was then paid for the blueprints. Jabba, with the Council's approval, hired Bane to carry out the mission to rescue Ziro.

However, as they make their way towards the landing platform, Bane's bounty hunters were then surrounded by Commander Fox's detachment of the Coruscant Guard called in by Taa and Palpatine. However, Bane refuses to surrender threatening set to kill the senators. Thus, Bane and his bounty hunters were allowed to leave. The senators were then able to wake up Skywalker and Amidala gave him back his lightsaber, saying he dropped it.

As a distraction, Bane shot out the engine of a transport ship in the portal, which spun out of control and began heading for a packed landing platform. The Jedi managed to divert the ship away from the landing platform, leading it to strike the side of the portal instead. On the other side of the wall was the home of the Martez family. While their mother and father saw the ship coming, they sacrificed their lives so their daughters, Trace and Rafa, could escape.

The Jedi then left, but both of the sisters were left disillusioned about the Jedi and the view of them as heroes. With the loss of their parents, Rafa instilled a view in her sister that the two of them could only rely on each other.
