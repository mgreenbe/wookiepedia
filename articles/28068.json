Later on, at night, the Trandoshans captured a Wookiee, Chewbacca, and Clutch and Goron brought him to Island Four. However, Tano, along with two other previously captured Padawans, O-Mer and Jinx attacked the cruiser. Goron left to handle the prisoners while Clutch piloted the ship. Goron was soon struggling with O-Mer and Jinx while Tano sneaked inside the ship and crept towards Clutch. However, Clutch suddenly whirled around and fired at Tano, using his shotgun. Tano dodged every shot and tackled the burly Trandoshan. During the struggle, they accidentally overloaded the ships control, causing it to spin out of control. Clutch made one final attempt on Tanos life by firing on her but Tano Force Pushed him out through the window, killing him. Goron was also killed when he fell off the ship and the three Padawans along with Chewbacca survived and escaped to the jungle while the ship crashed. The next morning, Clutch and Goron's bodies were retrieved from the ship's wreckage by the rest of the Trandoshans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
