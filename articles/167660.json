She trained in the ways of the light side of the Force and served as a member of Jedi Master Saba Sebatyne's all-Jedi Wild Knights starfighter squadron during the Yuuzhan Vong War. By 43 ABY, she had attained the rank of Jedi Knight. Around this time, she and fellow Barabel Jedi Knight Dordi considered starting a nest with Sebatyne's son, Tesar Sebatyne. In 43.5 ABY, several young Jedi Knights began to fall prey to a mysterious illness that caused them to believe that everyone they knew had been replaced by impostors, and the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances decided to deal with the psychotic Knights by encasing them in carbonite. The Jedi Order resisted this, however, and secretly kept as many of the ill Jedi as possible hidden in the New Jedi Temple on the planet Coruscant to be studied."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To prevent Galactic Alliance Security forces from finding and capturing these Jedi, Captain Han Solo and his wife, Jedi Knight Leia Organa Solo, decided to smuggle them offworld to the planet Shedu Maad.

Solo maneuvered the Falcon behind PharmCom Orbital Processing Plant One, an orbiting pharmaceutical production plant, and the Fast Death stayed behind, to be replaced by another pursuit frigate, the Quick End. Solo then told Allana to alert Master Sebatyne, and proceeded to order Zal and Dordi to pull up their guns and targeting computer systems as a bluff. Sebatyne arrived with a squadron of StealthXs and quickly scattered Bolt Squadron. Wilyem then fired a proton torpedo, which detonated a few kilometers off their stern. Solo pretended to spin out of control toward the Quick End, and revealed to the Galactic Alliance that he had Allana\u2014who was disguised as his adopted daughter \"Amelia\"\u2014on board. The frigate then maneuvered out of his way, and at Solo's orders, Allana reached out in the Force to Organa Solo, signaling her to leave.

The Barabels were outraged at first, and demanded that since they had seen the nest and their eggs, Amelia and Warv would have to stay until the eggs hatched. Amelia, however, suggested that she tell them a secret about herself that was as important as the Barabels' nest, and revealed to them her true identity as Allana, daughter of Jedi Jacen Solo and Queen Mother Tenel Ka Djo, and thus the rightful heir to the Hapes Consortium.
