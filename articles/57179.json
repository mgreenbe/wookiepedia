Around 3670 BBY, after the Sith Empire's victory in the Seswenna sector, Greik caught wind of an Imperial plan to attack the Mid Rim world of Bothawui. In an effort to outmaneuver the Republic's foes, Greik proposed the risky tactic of amassing the entirety of the Republic Navy above the world. The decision proved to be a prudent one, and when the Imperial Navy's strike fleet attacked Bothawui, all of the Sith's ships were destroyed with minimal Republic casualties."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
