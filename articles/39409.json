Once inside the ship's hangar, he put up a fight in order to make his capture look convincing. He was defeated and taken to a prison cell. Obi-Wan Kenobi then infiltrated the ship to release him in order to help apprehend the Count. Dooku escaped in his solar sailer with the two Jedi on his tail in a Sheathipede-class transport shuttle. Direct hits on the solar sailor forced the Count to make an emergency landing in a wilderness on the nearest planet. When the Jedi suffered a hit from a droid fighter, they were forced to crash land, as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In a nearby cave, the two Jedi began to hunt for Dooku, but the Dark Lord of the Sith ambushed them by causing a sudden collapse in the cave ceiling, causing Anakin to lose his lightsaber, which Dooku retrieved. This distraction allowed Dooku an opportunity to exit and seal the cave with Anakin and Obi-Wan still inside. While the Jedi tried to find a way out, Dooku came upon Hondo Ohnaka's pirate gang salvaging his ship. Outnumbered, the Count considered his options and chose to accompany the pirate gang on their ship off the planet as a ransom to the Separatists, or a prize to the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, the Jedi inadvertently disturbed \"the mother of all gundarks\" in the cave as they were trying to find their out.

Upon arriving in the Twilight, the Jedi were met at gunpoint and escorted to Hondo, who arranged a meeting with their prisoner."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Anakin and Obi-Wan entered Dooku's cell and subtly mocked his current imprisonment, Dooku relished in the thought that the Jedi would soon join him in captivity.
