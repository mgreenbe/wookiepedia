During the war, he came to know a woman with whom he fathered a child, Sconto. At some point after the child's conception, he was killed in the wars that spanned from 22 to 19 BBY and consequently never knew his son. After his birth, Sconto's mother told their son about his father and that he had been a clone trooper, a fact he told others with pride. Sconto harbored resentment towards the Jedi for their perceived treachery against the clones and held them responsible for his death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sconto's father was first mentioned in the 2019 junior novel Force Collector by Kevin Shinick."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
