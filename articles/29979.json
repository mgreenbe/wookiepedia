During the Galactic Civil War, industrial saboteurs tried to steal the company's tursturin supplies. As the company didn't want to involve local or Imperial law enforcement agencies to avoid questions about the tursturin's provenance, they hired an independent strike team to destroy the saboteurs and their stronghold.
