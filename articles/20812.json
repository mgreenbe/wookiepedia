There were two types: one had a spiral flute structure, while the other had a straight flute structure. These tools were made of very hard, brittle steel, and could have broken off inside the screw if too much torque was applied, making the removal much more difficult."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
