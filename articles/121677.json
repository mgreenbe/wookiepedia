When the Jedi arrived near Kandra Nilitz's landspeeder, they were again ambushed by several Sith Sabers of the Lost Tribe of Sith, which were again commanded by Tola Annax. Grand Master Luke Skywalker, his son, Ben, and outcast Sith apprentice, Vestara Khai, fought the Sith. After the skirmish had come to an end, the Jedi took the landspeeder, in a hurry to find Abeloth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
