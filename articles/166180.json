A member of the same species as fellow Councilor Yoda, but about half his age, Yaddle trained dozens of Padawans in her time as a Jedi Master, including Oppo Rancisis, who would later join Yaddle on the Jedi Council, and the brash and overconfident Empatojayos Brand. After completing Brand's training, Yaddle did not take another apprentice, as she was almost five hundred years old when Brand passed the Jedi Trials for Knighthood."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During her time as a Jedi, Yaddle represented the Jedi Council on many off world missions. She went to Asmeru in 33 BBY with a group of Jedi including Vergere, Saesee Tiin, Depa Billaba and Qui-Gon Jinn, as well as his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi, where they were attacked by Nebula Front members, but managed to defeat them. Yaddle was also part of a six-member team of Jedi Councilors sent on a peacekeeping mission to Malastare, to mediate a meeting between the Lannik government and Red Iaro rebels. After being attacked by Red Iaro terrorists, Yaddle saved the lives of her fellow Council members, and, although the mission was in the end unsuccessful, there were no Jedi casualties. Yaddle's final mission took place in 26 BBY. She, along with Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker, were sent to Mawan to attempt to restore peace to the lawless world. Yaddle sacrificed her life to save the people of Mawan, using the Force to absorb a deadly chemical weapon unleashed by Granta Omega.

They had been sent to liberate the planet from the Advozse warlord known as Tulak, who held the planet unlawfully in his tyrannical grip. Polvin Kut had planned to enlist the assistance of a small resistance movement, who were angry with Tulak's exploitation of the people of Koba. However, the two Jedi were betrayed by Tulak's spies within the Koban resistance before they had even reached Koba's outer moon. Tulak, who had come up against the Jedi many times before and held a deep hatred for the Jedi Order, set up an ambush for the two peacekeepers. The Advozse madman used his vast amounts of Koban slaves as warriors against Kut and Yaddle in battle over the Koban Gorge. Polvin Kut, who was not as completely impervious to the dark side as most Jedi, had been tracking Tulak for decades after the Advozse murdered his family. Surrounded by Tulak's slaves and soldiers, who were brandishing primitive axes and blasters, Polvin Kut let revenge affect his reactions, and, more importantly, his judgment. In an vain attempt to kill Tulak, Kut left himself open for attack, and was killed and beheaded by Tulak's slaves, leaving his Padawan Yaddle alone against dozens of vicious fighters."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imprisonment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yaddle was captured and imprisoned in a chamber deep underneath the ground by Tulak, and subjected to various forms of torture. However, the green-skinned Padawan did not give in to Tulak's torture, refusing to tell him when the next Jedi would arrive to challenge the brutal Advozse warlord after many interrogations. Yaddle simply replied that Tulak's reign of terror would end. Tulak, furious that Yaddle was not buckling under torture, decided to keep Yaddle as a hostage, even though she would not submit to his questioning."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After reaping everything and everyone he could from the planet, Tulak decided that he had had enough of Koba, and prepared to make his way to another world, leaving his trusted marshals to watch over the remote planet. All of Tulak's previous attempts at breaking Yaddle had proved unsuccessful, and his original plan to exploit Yaddle's young naivety had failed. Rather than killing his captive, Tulak cruelly imprisoned Yaddle for life in her underground pit, in case she ever became useful as a hostage in the future."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tulak soon forgot of Polvin Kut's young apprentice, although the people of Koba did not. Yaddle's wardens taunted and jeered Yaddle through a gap in the ceiling in order to gain favor with Tulak's marshals. Yaddle stayed in solitary confinement in her underground prison for over a century, and her only source of provisions were the wardens, who sent down baskets of fruit and vegetables for a time, however as supplies on Koba ran low, the wardens became so preoccupied with their own survival that they slowly forgot about the \"One Below\". Yaddle's existence became the stuff of legend, and although a few pitiful beings continued to send food down the shaft as a sort of ritual, Yaddle relied on the Force for survival."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During her many decades of isolation, Yaddle reflected upon the lessons of her late Master again and again\u2014she embraced and eventually achieved unity with the Force. Many vicious predators wandered into Yaddle's cave, and she too learned the art of combat\u2014an aspect of the Force she had little experience in\u2014for survival, using a simple wooden stick to defeat vicious creatures several times her size.

Large shifts in the planet's mantle had caused powerful earthquakes all over Koba. The impoverished people of Koba, still recovering from Tulak's tyrannical reign, were not prepared for such natural disasters, and could do nothing to stop the remains of their once-spectacular civilization fall to pieces. An earthquake caused a minor avalanche in Yaddle's pit, and for the first time in over a century, the young Jedi Padawan saw daylight. Yaddle's happiness at finally escaping did not last long. She sensed suffering and despair all around her\u2014what had remained after the various famines and plagues had now been decimated by the earthquakes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yaddle had long since forgiven the past generations of Kobans who had acted as her jailers, and she felt deeply sorry for the people who were suffering because of Tulak's oppressive time in charge. She provided as much help to the Kobans as she possibly could, and, with the Kobans struggling to rebuild their broken society, Yaddle declined a request to return to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to resume her Jedi training, declaring that she would not return while her work on Koba remaining unfinished."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the work was difficult, and the resources had been almost depleted, the people of Koba were inspired to continue rebuilding their broken world by Yaddle's spirit and dedication. They built a bridge in Polvin Kut's name over the gorge he had been killed in, in honor of the late Jedi Knight. Yaddle became the savior of the Koban population, but she refused to accept any honors or rewards. She worked with the children of Koba, teaching them what she had learned as a Jedi Padawan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tulak's son, Kalut, had replaced his father as warlord, and had come to Koba to claim his inheritance. Kalut was even more ruthless than his father, and intended to take whatever was worth taking from the devastated planet, and then leave it for good. He fired upon the villages, destroying much of what the Kobans had rebuilt. Kalut and his fellow Advozse soldiers arrived at Yaddle's village, disgusted at the poor condition the villagers were in. Deciding they would be useless as slaves or warriors, Kalut stole the Kobans few valuables. Although the Kobans were too weak to fight, Yaddle was not. She challenged Kalut, and when he refused to leave the Kobans in peace, Yaddle engaged him in a duel. Yaddle, using only the wooden stick with which she had honed her combat abilities during her imprisonment, defeated the Advozse dictator, liberating the Koban people."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mastery"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Yaddle returned to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, the Jedi Council determined that she had achieved unity with the Force and that she did not need any additional training. The Council proposed that Yaddle be elevated to the position of Jedi Master, and offered a seat on the Jedi Council, even though she was still a Padawan. Master Yoda, feeling that it was too strong a deviance from the typical Jedi Code and Jedi training, was the only Council member against Yaddle's elevation. However, through examining her story and through a quick glimpse into her future, Yoda backed down, and allowed Yaddle to join the ranks of the Jedi Council despite still having some doubts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After becoming a Jedi Master, Yaddle went on to train dozens of Padawans, including Oppo Rancisis and Empatojayos Brand. Rancisis, a Thisspiasian male, was a shrewd tactician and a practitioner of battle meditation, and eventually joined Yaddle on the Council.

Yaddle had knowledge of the journals of Tharence Wo, which contained the little known fact that the Yinchorri, like the Hutts, were completely immune to mental manipulation by the Force. Several teams of Jedi were sent to the Yinchorri system to deal with the crisis, including many Council members, but Yaddle stayed behind with some of the less military-minded Councilors, including her former Padawan Oppo Rancisis, Quermian Master Yarael Poof and Grand Master Yoda."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With many of the Jedi Councilors gone, and with the Yinchorri being manipulated by a third party, the Jedi Temple was attacked by a group of Yinchorri.

Yaddle, wielding a green shoto lightsaber helped defeat the vicious invaders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Yinchorri were all killed, Yaddle went to further study the holocron of Tharence Wo, as the teams of Jedi had not discovered the Yinchorri command center which they were searching for. Tharence Wo mentioned a fourth, unknown world; a lifeless rock named Uhanayih known as \"within world\" in the Yinchorri tongue. Yaddle, as well as Tharence Wo, had previously assumed the world to have only mythological meanings. However, with the command center still undiscovered Yaddle began to wonder if the name was used literally, and that the command center might have been inside the fourth planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She told the Jedi Council of her suspicions, but they were interrupted by a message from Master Windu. The teams of Jedi had located the hiding place of the command center, and Yaddle's theory was correct; the Yinchorri headquarters were located inside a lifeless world close to the Yinchorri sun. The Jedi on Yinchorri were successful, but the mission was not without its losses.

The people of Lannik had endured a devastating war against the Red Iaro for several years, with heavy casualties on each side. In 32 BBY, the Red Iaro declared a stalemate, wanting to begin the peace process and rebuild the planet. It was decided that the negotiations should take place on a neutral planet, and the Gran governors of Malastare expressed interest in hosting the meetings. The Judicial Department of the Chancellor requested that Jedi be sent to the jungle-planet to act as arbiters between the two groups.

The military adviser to the Lannik Prince, Hutar Zash, offered the seven Jedi transport in his two speeders. On the way to their destination, the Lannik drivers turned on the Jedi. To the Jedi's surprise, Hutar and the others revealed their allegiance to the Red Iaro, and showed the Jedi explosives strapped to their chests. While Yaddle's group managed to defeat the rebels in their speeder, the other team did not fare so well. Even Piell, Mace Windu and Adi Gallia were thrown off the speeder, and eventually caught onto part of a Podracer belonging to the Dug Sebulba. Sebulba managed to shake them off, but Adi Gallia managed to fire a grappling hook at the podracer. However, the wire was severed when Aldar Beedo's attempt to shoot Sebulba missed.

However, Zug did not get far\u2014he was sucked into the engine of a podracer, and died instantly. The corrupt Grannish senator Aks Moe, accompanied by several Gran soldiers, arrived just after Zug's death, feigning that he had no knowledge of the plot to kill the prince.
