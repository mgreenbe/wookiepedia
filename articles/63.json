It was used when a thief needed to remain in a building open to the public after it was shut for the night or some other event. Thieves would conceal themselves in a suitable position, for example a cupboard, and simply wait until the building was locked and either empty or very sparsely manned. They would then proceed with the robbery."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
