Born around 3954 BBY, Vaner greatly resembled his father at the time of the Jedi Civil War, having Revan's dark brown eyes, fair skin and shoulder length dark brown hair. The Human male's name was an anagram of his father's, but unlike both his parents, Vaner was not sensitive to the Force and therefore never joined the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vaner became a politician instead, developing into a major leader in the time of rebuilding following the Jedi Civil War, and he was a candidate to run for Supreme Chancellor in 3900 BBY.

In 3900 BBY, Vaner and his family visited his mother on the anniversary of her marriage to Revan, who had disappeared before Vaner had been born."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vaner's situation of not being born Force-sensitive despite being the son of a powerful Force-sensitive was repeated generations later with his descendant, Theron Shan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
