This particular soldier took part in a mission to Jabba's Palace and the takeover of Mandalore, among many of his fellow Mandalorians. Specifically, he led a group of Death Watch warriors to liberate a group of imprisoned members of the Mandalorian Guard as one of numerous public stunts set up to allow Death Watch to win the people's favor. After Pre Vizsla's death, this soldier welcomed Maul as the new Ruler of Mandalore, but later defected to the Mandalore resistance led by Nite Owls leader Bo-Katan Kryze. He helped Obi-Wan Kenobi escape Maul's men so that Kenobi could inform the Galactic Republic of what had happened."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This Death Watch soldier also had a position of rank during his time in Death Watch, as he sported the Death Watch rank insignia on his shoulder pads, black markings on his helmet, and the stylized mythosaur logo on his chestplate.\nHe had light skin, blond hair, light blue eyes.
