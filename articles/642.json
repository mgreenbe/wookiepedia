Equipped with powerful laser cannons, it excelled against heavily fortified defenses, but its slow speed left it vulnerable to rocket turrets. Thanks to its shield generator, the Saber-class had an exceptional beam defense for a ground-based vehicle. The Saber-class repulsortank also spawned a scout variant, the Scout-class 2-M repulsor tank."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was used in combat on Tatooine shortly after the Battle of Yavin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 2-M Hover Tank originally debuted in the video game Star Wars: Empire at War.
