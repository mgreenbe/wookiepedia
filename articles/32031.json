He ran Tosche Station after the Battle of Yavin, along with his warehouse manager Janus. Circa 1 ABY, spacers approached Cuan with an inquiry about a droid recently acquired by Janus from the Jawa traders of Sand Crawler 345. The spacers were hired by Imperial Commander Barrezz as well as Rebel Captain Bastra who both were looking for the droid. Cuan replied that he had no idea about the droid's location, though Janus might have. He informed them that Janus had crashed his speeder bike earlier that day, and he gave the spacer the location of his employee. After arriving at the location, the spacers would report to Cuan that Janus had been killed by Desert Demons. Cuan Talon was also friend with an old woman named Sorna and tried to help her as often as possible."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cuan Talon was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
