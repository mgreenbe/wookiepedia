By the fifteenth year of the Galactic Empire, the V-35 was outdated, and therefore inexpensive. At the time, it could often be found on Outer Rim planets such as Lothal. Five years later, Owen and Beru Lars still owned one of these landspeeders, which they kept on their homestead on Tatooine. They used it frequently for trips to Anchorhead, where they bought supplies and sold their hydroponically grown goods. The V-35 was characterized by a sharply angular nose, three raised repulsorlift thrusters, and a large barrel-shaped power plant. It featured a one-driver, open-air port."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
