Rangoon infiltrated BlasTech Industries after he learned about an upgraded blaster galven pattern in development. Rangoon posed as an off-world investor to infiltrate BlasTech's weapon research department while the rest of his team were slicing into the security system to cut the department's power. During the confusion, Rangoon was escorted into a conference room where he accessed the facility's computer system and downloaded the needed data into his Vessel implants. BlasTech took care of the emergency and Rangoon completed his tour, and left the facility. The information was then passed on to Cracken."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
