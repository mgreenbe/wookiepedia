At dinner parties where sensitive information was being discussed, Breha Organa sometimes had real Toniray served only to specific guests, such as Grand Moff Tarkin, with the rest served the less-alcoholic duplicate, which was more juice than intoxicant. The two were similar enough in color that only a few could tell the difference."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
