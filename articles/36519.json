During the reign of Emperor Sheev Palpatine, Meeko served in the Imperial Military as a stormtrooper, a shoretrooper with the military rank of sergeant, an Imperial Starfighter Pilot, and subsequently as the chief engineer of a Star Destroyer when holding the rank of Lieutenant Commander.

Inferno Squad was dispatched to Fondor with orders to retrieve satellites that were critical to the execution of Operation: Cinder. After completing their mission, Meeko was ordered to destroy the Emperor's Observatory on Pillio. In the course of his mission, he encountered the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker. Despite their different allegiances, Meeko and Skywalker worked together by fighting off many scritters\u2014indigenous lifeforms that were hostile to the offworlders\u2014in order to reach the observatory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After parting ways with Skywalker, Meeko rejoined Inferno Squad at Vardos where the team learned that Versio's homeworld was one of the targets under Operation: Cinder. Unwilling to participate in the ruin of a planet noted for its loyalty to the Empire, Meeko and Versio rebelled against the military in an effort to save civilians. Having severed their ties with the Empire, they surrendered to the Alliance, but were given a chance to fight alongside the Rebels at the Battle of Theed. By saving Naboo, another planet targeted by Operation: Cinder, Meeko and Versio were both welcomed into the ranks of the newly-formed New Republic by Princess Leia Organa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 5 ABY, approximately one year after the Battle of Endor, the new Inferno Squad was among the Republic forces that defeated the Imperial forces led by Counselor Gallius Rax at the Battle of Jakku.

Decades after the war, Meeko was captured by the First Order and interrogated by Kylo Ren, a dark side warrior tasked with hunting the last Jedi.

Hask however insisted that they remain loyal. After being unable to get Hask to join them, they helped a group of civilians and their crew escape aboard the Corvus, narrowly evading the Eviscerator and Admiral Versio. They decided to surrender to the Rebel Alliance, and provided key intelligence on Operation: Cinder to Danger Leader Shriv Suurgav and General Lando Calrissian.

Afterwards, he was confronted by a living Hask, now an officer in the First Order. In his final words, he addressed Hask by his first name and implored him not to go after Iden, warning Hask it would not end well for him before being shot four times to death by his former squad mate.

Growing up on Coruscant, he heard only frightening stories about the Jedi until being saved by Luke Skywalker, who encouraged him to follow his own path.
