Friction developed between Elinda and Ujaa as the former found his skills as a musician to be mediocre. When Elinda threatened to quit due to Ujaa's lack of talent, Gilthos fired Ujaa and replaced him with another Bith named Loopa, upsetting Ujii who very soon left the band."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Uksaris would later draft a chronicle of the band titled Guts and Glory: A Chronicle of The Amazing Story of The Twisted Rancor Trio which detailed Ujaa's role in the formation of the band and his subsequent dismissal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ujaa, like the other members of the Twisted Rancor Trio, only appear as holograms in the video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic if the player, as Revan finds a package delivered to Gilthos Uksaris in an apartment in the Lower City of Taris.
