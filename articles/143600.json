It was located in Isttu Village. The establishment was built around a central bar and had a number of tables. Three bartenders worked at the bar, while six waitresses were on hand to serve the tables. A secluded alcove was home to a four-piece band that played music ranging from Ithorian classics to chart-topping popular tunes. Nearly everyone who visited the Bazaar went to The Jungle Cantina and it was the hub of news and rumors for the ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
