Jade was supposedly a bounty hunter in the employ of Talon Karrde, and had chased the thief Senni Kiffu in a Skipray Blastboat until both had crashed into the forest. Jade had a swollen, purplish face, thanks to a plant that Mara Jade rubbed on Luke's face, causing him to have an allergic reaction that disguised his true identity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
