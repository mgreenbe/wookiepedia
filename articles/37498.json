The 204th Imperial Fighter Wing provided assistance in the attack after Colonel Shakara Nuress was given orders by one of the Emperor's Messenger droids. The TIE fighter pilots used vortex detonators fired from TIE bombers to stoke the planet's storms, but the Rebel Alliance attempted to defend Nacronis. By the time that Nacronis was covered entirely in one singular storm, the Rebel Alliance had stopped attacking, and the Empire was successful in wiping out the population of the planet. After the storms cleared, one pilot, Yrica Quell, defected from the Empire, and would later be found by the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
