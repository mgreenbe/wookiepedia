While on patrol, he encountered the rebel Princess, Leia Organa at Post 994-203. Organa, disguised as a factory worker, was infiltrating the world in order to spread the seeds of rebellion, hoping that the populace would rise up and fight the Galactic Empire, which controlled the planet with an iron fist. Needing to arm herself, Organa attacked the stormtrooper, using an adhesive spray to clog the ventilation system on his helmet. She then stole his blaster rifle, although at the time she did not realize that the weapon was equipped with a tracking device. The trooper was later recovered by an officer, and Organa was tracked to an ore processing center, thanks to her rigged blaster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The unnamed stormtrooper was created for Star Wars 30, an issue of the Marvel Comics Star Wars run, written by Archie Goodwin.
