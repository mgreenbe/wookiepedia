Heljus used the Force to cause an avalanche, allowing Elsor to escape and return to the base to heal; Master Heljus did not return however. Disoriented form the avalanche and with all communications blocked by the White Maw pirates, Heljus was able to discover the source of the disturbance in the tundra; the Beast-Lord named Brutann from Onderon. Mortally wounded during a confrontation, Heljus was able to transmit a warning to her apprentice before succumbing to her wounds. This information allowed for a Republic spacer to track down and kill the beast lord and end his attacks against the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
