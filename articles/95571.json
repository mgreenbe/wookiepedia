The quest dialogue identified Kerr as male, however the canonical species cannot be definitively determined in the Star Wars Legends continuity. In another quest given by Jan Dodonna, the player was tasked with locating a Rebel pilot named Nateba Kurr. Despite the similar name, there was nothing in the quest dialogue to suggest that they were the same person."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
