Meanwhile, Cade is being tortured by the Sith. He is resistant to Darth Maladi's poison being injected into his system, which impresses Darth Krayt. He asks Cade to turn to the dark side, to which he responds with a huge refusal. He then brings out Jariah Syn and Deliah Blue. He tells Cade that they have been poisoned with a Vong seed, and that only his healing powers can save them, forcing him to tap into the dark power and heal them. He then agrees to let Darth Krayt try to convince him to turn to the dark side if he lets Jariah and Deliah go. Krayt agrees, and they go free. Days later, Krayt calls for a private meeting between him, Cade, and Talon.
