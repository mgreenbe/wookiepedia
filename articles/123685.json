His plan is to use the new Y-Wing bombers to destroy the Separatist flagship's bridge, killing General Grievous and destroying the ship. However, both Plo Koon and Ahsoka think that his plan is too aggressive. Meanwhile, the Malevolence destroys another supply convoy, somewhere in the Outer Rim. After finishing off the final ships, Dooku contacts General Grievous and gives him a new target: the Kaliida Shoals Medical Center."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Admiral Yularen contacts the Kaminoan physician Nala Se on the Medical Center, warning her of a possible attack.

With newly arrived Republic capital ships led by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Admiral Yularen firing on him, Grievous orders the wounded flagship back to Separatist-held space. Anakin and the rest of Shadow Squadron then board the medical station, where they are congratulated by Nala Se.
