The hardware, including three wheeled legs (one retractable), retractable arm, and starship interface jack, was similar to the V1. The standard programming package for V6 units was upgraded from that of V1 units, as it was designed to pilot vessels on longer trips than the V1."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Basic starfighter repair programming supplemented computer and space transport repair skills, the astrogation and piloting software was upgraded from the V1, and the memory could store five sets of hyperspace navigation co-ordinates rather than the V1's three.
