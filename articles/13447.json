Tyber Zann, when hailed by the Rebel fleet, claimed that they wished to join the alliance due to hearing of their victory at Endor. Han Solo then requested his aid in destroying the Eclipse, promising to reward him and his fleet greatly if they succeed. Zann then suggested that they destroy three Cardan V-class space stations guarding the Eclipse if they were to reach it. Han Solo also warned him that if he even suspected that Zann will double-cross them, he wouldn't waste any time taking him out, before wishing him luck. The rebel's initial fleet consisted of 4 MC80 Liberty type Star Cruisers, 2 Mk. II Assault Frigates, 2 Nebulon-B frigates, 3 DP20 frigates, 1 CR90 corvette, the Millennium Falcon, and a large number of fighters. They brought in more ships as reinforcements were needed.

They then focused on destroying the Millennium Falcon. The Millennium Falcon was severely damaged. After a few shots from the Eclipse, the superlaser broke down. This was followed immediately by the arrival of Admiral Gaarn, who commanded the Star Dreadnought Annihilator. At this point, it seemed as though the fight would swing in the Empire's favor. However, the Consortium brought in more reinforcements, and eventually managed to destroy the Annihilator. Shortly afterward, the Consortium team aboard the Eclipse managed to repair the superlaser, used it to mop up the rest of the Imperials and Rebels."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Consortium emerged victorious in the end, but at the cost of many lives and ships on all three sides."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having found information about Palpatine's vaults in the Eclipse's databanks, Zann decided to abandon the vessel, as it was too big a target for the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance to ignore.
