It had a black body with eight arms each tipped with a different melee weapon including blades, a spiked mace, and blasters. A flat, round head contained optical scanners mounted along its perimeter providing a 360-degree view insuring no opponents could easily sneak up on it. Despite this it was destroyed by Grunda Dolma in close combat in the Cauldron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
