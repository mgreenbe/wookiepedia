It stored several crowns traditionally used in the planet's coronation ceremonies, and its records could be accessed using a datapad. Around 40 BBY, while in the treasury, Pijal's court jeweler assisted the Pijali Princess Fanry in selecting a crown for her upcoming coronation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using the treasury's records, the jeweler presented Fanry with wooden boxes containing several crowns for her to choose from. While the princess contemplated, Pijal's Lord Regent, the Jedi Rael Averross, attempted to visit Fanry in the treasury, but he was denied entry due to the sacred nature of the process. Fanry eventually selected one of the treasury's simplest circlets, which the court jeweler brought to the monarch's coronation two days later."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Pijali palace treasury first appeared in Master & Apprentice, a 2019 novel written by Claudia Gray."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
