Designed by R2-D2 and constructed by Finn and Poe Dameron; the obstacle course was designed to help Rey train to be a Jedi so that she could accompany the two Resistance fighters on missions during the First Order/Resistance War. During her first run through the course, Rey and BB-8 fell off the course into a hidden pirate encampment built below ground. After fighting the pirates within the camp, Rey and BB-8 were forced to complete the obstacle course to catch some escaped pirates so that they wouldn't be able to report their whereabouts to the First Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
