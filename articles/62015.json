The former are outnumbered, with droids closing in on them. However, Ahsoka is elsewhere, sending a pack of droids running. Anakin shouts to his Padawan through the comlink that the group she is chasing are regrouping with the main force and orders her to retreat; Ahsoka is in disbelief that her Master is telling her to run and is insistent on continuing; Anakin brings his gunship in front of her and orders her and her troops to get on."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, Anakin and Ahsoka are before the Council for the latter's lack of foresight.

He then places a device in his helper droid, Todo 360, under the pretense of fixing a system crash. Also Bane installs a security chip into Todo, giving him access to all the temple security measures. His partner, Cato Parasitti, a Clawdite bounty hunter, then arrives.

Anakin and Obi-Wan inaccurately deduces that their enemies are after their transmission codes and go to secure their location. Meanwhile, Cato infiltrates the Temple disguised as Ord. However, she is barred by Ahsoka, who asks if \"Ord\" needs help; Cato tries waving her off but the Padawan's pestering results in her snapping at Ahsoka.

Ahsoka then contacts them, having learned from Cato that Bane is after the Vault. However, Bane had completed his objective and sneaked out of the Temple with a holocron, disguising himself with a Jedi robe. However, Cato gives one more clue: Bolla Ropal. Windu realizes that Bane is after the missing Jedi who is the keeper of the Kyber crystal, that with the holocron could crack the data on the crystal, which contains information, listing all the Force-sensitive children in the galaxy; the future of the Jedi Order.
