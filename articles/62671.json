Later, on Liberation Day\u2014the day of a planned treaty between the Galactic Empire and the New Republic\u2014he was shot and rumored to have been killed when a group of freed prisoners from Ashmead's Lock mysteriously and involuntarily shot key New Republic leaders.

This memo described a system run by regional governors and military oppression, with very little power existing with the Imperial Senate. Ij warned that the Senate could no longer be counted on to protect citizens of the Empire from the harsh treatment of Palpatine and his war machine. Ij indicated that if there are any outspoken senators left in the Senate, they will face the same choice Mothma did: flee or be executed."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Military Disarmament Act"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the pivotal Battle of Endor and the death of Emperor Palpatine during the Galactic Civil War, a battle erupted on the planet Naalol. New Republic Chancellor Mon Mothma and her advisers, Hostis Ij and Auxi Kray Korbin, visited a war-torn village on Naalol to provide aid to the wounded and to assess the aftermath of the fighting. In reaction to the seemingly excessive bloodshed of the battle, the Chancellor proposed that the emergency powers that her office had retained since the days of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine be laid down and the power given back to the senate. She also announced the Military Disarmament Act, which planned to reduce the New Republic army by 90 percent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ij opposed both ideas, warning Mothma that a standing army and a strong leader were the only ways to avoid war with the remnants of the Galactic Empire.

Unbeknownst to the Republic's leaders, the peace talks were a ploy orchestrated by Gallius Rax, an Imperial Fleet Admiral. The peace talks were scheduled for a day dubbed \"Liberation Day\" by the senate. Sloane traveled to Chandrila, having been informed that the New Republic capital would be the target of an Imperial attack, planned by Rax. The \"attack\" came not in the form of a bombardment, but rather as a series of assassination attempts as newly-freed prisoners from Ashmead's Lock on Kashyyyk, who were under the influence of controller chips, mysteriously and involuntarily attacked New Republic leaders, injuring Mon Mothma and Kyrsta Agate. Hostis Ij, shot in the head during the attack, was rumored to be among the dead."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several months after Hostis' death, Auxi counselled Chancellor Mothma to find a second adviser. While Hostis and Auxi disagreed professionally, the two were friends who drank, ate, and socialized together. Auxi was deeply affected by Hostis' death. Chancellor Mothma found a worthy successor in the form of the former Imperial loyalty officer Sinjir Rath Velus, who managed to convince five senators to vote in favor of Mothma's bill to send New Republic military forces to Jakku."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hostis Ij and Auxi Kray Korbin often advised Chancellor Mon Mothma differently, each acting like an angel or demon on her shoulder. Sometimes, such as in the debate over the Military Disarmament Act, it was Ij who opposed the Chancellor, while at other times, the roles were reversed. Despite not always agreeing with Mothma, he was loyal to the New Republic and was offended when Kray Korbin sarcastically suggested the Empire would be glad to take him. Even though Kray Korbin and Ij often disagreed in their professional relationship, they were good friends, sharing drinks and spending time with each other's families."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hostis Ij first appeared in one of the many short-story interludes in author Chuck Wendig's 2015 novel, Aftermath."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
