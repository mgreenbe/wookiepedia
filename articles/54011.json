They lived in small underground warrens consisting of ten families. The Gerbs moved by hopping and jumping, and practiced simple farming on the few grasslands of the desert moon.

Gerbs were also immune to Slith bites which were venomous to most other species. Both species also knew nothing or little about offworld affairs and technology since none had left Yavin 13. There were approximately 24 million Gerbs and 19 million Slith, altogether totaling 43 million sentient beings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As part of their efforts to crush the New Jedi Order, the Yuuzhan Vong invaded and conquered the Yavin system.
