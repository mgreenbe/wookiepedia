The passage to the Sensor Station was littered with mines and Tractor Towers. The group was also stymied by the arrival of bombers, Vulture droid starfighters and Trade Federation U-boats."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the group negotiated their way around the various islands and traps they came to the Sensor Station itself and were greeted by a warning from Harro Ruuk, The Trade Federation regional commander of the Karthakk system. Sol Sixxa then infiltrated the base and set explosive charges that destroyed the Station once and for all. Ruuk then surfaced in a crab submarine and engaged Nym, who promptly destroyed the submarine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nym and the group would then depart for coordinates that led to Mount Merakan to investigate the Federation's interest in the area. Ruuk would escape via escape pod and dock with a local Lucrehulk-class battleship where he would be killed by a vile of trihexalon after Captain Cavik Toth became most displeased with his apparent lack of progress."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This article was created based on a mission in the video game Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter.
