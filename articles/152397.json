The supply ship crashed on the planet Agamar in the Outer Rim Territories during a battle between Republic and Separatist forces. Following the war's conclusion and the deactivation of the Separatist Droid Army in 19 BBY, the vessel was left derelict on the planet's surface, and was used to house the super tactical droid General Kalani and his garrison of battle droids, which remained there until 2 BBY during the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Armed with no weapons, this DH-Omni Support Vessel was equipped with an external loudspeaker and an internal ray shield generator.

However, the supply ship, carrying Kalani and his forces, was engaged by Republic forces and crashed on the planet's surface during the battle, and remained abandoned as the Clone Wars moved toward its conclusion in 19 BBY. While on Agamar, Kalani later received the order to deactivate himself and his droid forces, but assumed it to be a Republic trick and refused to follow his orders. As a result, for seventeen years, Kalani and his garrison of battle droids waited for the chance to end the Clone Wars in favor of the Separatist Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later during the Galactic Civil War in 2 BBY, the supply ship was visited by several rebel operatives of Phoenix Cell who traveled to the planet in search of proton bombs for their fight against the Galactic Empire, but were instead forced by Kalani to take part in his battle otherwise they would be terminated. During the battle, however, the Empire, alerted by a distress signal sent out by the astromech droid C1-10P, dispatched an Imperial I-class Star Destroyer and two Gozanti-class cruisers carrying All Terrain Defense Pods and All Terrain Armored Transports to the Agamar system to destroy the rebels, which resulted in both the garrison and rebels joining forces to fight off the Imperial forces and make their escape from the planet in three Sheathipede-class transport shuttles, one of which was kept by the rebels as their replacement for the destroyed Phantom and another which was destroyed amid the escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This DH-Omni Support Vessel first appeared in \"The Last Battle,\" the sixth episode of the animated television series Star Wars Rebels' third season, which aired on October 22, 2016."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
