Studied by native xenobiologists, the dragons were revealed to be semi-sentient and thus protected from hunting by Galactic Republic law. Covered in hardened scales which protected their bodies from most conventional weapons of sentients such as vibroblades; the dragons possessed the ability to spew fire from their mouths as a defense mechanism. The dragon could fly up to 3,000 meters at speeds of 140 kilometers per hour; their propensity for lightning-fast strikes led to the famed Jedi Master Arca Jeth to craft a lightsaber training technique which was modeled on the dragon's ability. Instructing such famed Jedi as Ulic and Cay Qel-Droma and Tott Doneeta in the technique, Jeth's teachings lived on within the Jedi Order long after his death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the dragons of Arkania declined in numbers and were largely considered extinct as of 4000 BBY.
