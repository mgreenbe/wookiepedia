On Balmorra, the Hero and Jedi Master Warren Sedoru worked with the Republic Military and the Balmorran resistance to recover a copy of the prototype cloaking device that shielded the Emperor's Fortress. After rescuing Master Braga's Padawan and former Dark Councilor Sajar from the Emperor's Wrath Lord Scourge on the planet Quesh, the Hero traveled to Hoth and searched for the schematics for the space station with the help of Leeha Narezz and Sergeant Fideltin Rusk of the 301st Infantry. The campaign would ultimately end in disaster when the strike team was defeated and turned to the dark side by the Emperor aboard his fortress."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
