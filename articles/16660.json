In 4 ABY, Emperor Palpatine was killed by the Rebel Alliance during the Battle of Endor. The Empire fell to pieces, with swaths of Imperials turning warlord and establishing their own dominions in various parts of the galaxy. Meanwhile on Imperial Center, Palpatine's successors advocated the continuation of the war with the Rebels, who had reformed into the New Republic. Despite the fragmentation, Oxtroe and her forces remained loyal to the Empire proper under the command of Sate Pestage, alongside other officers such as Uther Kermen and Gilad Pellaeon, and she was responsible for the defense of several fortress worlds in the Core and Colonies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Admiral Oxtroe was one of the few Imperial proponents for a peace process with the New Republic, espousing a parliamentary monarchy that would unite both sides of the conflict. In 7 ABY, Oxtroe made secret entreaties to the New Republic, hoping to open talks of establishing such a system. Palpatine had a distant grand-niece, Ederlathh Pallopides, who Oxtroe proposed as a possible heir to the late Emperor. Pallopides was just eleven years old, so she would act as a mere figurehead; the New Republic Provisional Council would have control, playing a similar role to the Imperial Advisors under Palpatine. In return for what Oxtroe saw as Imperial concessions, the Provisional Council would give amnesty to the Imperial Military. The New Republic was open to negotiations, and talks began in earnest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many Imperials did not want peace accords. The reborn Emperor Palpatine was preparing an Imperial reunification, while Grand Admiral Thrawn was hiding in the Unknown Regions, waiting for the right time to strike at the New Republic. Thrawn commanded a species of fierce warriors known as the Noghri; a Noghri assassin killed Oxtroe before the first round of talks had concluded, and the idea was not pursued. New Republic historian Voren Na'al suspected Thrawn's hand in the Admiral's death, but had no evidence. Ultimately, the Empire and New Republic continued to wage war for over a decade, until Gilad Pellaeon and Ponc Gavrisom signed accords in 19 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Betl Oxtroe was one of a few women to achieve a high rank in the Empire.
