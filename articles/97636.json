A known screenshot of Lip'to exists, depicting him as a randomly generated Human male under the \"dressed_commoner_naboo_human_male_06.iff\" Interchange File Format. However, because the game files do not include the exact template used for Lip'to, it cannot be concluded that he always spawned as a Human. Furthermore, it should noted that the known screenshot of Lip'to was taken from one of two defunct Japanese servers, which used different character templates for some of its NPCs. In any case, while the canonical species of Lip'to cannot be definitively determined in the Star Wars Legends continuity, the quest dialogue identified Lip'to as male. The questline that involved Lip'to was removed from the game sometime after launch."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
