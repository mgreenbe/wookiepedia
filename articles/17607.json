As a result, \"Blackmoon\" was the New Republic codeword for the planet. It was so-called because it had a black surface, covered in canyons and volcanic craters, and circled Borleias in a 32-hour orbit. It also had a thin atmosphere. In the First Battle of Borleias of the Yuuzhan Vong War, Maal Lah installed dovin basals on Blackmoon, using a variation of the Yo'gand's Core tactic to sweep up Borleias' space defense platforms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
