In 32 BBY, a dispute between the Galactic Republic and the Trade Federation over the taxation of trade routes to outlying systems led the Federation to impose a blockade on the Mid Rim world of Naboo. The Federation was eventually expelled by a coalition of Naboo humans, Gungans, and Jedi. Senator Sheev Palpatine of Naboo took advantage of the occupation of his homeworld in order to succeed Finis Valorum as Supreme Chancellor.

The discovery of the clone army on Kamino and a Separatist Droid Army on Geonosis set the stage for the First Battle of Geonosis, which became the catalyst of the Clone Wars.

The Confederacy of Independent Systems collapsed with the deaths of Dooku, General Grievous, and the Separatist Council on Mustafar. Palpatine then took the opportunity to destroy the Jedi Order and to transform the Republic into the first Galactic Empire. Emperor Palpatine also took on Anakin Skywalker as his new Sith apprentice Darth Vader. With Order 66 marking the end of the Jedi Order, the Jedi, who once numbered thousands, practically disappeared. However, some managed to survive and the flames of the Jedi continued to burn in the galaxy, although with much less force than before. Pursued by the imperial forces, some surviving Jedi chose to hide instead of fighting the new government that increasingly spread its dominance among the stars of the galaxy. Planets considered unimportant and unpleasant, like Tatooine, a desert world with great criminal influence, Dagobah, a wild and swampy world, and Bracca, a scrap world where the Scrapper Guild worked, were used as hiding places by the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Age of the Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fascist Galactic Empire became the dominant government of the galaxy for the next two and a half decades.

In secret, the Empire embarked on an ambitious program to create a planet-destroying superweapon called the Death Star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Empire also expropriated land and resources and ruthlessly stamped out dissent. HoloNet and other media became a propaganda medium for the Empire. In addition, the Empire was xenophobic and favored humans at the expense of alien species. In the Imperial order, aliens were regarded as serfs, slaves, and obstacles needing to be tamed, removed, or ignored. Humans came to dominate the Imperial government and military while alien species such as the Wookiees and Talz were enslaved. Other alien species such as the Lasat and Geonosians also experienced genocide.

Most of these movements were strictly local, determined to free an individual planet or star system from Imperial rule. Eventually, however, dissatisfaction and opposition to the Empire culminated in a scattered network of rebel cells. Around 4 BBY, rebel cells began to coalesce into larger groups such as the Phoenix Cell, ending a previous policy of maintaining secrecy and beginning the Galactic Civil War. As the rebellion grew in power, some Imperial tacticians such as Thrawn realized that the Empire was facing a galaxy-wide insurgency. By 2 BBY, these disparate rebel groups had formed the Alliance to Restore the Republic under Mon Mothma and Bail Organa.

In response, the Rebel Alliance used the stolen Death Star plans to destroy the Death Star during the Battle of Yavin. For the next four years, the galaxy was locked in a civil war between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. Fighting took place at locations like the Mid Rim, Sullust, Hoth, and Cloud City. In response, the Emperor commissioned the construction of a second Death Star above Endor and laid a trap for the Rebel Alliance in a calculated gamble. However, Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker managed to redeem his father Darth Vader, who sacrificed himself to save his son by killing the Emperor, which restored balance to the Force.

However, the chaos caused by the civil war and the death of the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure allowed various criminal factions including the pirate lord Eleodie Maracavanya and the Red Key Raiders to gain traction.
