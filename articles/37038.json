He was stationed as a range trooper with the rank of captain on the planet Vandor, where he and his squad were assigned as security and surveillance for the 20-T Railcrawler conveyex transport lines.

The hauler dropped Beckett and two of his accomplices on top of the train, where they made their way along to the car containing the coaxium. Once they had confirmed its location, the hauler returned so they could attach it to the car; however, Banevans and his men emerged onto the roof of the rearmost train car and opened fire on Beckett's gang, preventing the attachments being made."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle on the train"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Beckett returned fire while his accomplices, Han Solo and Chewbacca, began climbing down the car they were on to detach it from the rearward cars. The gang leader managed to kill the range trooper who had progressed furthest toward him while the rest kept progressing along the top and side of the train, using their magnetic gription boots to prevent themselves from falling. Beckett then managed to hit another trooper's boot, causing it to malfunction and preventing him from moving any further.

The cars carrying the troopers were disconnected from the front half of the train and slowly ground to a halt, leaving the range troopers unable to confront the criminal gang.
