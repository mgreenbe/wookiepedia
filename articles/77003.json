She rationalizes her actions to the duo by informing them that because of the massacre, Lhosan Industries (a major employer in the Lower City) has decided to relocate to a safer planet. At this time, Gryph spots the man he came to see, Camper, and asks for his assistance in smuggling them off the planet. Camper refuses to help the fugitives escape, however, and ignores Gryph's pleas for help."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At that moment, Taris Civil Authorities and the Jedi pursuing Zayne and Gryph swoop in on a gunship and order them to surrender. Camper and Jarael rush to get out of the area quickly, not caring that Gryph and Zayne follow them. Revealing the junk shop to be a junk hauler, the four escape the planet. The escape is short-lived, however, as the ill-equipped hauler loses power just as an orbital patrol ship approaches."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
