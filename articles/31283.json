Operated by Bina, an Amani from Utapau, it was used as her home base in Black Spire Outpost for collecting exotic creatures. She often left the shop in the care of her assistants while she traveled off-world. It featured a number of caged animals for purchase, including Kowakian monkey-lizards, porgs, fyrnocks, convorees, loth-cats, and worrts.
