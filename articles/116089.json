Loo betrayed the Galactic Republic and the council by conspiring with Separatist leader Count Dooku, using his knowledge of mystical powers to influence Boss Lyonie's mind and prompt him to propose a Gungan army attack on the Naboo capital of Theed alongside Separatist forces. When Anakin Skywalker and Padm\u00e9 Amidala discovered the plot and removed the control necklace off Lyonie, the latter confronted Loo, who stabbed the Boss. Loo then fled to the surface to meet with the Gungan army, where he claimed that the Naboo murdered Lyonie to spur them to commend the attack. However, his plan was thwarted by Jar Jar Binks, who posed as Lyonie, due to the uncanny resemblance between the two and the fact that Lyonie was unconscious at the time, and revealed Loo's treachery. Loo fled with Skywalker in pursuit. Loo led Skywalker all the way to Dooku's hideout, where Count Dooku ignited his lightsaber through Loo for his incompetence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
