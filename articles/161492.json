The gang was led by Vladlun Travan, a criminal involved in the kidnapping and murder of Felicia, the daughter of Wernell Covington, years before the Battle of Yavin. Circa 1 ABY, the Narmle Militia was able to provide the last known location of Travan to Wernell Covington and the latter dispatched a spacer to Vladlun Travan's Hideout. The spacer fought and eliminated several gangsters during the attack. Covington's henchman eventually killed Vladlun Travan in the depths of the bunker, avenging the murder of Felicia Covington. Around the same time, the bounty hunter Boba Fett also visited Vladlun Travan's Hideout to collect bounties for three criminals known to be associates of Travan: Titus Dabrini, Aztin Maru and Tiaba Charr. However, Fett decided to let a spacer do his dirty work and take out the bounty targets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vladlun's gang appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
