Most of its available space was dedicated to cargo storage, and some of the space was not oxygenated or temperature controlled and therefore unfit for human habitation. The minority of the ship that was not dedicated to cargo contained operational hubs, living spaces, a mess hall, and a medbay. After the Battle of Endor, it was used by Caern Adan's working group to research Shadow Wing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
