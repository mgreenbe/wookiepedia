Thousands of clone troopers raided the Temple and slaughtered all of the Jedi within. The Arena was left in ruins, and fell into disuse. The Temple sat in the hands of the Galactic Empire throughout the Galactic Civil War, virtually empty excluding the small occupying force of stormtroopers. It was not until the New Republic drove the Empire off Coruscant that the Temple was reclaimed by the reformed Jedi Order. Leading the small group of Jedi, Luke Skywalker briefly occupied the Temple and routed the Empire's agents still stationed there. While making use of the facility for several years, it was eventually abandoned again during the Yuuzhan Vong War when it was reduced to rubble."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Galactic Alliance reclaimed Coruscant, Chief of State Cal Omas ordered the restoration of the Temple on behalf of the valiant Order and their sacrifices during the war.
