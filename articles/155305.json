In the years before Battle of Yavin, the Ugnaught, along with his Lothal astromech droid, were stopped by two stormtroopers. The troopers told the salesman that he could not sell the fruits in the alley he was in. The troopers were about to arrest the Ugnaught after he attempted to bribe them, but the Ugnaught was saved when the Lasat rebel Garazeb Orrelios subdued the troopers. The Ugnaught offered Orrelios the same credits he was attempting to bribe the Imperials with, but Orrelios declined and took a jogan fruit instead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
