By around 9 ABY, he had acquired the legendary Mandalorian weapon known as the Darksaber and risen to the position of moff, leading a remnant of the fallen Empire. While leading his Imperial remnant, Gideon sought out a high-value asset known as Grogu, a Force-sensitive youngling necessary as a blood donor for his experiments. After Din Djarin, a Mandalorian bounty hunter, went rogue and rescued Grogu from a detachment of Gideon's forces on Nevarro, the moff took an active role in acquiring the child. He was eventually successful, when his dark troopers captured Grogu on Tython. Upon Djarin's effort to rescue Grogu, he was defeated in combat and detained, as ownership of the Darksaber passed to Djarin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial service"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gideon was an officer in the Imperial Security Bureau of the Galactic Empire.

In the aftermath of the fall of Mandalore, Gideon came into possession of the Darksaber, the legendary weapon and significant symbol of House Vizsla that had previously been used by Lady Bo-Katan Kryze as leader of the Mandalorians.

He wished to acquire a valuable asset from Arvala-7, tasking \"the Client\" and Doctor Pershing with bringing it alive by any means necessary. This asset was a Force-sensitive infant, Grogu, and Gideon used the remains of the Imperial Army in an attempt to acquire it."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Arrival on Nevarro"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon contacting the Client on Nevarro, he informed Gideon that they had Grogu in their custody. Gideon, however, told him to recheck Grogu's pram. Soon after, Gideon's squad of death troopers opened fire on the Client and the stormtroopers accompanying him in the cantina. Moments later, a K79-S80 Imperial Troop Transport arrived, deploying stormtroopers to supplement the death troopers and secure the area outside the cantina. Shortly after, Gideon landed his Outland TIE fighter, behind the mass of troopers. As he climbed out from his ship and approached the broken cantina window, he confronted the mercenaries inside, the Mandalorian Din Djarin, Greef Karga, and ex-rebel Cara Dune. He told them that they did not understand Grogu at all and described how much he needed it. As he said this, two of Gideon's scout troopers intercepted and killed the Ugnaught Kuiil, who was taking Grogu back to Djarin's ship, the Razor Crest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the two scout troopers were retrieving Grogu, Gideon killed an officer for interrupting him. The scout troopers attempted to bring Grogu to him, but were stopped by the droid IG-11. Gideon's set up an E-Web heavy repeating blaster cannon. Upon hearing Djarin and his crew desperately trying to escape through the vents, Gideon began to speak to the group. Gideon introduced his E-Web turret and described how it had mowed down many of Dune's ranks as well as many Mandalorian recruits at the Night of a Thousand Tears during the Siege of Mandalore. Gideon revealed both their full names in the process\u2014Carasynthia Dune and Din Djarin. Lastly, he called out Karga as a disgraced magistrate and telling him to lay down his weapon and to come outside."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gideon finished off by saying that the E-Web would soon destroy the cantina. After hearing this, Karga called out to Gideon to ask the moff what he was proposing. Gideon answered by offering reasonable negotiation. Karga further asked what assurance he offered, who told Karga that they couldn't trust him. Gideon continued by remarking how Karga broke their earlier arrangement and stated how he would gladly break any promise he made to them, and would happily watch the former magistrate die, and that all that Gideon could offer was that he would act in his self-interest. After he had finished, Gideon left his troopers to watch over the cantina. He turned around to tell Djarin and his crew that they had until nightfall to cooperate. Otherwise, he would order the E-Web to open fire."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "A failed rescue"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Gideon walked off, IG-11 began a rescue effort, giving Djarin, Karga, and Dune a chance to escape. A battle ensued, and amongst all of the chaos, Gideon watched the battle around him. He eyed Djarin while the Mandalorian utilized the E-Web. Before long, Gideon raised his blaster and shot Djarin in the back of the head. Before Mandalorian could fire back, Gideon took his time to adjust his aim and fire at the E-Web's power pack. It exploded, sending Djarin flying backward. His injuries forced him and the others to fall back into the cantina. Dune dragged Djarin into the cantina while Karga and IG-11 retreated inside. Frustrated with the lack of progress, Gideon ordered an incinerator trooper to burn them out. The trooper set the building alight but was overpowered and killed when Grogu used the Force to push back the flames."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Djarin and his team escaped through the sewer vents, Gideon sent in more stormtroopers to stop them. When their efforts had failed, Gideon dispatched another platoon to wait at the end of a lava river. Upon anticipating his troops' failure, Gideon hopped into his TIE/ln space superiority starfighter to deal with Djarin himself. After IG-11 detonated, killing off the entire platoon, Gideon swooped in and began to fire at the Mandalorian and his team. He swerved his TIE back around and met Djarin. The Mandalorian flew up into the air on his new jetpack and grappled onto the back of his TIE fighter. Gideon tried his best to shake him off but was unsuccessful. After climbing on top of the TIE fighter, Djarin tried to shoot him from the roof of the cockpit, but was protected by the blast-proof glass, allowing him to continue shaking off the Mandalorian."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gideon spun his TIE fighter and darted in multiple directions to lose Djarin, but the latter managed to plant detonators on the TIE. By the time Gideon discovered them, the left-wing blew off, and a fire started inside of the cockpit. After he crashed, the Mandalorian and the rest of his crew assumed he was dead. Djarin parted ways with his comrades and flew off-world with Grogu. Sometime later, a group of Jawas attempted to salvage the wreckage of Gideon's TIE fighter. Gideon, alive and still sitting in the rubble, carved his way out of the TIE using the Darksaber. The Jawa scavengers had been scared off before Gideon stepped out and climbed on top of the TIE fighter, scanning his surroundings."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Further disruptions"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the estuary moon of Trask, Kryze arranged a heist for weapons on an Imperial Gozanti-class cruiser leaving Trask. Kryze worked with Djarin to infiltrate the ship and was also helped by two other Mandalorians, Axe Woves and Koska Reeves. As they were successful for taking the ship, a captain contacted Gideon in need of reinforcements. Gideon asked the captain how far the Mandalorians had breached. When the captain told him they had taken most of the ship, Gideon stated that it was too late to send reinforcements and cryptically told them they knew what to do. Only the captain was aware of his meaning, upon which he shut off the hologram and killed both pilots, pushing the ship straight into the waters of Trask. He was unsuccessful however, and was stopped by Djarin and was then interrogated by Kryze for the Darksaber, but the officer followed Gideon's orders to the very end and committed suicide by setting off an electric shock mechanism in his mouth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around the same time, Gideon had received a hologram message from Dr. Pershing, who was apologizing to him for failing an experiment involving Grogu and Strand-Casts.

As the four of them went on this mission, a Mimbanese worker started working on Djarin's ship, who Djarin unknowingly was installing a tracking device on his ship. Djarin and the others viewed the hologram of Pershing and realized that the Imperials were performing experiments. Gideon was later contacted and was told that the Razor Crest had the device installed. Gideon smiled to himself and continued to supervise the work of his scientists on his dark troopers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gideon's forces tracked Djarin's ship to Tython. From high atmosphere, two Imperial transports carrying stormtroopers launched from Gideon's light cruiser, to combat Djarin and his allies, Boba Fett and Fennec Shand. After the stormtroopers' defeat, Gideon's cruiser fired on Djarin's ship, the Razor Crest, and destroyed it. Afterwards, four dark troopers were launched from the cruiser and landed near the seeing stone where Grogu had been meditating. There, one of the dark troopers seized Grogu and flew upwards back to the cruiser with the other three dark troopers while Fett pursued them from his ship. Upon seeing the cruiser, Fett remarked in disbelief that the Empire was back. Once the trooper droids returned to the cruiser with the captured child, Gideon's cruiser jumped to hyperspace. While still in hyperspace, Gideon briefly talked to the child in his prison cell, walking in on the child attacking two stormtroopers. Gideon showed Grogu the Darksaber before having his stormtroopers stun him and place him in shackles to prevent him from using his powers on them. Gideon then ordered his comms officer to send an encrypted message to Doctor Pershing informing him that they had their donor for his experiments once they exited hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Din Djarin and his crew infiltrated Gideon's cruiser, and they split, Bo-Katan searching for Gideon, and Djarin searching for the child. Gideon was prepared, and tried to trick the Mandalorian to lower his guard with promises of returning the Child, claiming to no longer need him, having already taken his blood. He attempted to strike at Djarin from behind, and proceeded to battle the Mandalorian, who fought back with his beskar spear, while telling him about the Darksaber. Despite his best efforts, Djarin ultimately defeated Gideon in battle and took both him and the Darksaber to the bridge. When Djarin attempted to give the Darksaber to Bo-Katan, she refused and Gideon laughed, telling Djarin that she had to best him in combat to rightfully claim it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Then the dark troopers, which Djarin had ejected into space, returned via their rocket boosters. Confident that everyone besides himself and Grogu would be killed by the dark troopers, he did not anticipate the arrival of Luke Skywalker. Gideon was horrified when the Jedi began cutting down his dark troopers, upon which he realized that he was truly defeated. Despite having his hands bound, Gideon managed to get a blaster from his distracted captors and attempted to shoot Bo-Katan and Grogu, but failed.

Strongly affected by Peter Cushing's performance as Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin as well, Esposito tried to do some research for the role. From Esposito's point of view, he does believe that Gideon genuinely wants to bring order and security to ultimately allow the universe to survive and thinks of him as the galaxy's \"top warden,\" who oversees that people don't overrun or take out each other."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gideon's costume was designed by Brian Matyas, designer of various characters in the series.
