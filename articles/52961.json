He saw evidence of the Thaereians transporting their prisoners to die in the arena abaord the Burnout space station and knew that the Thaereian military commanders were feeding their troops misinformation, so he considered deserting, but his loyalty to Derlynn made him stay. During the Clone Wars, he and the rest of the squad were sent to occupy an abandoned Cularin Militia base in the Cularin system asteroid belt. The Heroes of Cularin arrived there, intending to deliver supplies to the Militia, so the squad tried to make them surrender to them. However, the heroes tried to convince Nawling and his comrades to defect to the Militia instead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
