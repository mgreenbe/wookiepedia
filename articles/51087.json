Non-Jedi attendees included Queen Amidala, Boss Rugor Nass, newly-elected Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, Anakin Skywalker, and Jar Jar Binks, among several others. The events of the funeral nearly caused Queen Amidala to cancel the victory celebrations that had been planned for the following day out of respect for the late Jedi Master, but she reconsidered after Kenobi informed her that Jinn would have wanted her to continue with the celebration."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The death of Qui-Gon left Anakin feeling depressed. The separation from his mother and the realization that Padm\u00e9 was the Queen of Naboo left him feeling insecure about his future direction. Obi-Wan promised Anakin that he would become a Jedi. Likewise, during the funeral, Windu and Yoda acknowledged that the Sith had indeed returned and began to speculate that there was likely another Sith Lord in adherence with the Rule of Two, though they were unsure as to whether the Sith who had killed Qui-Gon had been the master or the apprentice. Unknown to the two Jedi Masters at the time, however, the Sith Master, Darth Sidious, was present at the funeral under the public persona of Palpatine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
