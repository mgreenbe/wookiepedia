Brockway led in the place of General Tyben, who remained with the Republic's Chancellor Mon Mothma on the planet Chandrila during the battle so that the New Republic would not be left without military leaders if they lost at Jakku. Tyben, who remained on Chandrila, was kept up to date on the progress of Brockway's forces during the battle, and discussed them with Fleet Admiral Gial Ackbar via hologram, while Brockway led the strategy on the ground. The New Republic claimed victory but only after many sustaining casualties, with fighting continuing against Imperial forces who refused to surrender for many months on Jakku."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Brockway was first mentioned in the novel Aftermath: Empire's End, which was written by Chuck Wendig and released on February 21, 2017."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
