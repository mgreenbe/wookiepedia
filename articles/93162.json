His filmography includes The Hellfire Club featuring Peter Cushing, crime drama The Frightened City starring a young Sean Connery (both 1961), Scars of Dracula (1970), alongside Christopher Lee and The Creeping Flesh (1973), alongside both Cushing and Lee. Bush also appeared in the bizarre musical comedy Son of Dracula (a.k.a. Count Downe) in 1974, directed by Freddie Francis, and starring legendary musician Harry Nilsson. This strange movie also features Ringo Starr as Merlin the magician. Bush's small role as the mute and child-like Frankenstein Monster is both charming and memorable. He also appeared in many popular British television series, including Dixon of Dock Green, Doctor Who (cast as an Ogron, an alien enemy of the Doctor) and Inspector Morse."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bush was selected to play mummy-like bounty hunter Dengar in Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back (1980), uncredited and without any speaking lines."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dengar was intended to appear again in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi (1983), as one of the background characters on Jabba the Hutt's sail barge, and his footage was filmed.
