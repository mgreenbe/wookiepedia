It coincided with an eclipse of the sun caused by the planets in the star system, and it involved members of the A'Mar standing vigil over the wellspring during the night and drinking from its waters. The Vigil could only be carried out by A'Mar that had never before drunk from the Wellspring."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Vigil originated with the first settlers on the moon, who camped near the Wellspring. During the night of the eclipse, the settlers were extremely afraid. With the advent of morning, they realized the nature of the eclipse; however, they maintained the tradition throughout their time on the moon. It became important for how they viewed civilization, and the initial affection for the site turned into a spiritual connection with the Wellspring."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
