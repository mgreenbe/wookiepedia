As a result, 1 million metric tons of cargo and two years' worth of consumables could be stored on such a station. The typical crew was 250 (minimum crew of 40), not including their assigned Imperial DepotSec troops, varying in number from 12 to 100 depending on strategic importance. Each station was shielded and defended by at least four TIE/LN starfighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bid to produce the Baas-class space station was won by Durastar Construction, a company that was based on the planet Malastare. After the Empire gave its approval to the space station blueprints, Durastar demonstrated that the stations could be produced quickly and efficiently, by constructing a prototype in just 25 days. The Empire was pleased by these results and ordered dozens more Baas-class stations, giving Durastar the capital that it needed to expand its facilities, so that it could complete the order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
