It was a simple, yet extremely versatile and adaptable model of ASP-series droid used for gathering, harvesting, drilling, hunting, building, and generalized labor. The base model was capable of only the most menial tasks, but the ASP-7 was designed for easy upgrades. Their programming could be easily adapted, and their physical structure contained many unused upgrade-ports where new hardware or tools could be fitted. They seemed to use a speech module different from the standard ASP variant of CBell-1, as their \"droidspeak\" consisted of a variety of sounds.\nThey were known for being the best seller model of the ASP-series droid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "ASP-7's first and only appearance in the Trilogy came in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope Special Edition.

The figure's bubble had a sticker placed on the bottom stating that the droid was from newly created footage seen in the Special Edition. The loose figure had very limited articulation, molded in a silver color with slight black paint spray detail.
