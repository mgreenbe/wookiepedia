The basic two-dimensional camera was in use since at least the Jedi Civil War and for millennia after, a testament to its reliability. Other types of security scanners included motion sensors, infrared sensors, weapon detectors, and holographic recorders. These devices were usually small and unobtrusive, capable of being installed virtually anywhere. Some of the more sophisticated holocams could record video and audio data. Other scanners included precision scanners designed to rapidly turn, track, and zoom in on a target; ultraviolet and infrared security scanners for low-light environments; and long-range exterior scanners. Some scanners, albeit with a limited range, could be concealed in other devices such as comlinks and datapads. Some of the smallest scanners, with only audio-recording capabilities, could record conversations and movement in a certain area."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This type of equipment was used by the Imperial scanning crew that inspected the Millennium Falcon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
