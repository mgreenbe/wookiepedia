The Recusant served as the general's command ship and was used against the Venator-class Star Destroyer, Steadfast, during the capture of Jedi Master Eeth Koth. Grievous and his troops boarded the enemy craft and successfully captured Koth. Sometime after, the destroyer was used with the rest of Grievous's fleet over the planet Saleucami, and would engage a Republic fleet over the planet. During this battle the ship was destroyed, but Grievous escaped to the planet below."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
