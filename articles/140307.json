A notable deployment of the cruisers was when the Taris Civil Authority and the Jedi Covenant issued an arrest warrant for Jedi Padawan Zayne Carrick and the Snivvian Marn \"Gryph\" Hierogryph for their alleged involvement in the Padawan Massacre of Taris. In an effort to escape offworld from the Civil Authority, Hierogryph decided to call on the Arkanian Offshoot mechanic Gorman \"Camper\" Vandrayk and his companion Jarael for help. An arrest squad led by Sector Constable Noana Sowrs and Jedi Master Lucien Draay arrived soon after the fugitives found Vandrayk and Jarael. Vandrayk ultimately decided to take them inside his modified starship, The Last Resort, and attempt to leave the planet. The Taris Civil Authority were not expecting the fugitives to flee to space and did not have craft capable of following. Sowrs assured Draay, both aboard a Civil Authority gunship, that the police cruisers would be able to apprehend The Last Resort."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unreliable repairs made to The Last Resort caused it to stop in orbit of the planet, where three of the police cruisers surrounded the ship. Sector Constable Sowrs authorized these cruisers to use lethal force if necessary. Vandrayk managed to fix his ship's systems and it suddenly sped off into the Tarisian asteroid belt, hitting one of the police cruisers in the process. After deciding to look for T1-LB, an LB-series bulk-loading droid that was used by the masters of the Jedi Tower to set up portable shields for them to meditate under safely, Carrick and Jarael were dropped off where the droid was last seen\u2014Taris' Rogue moon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The duo found the droid at the foot of a cliff, having been pushed off with the Force by Draay. They then suddenly found themselves confronted with said Master, who had navigated through the asteroid belt in a police cruiser with several Civil Authority officers to find them. However, the empty police cruiser was shot down by Hierogryph in The Last Resort, as the Snivvian had discovered that Vandrayk had rerouted the power from the hyperdrive to \"one beauty of a gun.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Siege of Taris, a cruiser was located in the Lower City base of the Taris Resistance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Taris Civil Authority police cruiser was first mentioned in Knights of the Old Republic 3 and first appeared in the issue after, Knights of the Old Republic 4.
