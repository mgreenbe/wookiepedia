Employed by the megacorporations which had set up shop on the planet following its occupation, the Fleetwing was unpopular due to its bumpy ride and the fact that it was an open-air craft, requiring passengers to wear environmental suits when riding in one. In appearance it strongly resembled the 9000 Z004 landspeeder, a fact which caused Ubrikkian Industries to sue Ikas-Adno for theft of the design."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
