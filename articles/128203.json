The craft was a heavily modified VR-10 Cuirilla-Rayl Xylines-class space tug and was used for short range runs through Hutt Space. Although the craft was not designed for having weapons or a hyperdrive, Rooty was able to install a short-range hyperdrive along with two laser turrets and a tractor beam. Although the smuggler used the ship sparingly, it fell into disrepair under Rooty's possession and began to slowly fall apart."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
