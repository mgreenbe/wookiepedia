Circa 21 BBY, M-1991 was captured by the Galactic Republic and imprisoned alongside other wanted bounty hunters aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tempestuous for transporting to Coruscant, the Republic capital. During the voyage, the prisoner Arlain Zee escaped from his cell and freed M-1991 and several other bounty hunters. While a large group of bounty hunters attacked their clone trooper guards, Zee, M-1991, the Gand Esu, the Iktotchi Volan Das and the Trandoshan Kessk attempted to make their way to the hangar bay in order to steal a starship and flee. However, M-1991 was soon recaptured by the clones, and on arrival to the destination-world of Coruscant, they was escorted off the Tempestuous along with Esu and Kessk by two clone troopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
