As a member of the planet's ruling Neshtovar, Vaal was one of the few Keshiri adept at riding Kesh's native flying uvak beasts. Vaal was married to a woman named Adari\u2014the match came about after years of lobbying by Adari's ambitious mother, Eulyn. The Vaals were together for nine years, a relatively unhappy union that produced two children, Tona and Finn. Although Zhari's profession revolved around the uvak creatures he rode as a member of the Neshtovar, Vaal was abusive toward his mount, Nink. After mistreating Nink one day, the beast flew Vaal far out over an ocean and dropped him. Vaal was killed but remembered fondly at his wake, eulogized by Neshtovar member Izri Dazh as \"the valiant young rider of the Neshtovar on whom so many hopes rested.\" While his widow, Adari, went on to absorb herself in her work as a geologist, Vaal's children were taken care of by his mother-in-law, Eulyn. After Adari's death in exile in the far-off continent of Alanciar, decades after Vaal's demise, Adari's personal memoirs were found, although they contained little about Vaal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zhari Vaal was not a bright individual and lacked conversational ability.
