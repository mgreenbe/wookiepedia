At that time, the Nikto stood watching a Bith sitting near him. Soon after, however, the Nikto became bored, and drifted away toward a Quarren. By that time, Ahsoka had begun the Force to listen in on people's conversations in the hopes of picking up on the whereabouts of a dangerous bounty hunter. The first conversation she heard was between this Nikto and the Quarren he had recently encountered. The Quarren owned a business, and due to the war, it was doing poorly. All this was told to an extremely distracted Nikto, who turned slightly to let out a subtle grunt before the Quarren had finished his sentence. When a fight broke out between the Jedi and the patrons of the cantina, the Nikto, along with the other patrons, soon became distracted from credits thrown by one of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
