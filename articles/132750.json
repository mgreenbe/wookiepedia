There, they find Don-Wan Kihotay, who recounts his adventure with the Star-Hoppers of Aduba-3. The gang mistakes the Star-Hoppers for the group of Rebels who destroyed the Death Star, thinking the young farm boy Jimm Doshun is actually Luke Skywalker. Thinking of the huge reward for capturing the boy who destroyed the Empire's greatest weapon, as well as the personal enjoyment of punishing someone who favors droids, Valance immediately sets off to find the boy. Jaxxon and Amaiza Foxtrain find out about his plan and go to Aduba-3 to warn Jimm that the bounty hunters are after him. A battle ensues when the gang arrives, and most of them are killed during the fight with the three Star-Hoppers. It is only then that Valance, the lone survivor of his gang, realizes that he was after the wrong boy the whole time, but he escapes by using the blaster built into his cybernetic arm, taking the others by surprise and leaving the planet in his ship Kill Switch."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars 16 marked the first appearance of bounty hunter Beilert Valance, a recurring character in both the Legends and canon continuities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Editions"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
