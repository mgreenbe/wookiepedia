However, despite the success of the mission, Darth Vader continued to doubt if the Emperor sent him to Bandomeer to simply get him out of the way, as he believed that he should be hunting Jedi like Dass Jennir. His doubts were confirmed afterwards, when he met with Commander Vill upon a cliff, overlooking the battlefields. Vill reported on the successful battle and the minor casualties the Imperials had suffered. Vader then asked Vill whether there was a Contingency Order for Vader's assassination, as there had been for the Jedi Order. Vill hesitated to answer, which led Vader to Force push the clone stormtrooper from the cliff, killing him, and then covering himself to a passing by clone stormtrooper by claiming that Vill had simply fell."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
