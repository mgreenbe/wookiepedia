By 25 ABY, he held the rank of Vice Admiral. His brother was once an AT-AT commander. Poinard always revered the Force and would always utter \"may the Force be with you\" during battle, if only to himself. By 25 ABY he commanded the Star Destroyer Erinnic and its support group. That year he was assigned to the Battle of Ord Mantell. Although command of his fleet was given over to New Republic general Yald Sutel, he retained titular captaincy of his ship. Poinard assisted Sutel in the failed defense of Ord Mantell."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
