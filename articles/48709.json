After the Jedi under Arca Jeth defeated the Lorell Raiders, who controlled Hapes and its large population of female slaves, the women of Hapes vowed that they would never again be ruled by a man. This led to the founding of the Hapan Royal House with the Queen Mother as its head. After coming to power, the first Queen Mother established the Queen's Pageant, as a parody of the slave trade under the Lorell Raiders. She also began the construction of the Star Home, the flagship of the Hapan Queen Mothers, which was still in use roughly 4,000 years later."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
