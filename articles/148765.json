As a child, she suffered from an illness that left her confined to a repulsorchair for the rest of her life. As the Galactic Empire began to oppress her sector and homeworld, Chan became one of the original founders of the Fest Resistance Group (FRG). Following the massacre of independent resistance fighters on neighboring Mantooine, Chan orchestrated the union of the FRG with the Mantooine Liberators into the Atrivis Resistance Group (ARG) and became its first and only military commander. Later the ARG was approached by Mon Mothma, a resistance leader who masterminded the creation of the pan-galactic Alliance to Restore the Republic, who urged them to join this wider union. After some deliberation, the ARG signed the Treaty of Generis, becoming an official ally of the Rebellion; Chan maintained her leadership throughout this transition, becoming the Atrivis sector Commander-in-Chief. While in this role, her disability kept her mainly confined to the Generis command base and its medical facilities; to compensate, her Chief of Staff, Loom Carplin, frequently acted as her eyes and ears off-world. When Carplin was off-world, Chan was aided by the Wookiee Busurra, an able administrator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Rebel Alliance transitioned into the New Republic, Chan remained on Generis, working at the Outer Rim Communications Center there. In 8 ABY, Generis was conquered by the resurgent Imperial forces under the command of Grand Admiral Thrawn. In this instance, he had personally planned the assault. While the entire communications facility was lost to the Imperials, Chan and those under her command were able to escape the planet with the aid of New Republic General Kryll after Commander Pash Cracken provided a distraction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The childhood illness suffered by Chan left her with a weak frame and physical infirmities resulting in her being confined to a repulsor chair.
