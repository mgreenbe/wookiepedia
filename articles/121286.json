This ship was almost captured during a battle against General Garm Bel Iblis, who used a pair of CC-7700 frigates to keep it from escaping into hyperspace. In an act of desperation, Daala took out one of the frigates by ramming the Scylla into it. This allowed Daala to jump into hyperspace\u2014but also severely damaged the Scylla's navigational systems. Daala's jump was a blind one, and she wasn't seen until the Second Galactic Civil War at least twenty years later to help out Gilad Pellaeon and the Imperial Remnant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Scylla is a creature from Greek mythology."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
