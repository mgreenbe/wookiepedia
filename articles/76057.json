Swan was also a two-time winner of the Obsidian Sphere. Eventually, her success as a bounty hunter caught the attention of Count Dooku who wanted her to compete with other bounty hunters in the Box, a death machine designed by Moralo Eval, on Serenno to win the honor of kidnapping Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. She witnessed Cad Bane murder another bounty hunter Bulduga to get his hat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon, Dooku briefed everyone on the challenge the bounty hunters had to face including telling them about The Box. They were all deprived of their weapons and soon they entered The Box.\nTheir first challenge was to escape a room that was filling with dioxis gas. Platforms began to rise from the ground and all the bounty hunters including Swan climbed on top of them. Another bounty hunter, Rako Hardeen who was actually Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi in disguise found a secret tunnel underneath the ground. All the hunters followed him through the tunnel, thus surviving the first round. However, Swan met her fate in the second round."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ledges began to slide out of the walls with a sword resembling a lightsaber swinging around on its front. Bulduga's brother Onca quickly fell prey to the blades. As before, Hardeen saw an open tunnel on the ceiling. Using the ledges, he and Bane hopped to the top towards the tunnel with the other bounty hunters following behind. In her attempt to escape this challenge, Kiera was hit by one of the ledges and the light blade impaled her, killing her instantly."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She was voiced by Ashley Eckstein who also voices Ahsoka Tano in Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Kiera Swan was a reference to the character Elizabeth Swann from the Pirates of the Caribbean movies played by Keira Knightley who previously played Amidala's handmaiden Sab\u00e9. Furthermore, the pirate-turned-bounty hunter's accomplishment of winning the Obsidian Sphere would be a reference to that franchise's pirate ship, the Black Pearl."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
