Kimm and Forrie boarded the freighter Cornucopia in an attempt to steal it, not knowing that six Null-class Advanced Recon Commandos were aboard along with an Imperial commando and the freighter's pilot. Both Kimm and Forrie were instantly killed by the commando Niner and Null ARC Ordo Skirata. When the Bothan, who was serving as the lookout for the group, lost his comlink connection with the two, he began to worry and left in their escape vehicle. He died when Niner blew his repulsortruck with a grenade launcher."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
