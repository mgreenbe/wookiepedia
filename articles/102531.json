While not intended as a long term substitute for a particular blood type, the synthesizer was widely used in emergency situations for short term treatment. In order to synthesize an artificial serum, the synthesizer needed a genetic sample (skin, hair, or blood). The unit, while expensive at 5,500 credits, was relatively common in most hospitals."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
