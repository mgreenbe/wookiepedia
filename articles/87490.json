This was part of a planetwide security crackdown in retaliation for Gorlan Palladane transmitting intelligence on the Chelloan baradium mining operations to both the Jedi Order and the rival Sith Lord Odion. The operation also sought to root out members of the Chelloan resistance and their family members. Daimanate Sith troopers pillaged and burnt Jenith, slaughtering much of its population. Much of the town was also burnt to the ground."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Palladane household was also invaded by two Sith troopers including an unmasked Human male. They pursued the Palladane family indoors, presumably to arrest or murder them due to their involvement in the Chelloan resistance. However, they were stopped by a lightsaber-wielding Jedi Knight Kerra Holt who slew both of them. She then went to rescue Gorlan from Daiman's prison, in the process rescuing several Chelloan leaders. The refugees were later evacuated to a safehouse in the town of Arboth where Palladane and Holt made efforts to evacuate the Chelloan people."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
