Tinto was employed by a bank situated on the planet Humbarine, but after Tinto illicitly embezzled funds from the bank, he was imprisoned by the Galactic Republic. Following his release, Tinto and several other former convicts established a small colony on the planet Longwind in the Trax sector, though he later left the settlement and journeyed to the moon Nar Shaddaa. However, a Humbarine industrialist held a grudge against Tinto as a result of an outstanding debt that the accountant owed and placed a bounty of 127,000 for Tinto's capture. The Trandoshan bounty hunter Cradossk subsequently tracked down Tinto on Nar Shaddaa and apprehended him, permanently disabling the accountant in the process. Cradossk later mentioned his capture of Tinto within his autobiography Making a Killing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
