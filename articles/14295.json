However, Kyp Durron, stationed at Bothawui, anticipated the attack, and brought his forces to the planet. Because of the lack of coralskippers, he was able to hold off the Yuuzhan Vong fleet until the Kubaz had evacuated all spaceworthy craft, although the planet did fall to the Yuuzhan Vong. As a result, Lah had Iinan sacrificed to the gods after the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
