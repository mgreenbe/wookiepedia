Zallow took over Leneer's training immediately, and she quickly learned that her life was to be dedicated solely to the Order and its teachings. Overtime, Leneer developed a strong, emotional bond with Master Zallow, as she perceived him not only as a teacher, but as a father. Leneer constructed multiple lightsabers; her first one was a blue-bladed lightsaber, another one was a yellow-hued bladed lightsaber, and the last one was a green-bladed lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Great Galactic War"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Comrade of Havoc Squad"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leneer was eventually made a Jedi Knight and was a member of Havoc Squad with Zeerid Korr in the early days of the Great Galactic War as she fought against the Sith Empire on behalf of the Galactic Republic. A formidable and well honed combatant with a lightsaber she was well respected by her squad mates. Aside from her skill with a lightsaber, Leneer developed her innate empathic abilities during the war, using it to booster morale among her comrades. Although she never consumed alcohol she would go to the cantinas with Havoc Squad after battles and training being a steadfast comrade and friend and would often be the shoulder to cry on after a nights hard drinking.

Wielding her lightsaber and the Force, Leneer fought besides Jedi Knight Satele Shan and helped turn the tide in order to repel the invasion. When Alderaan was secured, Leneer joined Jedi Shan as part of the Republic's delegation for the signing of a peace treaty with the Sith Empire. Led by Master Dar'Nala and Senator Paran Am-Ris, Leneer was stationed within the High Council building on Alderaan with fellow Knight Syo Bakarn. She was uncomfortable being stationed near so many Sith, but used Zallow's teachings to calm herself.

Leneer became extremely angry with the terms, believing that the Sith attack showed that they were clearly not interested in peace. and that the war should continue. She retired to her room where she dealt with the shock of her master's death. She then resolved to track down and kill the man who murdered their master. Although Syo attempted to convince her not to leave, she managed to escape the High Council building and depart for Eeseen spaceport.

Her attention then turned to the man who would fit the bill: Zeerid Korr. She began to search for him and located him outside his sister-in-law's apartment on the planet Vulta. Hitching a ride aboard the Fatman, Korr's ship, Leneer made it to Coruscant as part of her mission to discover her master's killer. Their ship was detected and shot down in Coruscant's atmosphere, but she used her strong force abilities to slow her and Zeerid's fall and they landed safely on the surface. Leneer proceeded to take Korr through the Works, an industrial area of Coruscant and managed to enter the Temple. Finding the Jedi Temple in ruins, Leneer located her astromech droid T7-01 and also found a recording of her master's death. She pieced together the clues as to her master's killer, discovering that it was the dreaded Darth Malgus who had led the attack. She later went back to the ruins of the Temple without Korr, who was busy scouting a spaceport to escape the planet through, and she entered into a fierce duel with the Sith Lord, who had also returned to the Temple. Following a lengthy display of athleticism, she fought to a draw and left the battle early when Zeerid learned where she was and interrupted the combat, rescuing her. Leneer, who was full of hate at that time, thought she could inflict more pain by killing Malgus' lover, Eleena Daru. Korr realized her plan and tried to convince her otherwise, but she refused to listen to him. Korr then explained the plan to escape Coruscant to her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two entered the spaceport and located a shuttle that they could escape the planet with. However, Leneer then located Eleena Daru and captured her. She prepared to kill her, but then learned of Daru's harsh treatment under Malgus's control and realized that she was making a mistake, and that her master would not want her to kill an innocent being. After she let go of her excess anger and hunger for revenge, Leneer decided to spare the Twi'lek and face Malgus one last time. She convinced Zeerid to escape, who eventually agreed after sharing a kiss with Leneer. Aryn then faced off one on one with Malgus. They entered into an intense battle, with Aryn using her lightsaber skills to fight and eventually injure Malgus. During the battle, they taunted each other, with Leneer allowing Malgus to see that she had regained who she was and would not fall to the dark side. Malgus eventually used his force abilities to gain an advantage, and overwhelmed Leneer with a blast of force lightning and ended the battle. However, noticing how Daru had been spared, the Sith stopped short of killing the Jedi. Leneer later awoke, and realized that Malgus had spared her.

In that instant, she summoned her lightsaber. Darth Malgus wanted to break his bonds to Vowrawn, the Sith Emperor, and realized that such psychological phenomena were practised by the late Jedi of the Dantooine Enclave.

Shan stated that she herself had similarly let go of her ties to the Jedi, and Leneer realized that the Order had changed when one of Shan's students, Syl, referred to the Jedi Master only by her first name. Syl spoke from the door of the meeting room, telling Shan that Master Sal-Deron wished to see her. After the student left, Satele Shan ushered Leneer out of the room, repeating that the Jedi Order had changed alongside many of its members. The Jedi further stated that the responsibility she once held belonged to others, and they must learn of Leneer's story before the ex-Jedi returned to her family. As the pair left the room and walked down the hallway outside, Leneer questioned whether everything else had really changed just as the Jedi did. Shan answered affirmatively, saying that regardless of how hard they fought change, the Jedi had always been familiar with it. Shan also expressed her feeling that more change was yet to come."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shan and Leneer then relayed the latter's news to Master Sal-Deron.

While Daeruun was preoccupied and could not join Leneer and the others on Odessen, he was ready to deploy military reinforcements where necessary.

Leneer went on to express her certainty that Gnost-Dural had told Peralun and the Commander about her past, and that while she did not wish to be involved in Jedi business again, she was determined to keep her family safe.

To maintain their discretion while making their way to the enclave, the group followed Leneer's lead through hidden access tunnels.

The group decided to find one such tunnel to enter the ruins, battling through local fauna, including several groups of xuvva, kath hounds, and zeldrates, as well as ambushes by Imperial soldiers. While they searched for a tunnel, the Alliance Commander asked of possible hostiles other than Imperials in the enclave ruins.

After they felled the beast, Leneer expressed her concern that she had no resistance in the caves when she first followed Malgus; while she had seen a few creatures in the tunnels, none of them were hostile towards her. The graul's aggression, the ex-Jedi believed, was a result of Malgus' actions that tipped the balance of the Force there. While the Sith Lord may not have done so intentionally, the Force in the caves felt unnatural to Leneer, who felt the echoes of pain and suffering that resonated within the tunnels\u2014pain and suffering that had been caused by betrayal and murder, ruthless acts of the Sith when they destroyed the enclave, and senseless deaths.
