Letta Turmond and Ahsoka Tano were held captive here after the Bombing of the Jedi Temple Hangar, the latter for the death of the former. At that time Whorm Loathsom, Poggle the Lesser, Wat Tambor, and a tactical droid were also held captive in the base. It was located in close proximity to the Venator-class Star Destroyer staging areas."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Inside the base, there was the First Battle Memorial, a large slab of Geonosian rock that showed the names of all the clones who fell in the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Interior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each hallway was either lined with a series of double ray shielded segments or contained a series of blast doors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This section had an area that was very comparable to the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center. The cells had two options for entering. The first was sliding a keycard. The second was pressing a button on the outside of each cell. The cells had ray shielded doors to make sure prisoners did not escape. Inside the cells there was a bed and bowls for water and food."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another area in the prison was a medium circle room with a fairly large computer for scanning people before they entered the base, a crate for weapons and communication devices, and a red button to start the red alert sequence."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Exterior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The main building was stationed with rapid repeating heavy turbo laser turrets and a series of deflector shields with two large projectors located right on the building."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The First Battle Memorial was built in the center of the Republic base's plaza, its purpose to honor the clone troopers that were killed in the Battle of Geonosis. Around this area are obelisks that have giant carvings of clone troopers on each side as well as flags bearing the colors in galactic roundel that signified the Republic."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Airfield"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Outside of the prison there was an airfield with Venator-class Star Destroyers, Juggernauts, and other ships with a refueling depot. When Ahsoka Tano escaped the prison in the facility, she went out onto the airfield with hopes of escaping the compound. It was normal to see clone trooper squads patrolling the base while walking on the airfield. The First Battle Memorial was also located here."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Military Tribunal Courtroom"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Inside of the compound there was a military tribunal courtroom of which the court decided on the fate of dangerous criminals. It was a tall room, with platforms extending into its center for the accused, prosecution, and defense. There was seating along its walls for the presiding official, jury, and other trial participants and onlookers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Letta Turmond was transferred to the base, because the bombing at the Jedi Temple had become a military matter. Admiral Tarkin reported that Letta had requested Ahsoka Tano's presence. At the base she was set up by an unseen person, who killed the prisoner and helped Ahsoka escape, making her look even more guilty in the process. Commander Fox, Anakin Skywalker, Captain Rex, ARF trooper \"Hound\", his massiff Grizzer, and other clones, hunted her down as she escaped from the facility."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Tano was recaptured, and with suspicions on her made even worse after being found near a canister of nanobots, she was then put on trial at the military base's tribunal courtroom.

To support this, in the episode \"The Jedi Who Knew Too Much\" the clones slowly stop taking orders from the Jedi. For instance, when Anakin was trying to get into the prison to see his Padawan, Commander Fox wouldn't let him in under Tarkin's orders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The base's courtroom, likewise, was also intended to emphasize the rise of the Galactic Empire. The production notes also indicated that the cylindrical tubes hanging from the ceiling were intended to invoke similar terminals seen on the Death Star.
