The home planet of the insectoid Geonosians, it was known for its droid factories and violent gladiatorial games. The desert world was the Confederacy of Independent Systems' first capital, hosting its major droid foundries. It was the site of the Battle of Geonosis, the opening conflict of the Clone Wars, in 22 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Geology and geography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Geonosis had a large diameter but light gravity and dense atmosphere. With a weak magnetic field, harsh solar radiation storms and massive sandstorms were common, and on occasion, mass extinctions occurred. The most persistent surface organisms were humble red rock algae while the semi-insectoid Geonosians were driven underground. The planet consisted of a diminutive molten core with a rocky mantle forming a rocky, desert world subject to flash floods that carved great highland canyons. Water made up 5% of the surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the Geonosian rule, much of the planet's architecture was similar in appearance to termite mounds, consisting of domes and buildings built into caverns and rock spires.

This event killed off more than 99% of Geonosis's native species. Over millions of years, the few creatures who survived the devastation slowly reclaimed the planet. Random meteor impacts constantly weeded out the weaker species, leaving only the truly cunning, hardy, and ruthless species alive. The insectoid Geonosians, the dominant life form on the planet, constituted all three. Ruled in various independent hives, great wars would periodically break out on the planet's surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Geonosis was first explored by the greater galaxy when miners settled nearby Tatooine around 4000 BBY. The technically-minded Geonosians were fascinated by the outsiders' technology and proved adept at finding new efficiencies in devices' function and production. This period saw the foundation of the first droid foundries, and the Geonosians developed labor droids in their own image."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Great Galactic War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the Great Galactic War, Geonosis was famous for the gladiatorial games held on the planet.

Additionally, contact with outsiders caused a deep rift among the hives that soon erupted into yet more savage warfare. Geonosis was abandoned by the greater galaxy and it was not until the Republic's final centuries that scouts and merchants reestablished contact.

The Separatists, in turn, introduced battle droids to the arena, triggering the Battle of Geonosis, the first battle of the Clone Wars, as Jedi reinforcements, led by Master Mace Windu, revealed themselves among the public and entered the arena to confront the droids. After a long battle between the droids and the Jedi, Grand Master Yoda arrived with the newly-formed Republic army and rescued the defeated Jedi forces.

However, the factory turned out to be very heavily guarded, and the assault met with heavy losses of men and material.The Geonosians deployed several squadrons of Nantex-class territorial defense starfighters that decimated the landing force, even before landing.

Outside, the tactical droid had sent out a dozen tanks to rupture them. They were all destroyed by a sense of ingenuity by the Jedi Masters.

Geonosian scientists and slaves also played a role in the construction of the Death Star, and the Death Star's test bed was once moved temporarily to Geonosis.

The Geonosians were primarily used for slave labor by the Empire. However, in 0 BBY, a Geonosian revolt was instigated by Rebel forces, who had built a secret base on Geonosis. Darth Vader, leading an invasion force, was sent to crush the revolt in what became the Subjugation of Geonosis.

In 3 ABY, while chasing an Imperial carrier that had interfered with the Rebel Alliance's raid on the Empire's operations on Bakura, Wedge Antilles visited Geonosis and found several completely operational B1-Series battle droids left over from the war, as well as a Jedi starfighter, which he used to escape the planet. Soon after, the droid operations were put down by the Galactic Empire, which ultimately brought an official end to the Geonosian Separatist holdouts. During that battle, three Imperial escort carriers ended up being destroyed. Sarkli took cover from the battle droids in a crashed, but working, LAAT/i. The surviving stormtroopers were killed by the battle droids. After the death of Emperor Palpatine, Geonosis established an isolationist policy.
