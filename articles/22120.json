It had an open passenger compartment and was designed to allow infantry commanders to move around and observe the battlefield and was equipped with a long-range com unit equivalent to an OmniNode ComSet. It was piloted by a single person who sat in a swoop-like seat in front of the passenger compartment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was well armored, but the open passenger compartment and lack of weapons made this vehicle suitable for scouting only. Later versions often added an E-Web repeating blaster mount behind the pilot for defense."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While it was a common in the latter years of the Galactic Republic, the CMD-1 was unpopular and production discontinued following the creation of the Galactic Empire. During the reign of the Empire the CMD-1 remained in use with small military and paramilitary units throughout the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
