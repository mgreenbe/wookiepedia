Most of the Defiance's pilots were away flying other missions but the ship was able to scramble three X-wings and two R-22 Spearheads in its defense. The Rebel pilots, including Keyan Farlander and Breth Gart were able to defend it until the ship was safely in hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the evacuation of Yavin 4, the Alliance High Command requested her presence in order to protect the Rebel ships about to hyperspace away from the Imperial blockade.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The vessel performed numerous missions, both individually and as part of a battle line. The Defiance was commanded by Admiral Nammo throughout the Galactic Civil War.

This theory was based on the fact that there were only three named Home One type cruisers known at that time. Her sister ships, the Independence and the Home One, are known to have survived the battle, leaving the Defiance the one most likely to have been destroyed. However, according to the Defiance card from the Jedi Knights Trading Card Game, the ship survived the battle and pursued Imperial starships afterward."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Additionally, six years after the Battle of Endor, the New Republic built a new type of Mon Calamari cruiser: the MC90 Star Cruiser and the first ship constructed was called the Defiance. This led to the belief that the first Defiance was indeed destroyed and that the second one's name was a tribute to the first. However, in addition to being incorrect, the assumption that the name of the MC90 Defiance is a tribute is not logical if one looks at the real-world sources for these ships\u2014the MC90 Defiance is from 1991/1992 Star Wars: Dark Empire, while the first Defiance is from the 1993 Star Wars: X-Wing game."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Issue 99 of Computer Gaming World, released in October 1992, featured a preview of Star Wars: X-wing which described transitions between missions taking place on the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser Dreadnought and at a Calamari space port.
