For centuries, the royal assemblage of Velmor bred the creatures and would engage in a ceremonial act known as a Mrid Hunt. The hunt harkened back to the years when natives of Velmor were forced to travel as pack hunters just to survive. Three years after the Battle of Yavin, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker and Prince Denid participated in a Mrid Hunt in the capitol city of Den Velmor. They rode astride large Ycaqts and broke into small parties to chase the mrids into the surrounding forests. Mrids had highly developed survival instincts and were adept at making themselves difficult to find, making the hunt a challenge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mrids first appeared in Star Wars 49, written by Mike W.
