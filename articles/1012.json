Since the standard-issued clones were far less immersed in the Mandalorian culture, and also indoctrinated to be absolutely loyal to the Galactic Republic without question, they disliked the clone commandos for blatantly putting their Mandalorian heritage above their loyalty to the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 2nd Airborne Company fought General Grievous's droid forces during the Battle of Utapau in 19 BBY, and later helped subjugate Utapau following the transmission of Order 66."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Units"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Parjai Squad was one of many units that comprised the 2nd Airborne Company."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Specialized Armor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clone troopers of the 2nd Airborne Company were outfitted with helmets designed for high altitude drops.
