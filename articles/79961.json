Joining the Galactic Republic, they avoided direct representation in the Galactic Senate due to their anti-alien laws. While the crop output was not enough to create a substantial offworld market, there was enough demand for damotite that a sufficient profit could be made. However as the years passed the market for damotite dwindled as trenomite became the preferred mineral. As jobs became scarce, the Lanteebans were forced to look offworld for jobs; however, their xenophobic natures more times than not caused them to lose any job they obtained."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars a Tibanna gas hauler was passing through the system as it made repairs on its journey to Ryoone when it detected a Separatist fleet moving towards Lanteeb. A Republic agent on the gas hauler notified Senator Bail Prestor Organa of this occurrence and the Senator immediately asked the assistance of Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. While no records of the planet were to be found in the Jedi Archives, Padawan Ahsoka Tano discovered mention of the planet in the financial records of the Kaliida Shoals Medical Center. Records indicated that two vials of damotite poisoning antidotes had been shipped to the world at great expense."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
