It used sound waves to temporarily blind and weaken enemy units within its vicinity, though it could also be lethal if said units were in close proximity to it upon detonation. It bore a strong resemblance to the C-25 fragmentation grenade."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
