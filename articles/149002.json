Up to sixty-four Hammerhead-class cruisers could be connected to the Tremendous at any one time, and the dozens of ships gave the slow-moving Tremendous plenty of defense. Like other Inexpugnable-class ships, the Tremendous featured the class's trademark \"wishing-well\" bridge configuration, where visual and electronic data was displayed holographically over a transparent deck."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tremendous had a width of 3,100 meters, and while the capital ship was able to enjoy the protection of its phalanx of Hammerhead cruisers, it had an armament that included five double turbolaser batteries, five light turbolaser batteries, two point-defense laser cannons, and two tractor beam batteries, all of which combined required sixty-six gunners to operate. The Courageous also could contain a sizable complement of ships, including up to 144 Aurek-class tactical strikefighters, twenty-four S-250 Chela-class starfighters, twenty-four Conductor-class short-haul landing craft, six Ministry-class orbital shuttles, and other support craft. Equipped with a navicomputer, a Class 2 hyperdrive, and a Class 10 unit as a backup, the Tremendous could hold 50,000 tons of cargo and two years' worth of consumables.
