He, along with many other clones, was bred by the Kaminoan cloners on the planet Kamino for use in the Grand Army of the Republic. Taler was trained as a clone commando and assigned to serve as the sergeant of Theta Squad, commanding fellow commandos Darman, Vin, and Jay. The squad was first deployed in 22 BBY during the first battle of the Clone Wars on the planet Geonosis. There they fought against Geonosians serving the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and supported Delta Squad, another squad of commandos. After Darman cleared a doorway for Delta with explosives, Theta squad covered their rear as they progressed. Taler, along with Vin and Jay were overwhelmed by Geonosians and killed as they provided cover leaving Darman as the sole surviving member of Theta."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Taler was first mentioned in Republic Commando: Hard Contact a novel written by Karen Traviss and released in 2004.
