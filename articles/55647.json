Gormdin was the only habitable world in the Sarrelon system, possessing a breathable atmosphere and standard gravity. Four oceans occupied 60% of the moon's surface and its land masses were covered by plains, plateaus, and forests composed of trees ranging from 1.5 to 2 meters tall. Small forested areas on the plateaus supported the Gorms, a sentient species native to the world. There was no planet-wide system of government on Gorm; the moon's several cities conducted trade, but each maintained its own laws and government."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the early years of the New Republic, Lohn Genden and his band of terrorists were based in a network of caves beneath one of Gormdin's plateaus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
