In the early days of the war, the Banking Clan invested heavily in the creation of a new droid factory for the Separatist Droid Army to be built on the Outer Rim world of Geonosis. The factory was a joint venture with the Trade Federation, necessitating that Clovis work alongside fellow covert Confederate operative, Senator Lott Dod, and Geonosian Archduke Poggle the Lesser. Unbeknownst to Clovis, the Jedi High Council suspected him of treason, and so asked his former flame, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, to gather information on his dealings. Under the belief that Amidala was interested in resurrecting their relationship, Clovis allowed the Naboo Senator to accompany him to a meeting with Dod and Poggle on Cato Neimoidia, during which she discovered his allegiance to the Confederacy and his investments in the new Geonosian droid foundry."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before Amidala could relate this information back to the Jedi Order, she was poisoned by Dod, who hoped to use her as leverage over Clovis in their financial dealings.

Their relationship eventually became romantically charged, and Amidala was driven to request a return to professional decorum between the two, as she was primarily focused on her duties as a senator at the time.

During the Separatist Crisis, a number of sectors and corporations declared their intentions to leave the Republic and form a Confederacy of Independent Systems; InterGalactic Banking Clan Chairman San Hill was among the corporate executives who contributed to the creation of the Confederacy, and became a founding member of the Separatist Council.

The Banking Clan avoided any public connection to the Separatists, allowing Clovis to retain his position in the Senate. The Scipio Senator continued to represent the interests of the IBC in the early days of the war, but was in reality pursuing a Confederate agenda and became involved in activities that would be considered treasonous if discovered by Republic authorities. On behalf of the Banking Clan, Clovis entered into a business venture with Trade Federation Senator Lott Dod in 21 BBY. Like Clovis, Dod represented a Confederate financier, but was able to retain his position by claiming that Federation goods were being co-opted without the approval of the conglomerate's governing board. The two jointly invested in a new Confederate droid foundry to be built on Geonosis that, when completed, would be the largest battle droid factory ever built. The Senators both expected large returns on their investment, but Dod eventually became heavily indebted to the Banking Clan, and was forced to sign over much of his holdings over the Neimoidian purse world of Cato Neimoidia to Clovis's organization. The Scipio senator then used the Neimoidian's payments as collateral on loans used to build new armies and warships for the Confederacy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This left Clovis as the primary beneficiary of the new foundry's profits.

Amidala initially refused, but later accepted the mission after learning the details of the Council's request. In order to fulfill her assignment, Amidala contacted Clovis and indicated that she was interested in becoming friends once more.

Eager to become romantically involved with Amidala once more, Clovis indicated that he would be happy to ease her loneliness upon his return from a trip to Cato Neimoidia. The two discussed their separate dealings with the Neimoidians, although Clovis masked his true business with them by claiming that his trip was to collect on a Banking Clan loan to the Trade Federation.

The pilot was in fact Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, undercover as Amidala's protector for the duration of the her espionage mission. Unbeknownst to even the Jedi Council, Skywalker and Amidala had secretly married at the beginning of the Clone Wars; the Jedi Knight was extremely jealous of his wife's fabricated infatuation with Clovis, as well as her previous relationship with the Senator. Upon boarding the skiff, Skywalker intentionally broke the harness on the seat next to Amidala's in an attempt to separate the two senators for the duration of the flight to Cato Neimoidia.

While Clovis led Amidala and C-3PO to meet with the Neimoidian Senator, Skywalker stayed behind with the star skiff, waiting for his wife to send him a message that she had secured incriminating data on Clovis. Upon entering the palace, Clovis and Amidala split up, with the Naboo Senator taking leave to her room while the Scipio Senator followed Dod to the palace's library. Away from Amidala's eyes, Dod was able to reveal to Clovis the holographic plans for their new droid foundry. Although they were both optimistic about the project, Dod was concerned by Amidala's presence, as he feared she may reveal their plans to the Republic. The two were joined in their meeting by Poggle the Lesser, Archduke of Geonosis and founding member of the Separatist Council, who would oversee the construction and operation of the factory.

While Clovis escorted Amidala back to her room to prepare for dinner, Poggle and Dod confided in one another their unwillingness to operate under Clovis's demands and ultimately devised a plan to poison Amidala in order to gain bargaining leverage over their co-conspirator. The plan was put into action just before dinner, when Dod enticed Amidala to drink from a cup with poison on its rim. Following the dinner, Clovis offered to take his guest on a tour of the palace, which ultimately led the two of them to the library. After brief moments of discussion, Amidala requested that Clovis fetch her a glass of water. While he was gone, she hacked into the hologram terminal and stole the hologram disc on the droid foundry. Clovis returned a short time later and nearly discovered Amidala's deception, but the Naboo Senator was able to distract him by embracing him in a hug and claiming that she had missed his company."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Clovis was focused on Amidala's flirtation, Skywalker was able to enter the library and relieve his wife of the data. However, before Amidala could leave with him, the poison took its effects and caused her to lose consciousness.

Dod countered his claims by asserting that he had been betrayed by the Naboo Senator, as she was a Republic spy. Furious, Clovis returned to the library to check the status of the foundry plans. Upon discovering that they were missing, he rushed back to Amidala's room to demand that she return the hologram disc. Amidala admitted to deceiving him, but asserted that it was for the good of the Republic. Although she didn't want to believe that her old love had committed treason, she fulfilled her duty and sent the disc to the Senate and Jedi Council. Their conversation was interrupted by Skywalker, who threatened to kill Clovis if he didn't back away from Amidala.

As Skywalker carried Amidala, Clovis led the way toward the palace's exit. They were intercepted by Dod, who insisted that Amidala stay on Cato Neimoidia. Although Clovis attempted to lie by claiming that authorities on Naboo had instructed him to return her to Coruscant, Dod was adamant in keeping her in his palace. With little time to spare, Clovis pulled a hold-out pistol on his Neimoidian contemporary and demanded that he surrender the antidote.
