To prevent Governor Azadi from taking over Pryce Mining, Renking convinced Arihnda to sell her family firm to the Galactic Empire. Arihnda and Renking also managed to clear Elainye's name by pinning the blame on the Lutrillian heavy equipment inventory operations manager Pomi Harchmak.

Realizing the gravity of the situation, Talmoor and Elainye obliged and reluctantly left their home and mining business.

In truth, his mission was to plant explosives in order to knock out the insurgents' DSS-02 regional shield. Unaware of Gudry's true mission, Talmoor told him that there was nobody in the mine who wasn't there of his or her own free will. He contended they were fighting for peoples' rights against a repressive and dangerous government."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Pryce pointed out that he was painting the Empire with \"too wide a brush\", Elainye pointed out the corruption of Governor Restos.

The ensuing explosion killed all insurgents inside the deflector shield radius but also killed numerous civilians and the Imperial troops that Colonel Wullf Yularen had sent to rescue Arihnda.
