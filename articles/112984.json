In this time, a new patriarch was born known as Hallow Voice who proposed a foreign line of thinking that involved co-existence with alien species. Red Walker became one of many Esh-kha that were the followers of Hallow Voice. However, his peoples rampage across the galaxy attracted the attention of the Infinite Empire and the Rakata imprisoned all the surviving Esh-kha including Red Walker in stasis on the prison world of Belsavis. For millennia, Red Walker remained trapped in this state until the Barsen'thor freed him during the Cold War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
