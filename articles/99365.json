After the Imperial survey team discovered starship-manufacturing minerals beneath the surface, factories and mining facilities were dispatched within a week, along with a major garrison. Almost overnight, entire sectors of Capital City were emptied to pave the way for Imperial structures, and the citizens of Lothal responded with mass protests, resulting in mass arrests and crackdowns. Lothal's planetary government was pushed aside while an Imperial governorship was established."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
