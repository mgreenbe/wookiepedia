Fil served as a Clone Commander in the Grand Army of the Republic, during the galaxy wide conflict between the Galactic Republic  and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Clone Wars. Early into the war, Fil was assigned to the Mon Calamari Jedi Knight Nahdar Vebb, and served under him during several battles in the early Clone Wars. Fil was the leader of a squad that accompanied Vebb to Vassek 3, the third moon of Vassek."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Tracking Gunray"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the moons surface, Vebb was reunited with his former master, the Nautolan Jedi Master Kit Fisto, who was joining them on their mission to recapture Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray, who had escaped Republic capture with the aid of Asajj Ventress. Inspecting a Lair that they assumed Gunray was hiding out in, Fil ordered two of his men, Bel and Niner, to remain with the Nu-class attack shuttle they had arrived in. Fisto denied Fil's use of a\u00a0thermal detonator\u00a0to open the lair's door, and instead pressed a secret stone that activated the entrance."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Lair of Grievous"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once inside the fortress, they took notice of a faint voice, that of Gunray, speaking with B1-series battle droids. Gunray, unbeknownst to the Jedi and clones, was in\u00a0holographic form\u00a0in order to lure the Jedi into the trap. The group attacked, quickly destroying the droids, however Vebb used\u00a0the Force\u00a0to\u00a0turn\u00a0Gunray's chair around, revealing the hologram of the Viceroy. After Gunray activated a homing beacon near his chair, his hologram faded away. Count Dooku contacted the Jedi, telling the group that while Gunray was unavailable for capture, he offered them an unnamed alternative prize. Fisto and Vebb knew that they had been tricked into the lair, and it was some form of a trap. Fil was worried about the current situation after the group walked down a dark hallway."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon exploration of the fortress, it soon became clear is was no ordinary hideaway. Seeing Kaleesh statues and cyborg parts, Fisto came to the realization that they had been tricked into the lair of General Grievous, leader of the Droid Army.

Fil and his men drew their\u00a0blasters, but Grievous did not comply with Fisto's demands for surrender and ignited four\u00a0lightsabers. The Jedi managed to contain him, severing one of his\u00a0cybernetic\u00a0hands. Fil ordered his men to use\u00a0grappling hooks\u00a0to hold Grievous, while Vebb and Fisto tried to finish Grievous off. Grievous released himself from the clones, but Fisto severed Grievous's cyborg body in half from the waist down. The cyborg general fled from the area and entered the lair's secret command center. The battle with Grievous had resulted in the loss of two clone troopers, leaving only Fil and\u00a0one last trooper\u00a0alongside the Jedi. Fil and the other survivors tried to flee from the castle, but Grievous trapped them by shutting the outer doors. Fil contacted Bel and Niner, who were guarding their\u00a0shuttle, and ordered them to contact their fleet, which was near the Inner Rim  of\u00a0Bestine IV, for more clone trooper reinforcements. However, one of Grievous's\u00a0IG-100 MagnaGuards, who had been watching the ship, \u00a0used a\u00a0missile launcher\u00a0to\u00a0destroy it, killing both Bel and Niner and preventing a call for help."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Jedi, Fil and the other surviving clone ran through the fortress, Grievous unleashed his next trap, opening up  floor beneath their feet, which dropped down to a molten incinerator pit. While the Jedi avoided it, both clones fell, Fil using his grappling hook to save himself. The other clone, however, was not so lucky, and perished in the pit, leaving Fil the last of his squad.

Upon the arrival of the best, Fil fired his blaster pistol at its head, which was deflected from Gor's\u00a0head armor. The roggwart disarmed Fisto, and Vebb ordered Fil to shoot and distract Gor while he himself\u00a0jumped onto the creature. However, when Vebb stabbed Gor in the back with his lightsaber, Gor used his long tail to grab Fil, and lift the struggling commander off the ground. As Gor held onto Fil with his tail, both of the Jedi tried to save the clone commander, but it was too late. Fisto slashed at the roggwart's face with his lightsaber; Fil was slammed hard onto the floor by Gor and was instantly killed on impact."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two Jedi cut off Gor's tail, which dumped the now lifeless Fil on the ground. Gor was then killed, and Vebb had little time to mourn the loss of the commander, before going to face Grievous, wanting revenge for his comrades deaths.
