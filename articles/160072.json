Vemrin became a self-proclaimed enemy of the new acolyte tutored by Overseer Tremel. Vemrin sent Dolgis to ambush and attack the new acolyte, but the latter would survive this encounter. During their final trial, Vemrin was ordered to go to Baras' quarters and await further instructions, while his rival ventured into the Tomb of Naga Sadow to retrieve an ancient lightsaber. Vemrin disobeyed Baras and sought to kill the acolyte in the tomb, but his arrogance proved to be his undoing as his rival managed to kill him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vemrin was both ruthless and strong in the Force, having already earned some favor with Baras by the time Tremel's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 arrived in Korriban.
