A complicated device with unknown origins, the mask was effective in blunting mental attacks. If a Force-sensitive was to don this piece of equipment, they would find themselves suddenly disoriented, as device's effects would blunt a Jedi or Sith's own connection to the Force. A few of these masks fell into the hands of mercenaries and others in the years after the Jedi Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
