The BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bomber, designed in the conflict's early stages as a combination starfighter and long-range bomber as a replacement for V-19 Torrent and Jedi interceptors, became a mainstay of the Republic Navy during the conflict. Koensayr was spurred to produce several variants in the Y-wing series, including the BTL-A4 and BTL-S3, as well as many of their parts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Imperial Navy placed their emphasis on the doctrine that space superiority was won and held with capital warships. This meant that hyperdrive-equipped snub-fighters fell out of favor, and Koensayr lost its important government contract. Because of this, it was forced to sell much of its stock to local planetary defense markets, although many of their craft eventually ended up in the hands of the Alliance to Restore the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebel Alliance's use of the Y-wing caused Koensayr to restart the Y-wing line with its BTA-NR2 Y-wing, which featured a stripped hull and single pilot seat in the vein of the BTL-A4."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Koensayr also manufactured flight gear, such as the K-22995 light flight helmet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
