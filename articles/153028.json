A hermaphrodite like the rest of his species, the Hutt had a masculine personality. Sometime between 3647\u20133642 BBY, after a severe groundquake on the planet where his palace was located, the Hutt began to hoard medpacs in his palace and sold them at a high rate in order to profit from the devastation. However, the combat medic Archiban Kimble, better known as Doc, forged a false death mark against a local clan of Mandalorian warriors in the Hutt's name. As a result, the Mandalorians attacked the Hutt's palace, and while both the Hutt and the attacking Mandalorians killed each other during the battle, Doc stole medpacs from the palace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The unnamed Hutt was first mentioned in the conversation \"Anonymous\" with the Jedi Knight companion character Doc in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, which was released by BioWare and LucasArts in 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
