After being disabled by Slave I's ion cannons, the shuttle was taken over by Din Djarin and Marshal Cara Dune. The shuttle was subsequently used as part of the plan to rescue Grogu from Moff Gideon's forces. After pretending to be under attack by Slave I, the shuttle crash-landed into the launch tube of Gideon's light cruiser. Afterwards, Cara Dune, Bo-Katan Kryze, Koska Reeves, and Fennec Shand assaulted the hangar, with Din Djarin not far behind."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shuttle 2743 first appeared in \"Chapter 16: The Rescue\" of Jon Favreau's 2019 Disney+ television series The Mandalorian, directed by Peyton Reed and released on December 18, 2020."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
