They were cheap and reliable, and were powered by an energy cell rather than a power pack. Electrobolt rifles fired bolts of condensed electrical energy and were more useful for jolting and stunning a target into unconsciousness than actually killing them. It typically took four hits to kill most targets. Gorog warriors of the Dark Nest were armed with them, as well as tridents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
