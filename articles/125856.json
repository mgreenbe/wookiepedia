Huxley instructed Sinker to confiscate Jade Skywalker's lightsaber. Once he took the weapon, Jade Skywalker used the Force to ignite and move the lightsaber while he still held it, creating a distraction that allowed her husband, Luke Skywalker, to assist.

After he became a legitimate businessman, Karrde sent his long-time agent Mara Jade Skywalker to Huxley's Outer Rim cantina to sever their working relationship.
