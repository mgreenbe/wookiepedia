The pair rented out a tower in the castle of the pirate Maz Kanata on the planet Takodana, and there offered cosmetic surgery to those who wanted to disappear. When the criminal Ryn Biggleston hired the services of Thromba and Laparo after killing her partner in crime BeeLee Amdas, the pair transformed Biggleston's appearance to that of Amdas without her knowing and stole a hoard of credits she had hidden near the castle. The patient then fled without paying, but was soon arrested when the criminal Amdas' appearance was recognized."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thromba and Laparo were later present in the castle's main hall when the smuggler Han Solo entered with the scavenger Rey, the former stormtrooper Finn and the astromech droid BB-8.
