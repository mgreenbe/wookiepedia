They performed unethical experiments on sapient races in the bunker bellow the White Thranta Shipping offices, without Jabba the Hutt being aware of it. Ziam's plan was to use the White Thranta Shipping Company to make enough money to eventually break away from Jabba. Circa 1 ABY, Jabba's employee Reimos Taligg tasked a spacer to slice the computers of the White Thranta bunker, eventually discovering the situation. Reimos then requested the spacer to question Brok Ziam but Ziam refused, forcing the spacer to kill him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Brok Ziam was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
