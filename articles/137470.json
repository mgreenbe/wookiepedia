Karrde's people had earlier picked up an urgent transmission, addressed to Luke, coming from Admiral Voss Parck on the planet Nirauan. Before the message could be passed on, however, it had been stolen by a member of Karrde's own organization, one Dean Jinzler.

The Chiss have found the remains of the pioneering Jedi expedition, Outbound Flight project, which had been mercilessly destroyed by Grand Admiral Thrawn many years previously. Now the Chiss wish to hand over their find to the New Republic, and Luke and Mara join the odd group, which includes a squad of stormtroopers from the 501st, a remnant of an alien people, the Geroons, who owe a strange debt to the people of Outbound Flight, and a false New Republic Ambassador, all of whom will visit the site of the tragedy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they voyage on the Chaf Envoy deeper into Chiss space, through a treacherous cluster of stars known as the Redoubt, Luke and Mara grow more uneasy.

Not only are the ships fairly intact, but Mara can sense life. There are survivors, possibly hundreds of them. Suddenly, everything comes together in a whirlwind of events. The supposedly peace-loving Geroons are revealed to be the bloodthirsty Vagaari, who desire revenge against the Chiss and Outbound Flight for their defeat at the hand of Grand Admiral Thrawn years before. Luke, Mara, the Chiss, the Imperials, and the embittered survivors must now work together against the Vagaari if any of them are to come out alive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They manage to defeat the Vagaari, who in turn sabotage the Chaf Envoy and commandeer one of the Dreadnaughts. The Vagaari then head back through the Redoubt to attack the Chiss command center, leaving Luke, Mara, and the others practically stranded. Following the welcome discovery of a Delta-Twelve Skysprite, however, Luke and Mara are soon pursuing the rogue Dreadnaught. They catch up to it and make their way aboard. They find out that the main Vagaari \"colony ship\" is actually a starfighter carrier that is beginning to overwhelm Chiss defenses. Using a fake signal, Luke and Mara trick the Vagaari into believing the Dreadnaught to be a friendly ship. However, Luke and Mara use the Dreadnaught under their control after a showdown with a droideka and the fanatical Vagaari Estosh, to aid the Chiss fighters and to defeat the other Vagaari forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The survivors are entrusted into the care of the Empire of the Hand, and Luke and Mara finally have time to settle down and enjoy their marriage. But one disquieting thought occurs to Mara: the whole affair, resulting in a resounding victory for the Chiss, feels too much like something orchestrated by Thrawn, a master at manipulating his allies and enemies alike. When Luke objects that they (inadvertently) killed the clone of Thrawn beneath his base on Nirauan, Mara counters that it was possible, even likely, for Thrawn to have prepared other clones and scattered them around the Unknown Regions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Development"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The book was intended to be a counterpart to Tatooine Ghost, featuring Mara Jade and Luke instead of Han and Leia.
