It was to cover Shaak Ti leading a mission to rescue Republic clone trooper prisoners of war from the planet Dagu, where they were being held captive by Dark Acolyte Artel Darc. It was to be published in March 2004, and was set 9 months after the First Battle of Geonosis. The book was to be part of the Clone Wars multimedia project."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The story was apparently completed when it was decided to scrap it in favor of Yoda: Dark Rendezvous, due to the greater public appeal of Yoda. However, Darc, Dagu, and Shaak Ti's mission were referenced in Republic HoloNet News Core Edition 14:3:22 and The Official Star Wars Fact File 116, making the general storyline of Escape from Dagu still canon within the continuity of Star Wars Legends."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Official site description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "William Dietz, author of the Dark Forces novellas, returns to Star Wars with Escape from Dagu.
