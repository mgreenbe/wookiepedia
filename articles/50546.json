Fuller gained possession of the Freebooter after his previous ship, the Croc of Gold, was destroyed in a clash with Imperial forces near Tashtor Seneca. The Freebooter suffered a similar fate: it was wrecked when the Alliance base at Ansarra fell under attack by an Imperial Star Destroyer. Fuller did not perish in the destruction of the Freebooter and the Alliance loaned him a Ghtroc Industries Class 720 freighter called The Solar Flair so that he could continue working on their behalf."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
