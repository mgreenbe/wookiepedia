However, while chatting, Darth Sidious executed Order 66, causing the entire 13th Battalion to turn on the two Jedi. The two made their way to the escape pods. Cal was able to climb into a pod untouched, Tapal was not so fortunate having multiple blaster wounds. As the escape pod plummeted towards the planet, in his dying breaths Tapal told his padawan to wait for the Jedi Council's signal. Cal's connection to the Force broke and he kept his master's lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cal spent five years working as a scrapper for the Scrapper Guild, an organization active during the Imperial Era. In 14 BBY, during a scrapping incident, Cal was forced to use the Force to save his friend, Prauf from falling into a Ibdis Maw.

As Purge Troopers took aim at the scrappers, when Prauf defiantly spoke out, confronting and shaming the Empire as a whole for overworking the Scrapper Guild. The Second Sister in response then executed Prauf, and his friend, Cal Kestis, reacted by trying to cut her down with his lightsaber, revealing himself as the Jedi. She blocked Kestis' attack with her double-bladed spinning lightsaber, and lifted him with the Force, throwing him over to the Ninth Sister, who then dropped him off the ledge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi survived the fall, landing onto a train. Fighting his way through countless hordes of stormtroopers, including TK-8190. While he fought his way towards the front carriage, Cere Junda arrived aboard the Stinger Mantis to extract him. When the Jedi attempted to board the Mantis, the Second Sister shot at the ship from her TIE/IN interceptor. The Jedi fell onto a platform, where the Second Sister then landed her TIE to confront him. From his stance, she identified that he had underwent training and questioned his master. The two briefly fought, until the Mantis returned, shooting at them and separating the two. The Jedi limped onto the ship as Junda shot at the Second Sister until the door closed. The Second Sister then latched onto the cockpit window and used the Force to alter the steering. Junda, however, took back control of this and the Second Sister was shaken off the window, allowing the Mantis to escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cal Kestis joined the Mantis crew as they continued their journey across the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The escape appeared in the 2019 video game, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order by Respawn Entertainment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
