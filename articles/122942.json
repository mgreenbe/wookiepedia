This base contained ample supplies of medications, weapons, ship repair parts, and foodstuffs. The base was defended by six Vulture droids. Towards the end of the Clone Wars, the Jedi High Council received a tip about the asteroid storage base's existence. Seeking to alleviate starving worlds, the Jedi launched a mission to raid the base. However, Jedi Master Quinlan Vos, an undercover Separatist agent working for Count Dooku, sabotaged the operation by planting explosives in the asteroid base. This resulted in an explosion that destroyed most of the contents inside; effectively sabotaging the Galactic Republic's war effort."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
