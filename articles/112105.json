Rays were considered to be good swimmers, thanks to the powerful caudal fin. The large head and wide mouth dominated much of the body and were able to distend to hold the carnivorous fish's prey. They were visually colorful, with blue scales, a white belly, and red-and-yellow eyes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behavior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ray was one of the many prey of the opee sea killer, a larger sea creature native to the depths of Naboo. Several rays could be snatched by the tongue of the opee as it hunted. They were also fed upon by diving aiwhas. On Naboo, rays were found in the Naboo Abyss. They were especially abundant around the underwater Gungan city of Otoh Gunga, but they favored open waters and surface oceans. Though they were attracted by the lights of Otoh Gunga, they knew by experience not to swim through the gelatinous substance that led to the air-filled chambers. Both the Gungans and Humans, known as the Naboo on the Mid Rim world, considered the ray an excellent sportfish, as it put up a strong fight and often made spectacular leaps from the water."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rays were native to the Mid Rim planet Naboo, and were also introduced to its moon Ohma-D'un as part of a Gungan colonization effort after the Invasion of Naboo, which occurred in 32 BBY.
