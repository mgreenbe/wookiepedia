Skywalker manages to disarm Ventress, but she leaps into the tree canopy, her lightsabers following shortly after. The duel takes them high into the trees, branches and vines of Yavin. Eventually, they exit the foliage and Skywalker follows Ventress to the roof of a Massassi temple. Ventress hurls stones and masonry at him, then Force-pushes Skywalker across the ground. His clothes torn and tattered, Skywalker stands and faces his enemy. As it starts to rain heavily, the two combatants stand motionless, lightsabers at the ready."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}]}
