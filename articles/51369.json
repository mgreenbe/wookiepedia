The repulsor ray developed by the Empire focused G-waves produced by hundreds of low-yield repulsor motors into a devastating field capable of disrupting planetary crusts. The ray's G-wave output was comparable to a singularity, with the gravitational noise sufficient to hide Verpine grav-bikes from detection."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
