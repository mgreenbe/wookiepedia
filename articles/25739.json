It arrived at Red Claw's location posing as the first of corvette group Chemeti, saying the second had been \"delayed\", as part of a ruse to pick up pirate prisoners and a TIE Defender scientist. During the transfer operation it was under attack by Zaarin's own TIE Defenders, but the attack was a diversion, and after it was repelled the corvette went into hyperspace. Soon after the real corvettes arrived. It was only by that time that the Imperials realized that they had been deceived."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
