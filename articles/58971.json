However, Ke outlined multiple strategies for minimizing any negative effects the ability to reproduce might have on the army, which primarily consisted of training regimines and limiting contact with non-clones."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Understanding Humans"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 27 BBY, Hali Ke was the senior research geneticist of the cloning facilities on the Wild Space planet Kamino. During this time, Ke penned an internal memorandum that outlined the results of the Kaminoan's research on Jango Fett and of cloning Human subjects. This detailed Ke's extensive research on the society, mentality, and physiology of Humans, which included interviews on a diverse range of subjects, including those performed with a pirate hailing from the Fair Hollis system as well as Kardavan penitents devoted to helping other beings. Ke contrasted the wide range of mental constructs Humans portrayed, noting that the members of the species were capable of an extraordinarily wide range of ethical and moral diversity, with notable extremes on both ends of the spectrum. Ke concluded that Humans dominated the galaxy due to their extreme adaptability to become compatible with the wide range of environments they were found in."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Ke's research, the Kaminoan logged many interview sessions with Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett, who Ke felt embodied the contradictions Humans portrayed. Ke noted Fett's competency in his chosen profession, but was when Ke suggested that Fett lacked morality in a field primarily devoted to killing, the hunter vehemently disagreed. Ke observed Fett's distain for attachment, while at the same time having the ability to call upon a hundred mercenaries, Mandalorian and otherwise, to assist in the training of what would become the Galactic Republic's Grand Army. Although the Kaminoan noted that Fett cared little for the considerable sum of credits he received for his biological assistance in creating the clone army, Ke wrote that the hunter would gently play with his adopted son, Boba after returning from a violent hunt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ke continued the memorandum, citing the differences between Fett and his clones that would be introduced. These qualities mentioned by the genetisist included higher lung capacity, increased fast-twitch musculature, improved stamina and recovery times, and minor allergic reactions and astigmatism. The clones were also produced to be more docile and inclined towards team identity, although some of Fett's independence was still expected to unavoidably surface, according to the Kaminoan."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone sterility"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ke's research continued to  the issue of engineered sterility in the clone army. Citing results from other Human clones engineered by Kamino, including projects for Tarshan Ring Excavations and the Lords of Purala IV, the Kaminoan genetisist concluded that the clones' ability to reproduce was in fact vital to their performance. Ke projected the unusual lack of sterility in the clones would be mitigated by channeling basic Human impulses towards unit cohesion and minimizing the army's contact with non-clones. Ke also suggested that bioengineered contingency planning should be implemented for behavioral modification, which the Kaminoan noted could be useful if further modification was requested by their employers. Ke concluded by stating that research would continue as the Kaminoan geneticists continued to work on a species Ke considered to be both fascinating and confounding."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hali Ke rose to the rank of senior research genetisist on Kamino, and was fascinated by the vast range of physiological and biological contrasts that the Human species portrayed.
