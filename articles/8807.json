A row of lethal spikes ran down its back and tail, and two large tusks jutted from its mouth. They scavenged for whatever little food they could find. It had a strong, painful bite and was known to bite unwary beings without provocation. There was a soft spot at the back of its neck, just between the head and body carapace. It may have been related to the borrat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During their stay at his restaurant, members of Delta and Omega Squads suspected Qibbu the Hutt of attempting to substitute armored rat for nerf steak."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
