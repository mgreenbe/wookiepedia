Populations of wild fenwolves developed on a number of planets where they had escaped from their handlers, so Imperial sensor officers would not necessarily be surprised to find them on almost any planet where they were stationed. As a result, fenwolves were often used as mounts by Rebel scouts, as there was less than a fifty percent chance an Imperial, if somewhat lazy, would send a patrol to investigate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
