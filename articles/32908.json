A number of DL-21 pistols were used by Rebel forces during the invasion of Hoth in 3 ABY, and at the Battle of Endor a year later in the hands of Lieutenant Renz. Dengar was seen with a holstered DL-21 onboard the Executor. Ponda Baba also carried a modified DL-21 during his partnership with Cornelius Evazan. This particular blaster lacked a safety mechanism, and included cooling vents on the flared muzzle, and a comfortable hand grip suitable for Aqualish hands."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The DL-21 prop is a combination of the body of an AR-7 Explorer made by Charter Arms and a Sterling L2A3 submachine gun grip.
