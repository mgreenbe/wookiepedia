Behot, a citrus-flavored herb, was a popular choice for making shig, and was often used as a natural relaxant. Shig brewed from the behot herbs possessed an amber coloring, and retained the plant's citrus flavor. Some Mandalorians enjoyed splicing their shig by adding a touch of tihaar, a powerful alcoholic spirit Mandalorians distilled from fruit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While pregnant with her son Venku, Jedi Knight Etain Tur-Mukan found a cup of shig soothing to her stomach, and her adopted Mandalorian father, Kal Skirata, enjoyed a mug of shig to calm his nerves. Cantinas along Chortav Meshurkaane in Keldabe sold mugs of shig, and the native anti-Imperial resistance fighters of Toprawa brewed their own shig from locally grown behot herbs by the end of the Clone Wars. While working with the resistance on Toprawa, the Jedi Knight-in-hiding Jax Pavan came to develop a taste for the hot beverage, and drank shig often during his time on the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shig was first introduced to the Star Wars universe in the 2006 Star Wars Insider article, The Mandalorians: People and Culture, by Republic and Imperial Commando series author, Karen Traviss.
