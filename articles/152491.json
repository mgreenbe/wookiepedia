The Dug was on monitoring duties checking sectors of the star system when an Emergence occurred, and subsequently alerted the satellite's captain. The Dug began to state what they thought the crew should do, but after the captain ordered the initiation of planetary evacuation procedures and for Starlight Beacon to be activated, the Dug added a plea to get them out of there. The Dug had grey skin, white hair and yellow eyes, and wore a light grey-and-blue uniform with blue gloves and blue-and-red beads on their hair."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Dug first appeared in the 2021 comic book The High Republic Adventures 1."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
