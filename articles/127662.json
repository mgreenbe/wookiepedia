However she was not inducted into the Jedi Order, for she was abducted from Umbara by a tattooed Zabrak assassin named Darth Maul and imprisoned for months in an ancient tomb somewhere in the Cron Drift. While imprisoned, she was mentally and spiritually assaulted by long-dead Sith Lords on a daily basis and only her natural strength of will kept her from going completely insane. After surviving such rigorous trials, the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious rescued the girl from the tomb and nursed her back to health."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Known to the Umbaran girl as Senator Palpatine from Naboo, Sidious cared for the girl and educated her in politics, forming a close bond over the years. The trust between Moore and Sidious was so strong, the Sith Lord revealed his own Force-sensitivity and his true identity as a Sith. Over time, Sidious let Moore in on the Sith Grand Plan to bring peace to the galaxy and topple the Jedi Order. Vowing eternal loyalty, Moore went on to become one of Senator Palpatine's most trusted aides in the Galactic Senate and followed him from his days as Senator to the time he was elected Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Chancellor's advisor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Vote of No Confidence in Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum, Moore was rumored to have blackmailed Valorum's Staff Aide Sei Taria into resigning so that she herself could take the position as Palpatine ascended to the Office of the Supreme Chancellor.

Sidious even made use of the natural mind-clouding abilities of her species by having her impersonate his alter-ego Darth Sidious to force disloyal pawns into line. As the war dragged on, Sly Moore came under scrutiny by the Jedi High Council; the Jedi Order's leadership correctly suspected that the mysterious Darth Sidious had infiltrated the highest levels of the government. Before the High Council could complete the investigation, however, Chancellor Palpatine eradicated the Order and transformed the Republic into the first Galactic Empire.

Gossipvids and tabloid news spread scurrilous rumors that she and Emperor Palpatine had a relationship, noting the case of other Imperial concubines like Roganda Ismaren.

Torturing the captives and pitting them against one another, Moore and Sarcev Quest attempted to convert the acolytes of the Jedi Order into slaves of the dark side of the Force. Moore thrived during the first year of the Empire, developing a cold rivalry with the jealous Grand Inquisitor Malorum as the man climbed through the ranks of the Inquisitorius; Malorum often wondered why lesser beings attained the ranks he desired, pondering on Moore's presence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moore also supervised a pair of Shi'ido scientists, Mammon Hoole and Borborygmus Gog, as they conducted experiments in abiogenesis \u2014 the spontaneous generation of life. To that end, Moore provided them with a female Bordali Human named Niobi as a test subject. The result was Trioculus, a three-eyed mutant Human. Sly Moore made a great impression on the young Trioculus, and though he was banished to the spice mines of Kessel by Sarcev Quest, he never forgot the \"Queen of the Empire\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Moore herself had also come into the possession of Force-sensitive DNA from an undisclosed source and was deeply interested in a technique once perfected by Palpatine's Sith master Darth Plagueis: influencing the midi-chlorians to create a zygote in a fertile female. Moore abruptly disappeared from the Imperial Court shortly after a New Year Fete Week celebration, where whispers spread of her \"delicate\" condition. Rumors persisted that Moore had impregnated herself with the DNA and retired to her native Ghost Nebula, where she died giving birth to Triclops, the three-eyed, mutant \"Son of Palpatine\".
