When Cathar capitulated, her parents fled the planet among the very last remnants of their race, taking their child with them; they fled as far as they were able, and eventually settled on Taris. It was there that Juhani, only a few months old, was raised; throughout her life, she called Taris her homeworld. Like many non-Humans on Taris, at that point in its history, Juhani's family had a rough life. The native Humans disliked them merely for being \"aliens,\" looked at them in disgust, persecuted them, and charged them more for food than their own species. Juhani had mixed feelings for the planet she had to live on; she hated it, called it a \"rat-hole\" and a \"warren,\" but still felt that it was her home and that her life could have been far, far worse."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3963 BBY, the Mandalorians finally entered Republic space, and Taris fell under siege. Xor, a Twi'lek who had fought with the Mandalorians on Cathar, provoked Juhani's father into a fight and killed him. Her mother escaped with Juhani, but with the death of her mate something began to slowly die within her as well. She worked as hard as she could, but still didn't earn enough money to support both herself and her daughter. So she started borrowing money from the Exchange, doing everything possible to save funds, and giving Juhani most of their food. She began to waste away, until one day she collapsed in the cantina she worked in and never recovered, as they simply did not have enough money to pay a doctor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Exchange was the major supplier of slaves on Taris, and when her mother died they charged Juhani with her mother's debts and enslaved her, as she had no way to repay them. This was the worst period in her life. She was bound like a beast and treated like livestock, until she was released by a Jedi before she could be sold to her father's murderer, who was going to purchase her at auction. Juhani never gave up hope for a better life, however. She had heard tales about the Jedi, and had somewhat idealized their image as \"champions of truth, defenders of justice, heroes of the Republic.\" When she was freed from the slavers by Revan, who came to fight the Mandalorians with his group of Jedi, he and those Jedi lived up to everything her imagination had created them to be. Encouraged to join the Order by a human woman who followed Revan, Juhani vowed to become a Jedi.

Sometimes she doubted her place among the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dak Vesser had joined the Order at the same time as Juhani and become her friend. She expressed her doubts about the Order to him, and his were even stronger; he thought the Order was too controlling and limiting.

Quatra had nothing left to teach her, but Juhani had yet to learn to accept her own limits, so it was her choice to test Juhani in an unusual way. Quatra allowed Juhani to give in to her rage and strike her down in the middle of a fierce confrontation, leaving Quatra greatly injured and feigning death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Believing that she had harnessed the power of the dark side and killed her Master, Juhani left the Enclave and hid in the Ancient Grove where Jedi used to meditate.

Later on, Bastila Shan was key figure in the capture of Darth Revan, and Revan was said to have died. In truth, the greatly injured Revan had been brought to the Council, where the Jedi created a new identity for him through the Force. It was believed that Shan could draw on his subconscious memories to lead them to the Star Forge, the seat of power of the former Dark Lord. His new identity as a Republic soldier did not yet know the ways of the Force; thus, after the Sith set an ambush for Shan over Taris and eventually destroyed the planet in their attempt to prevent her escape, Shan brought the amnesiac soldier to Dantooine to begin his own Jedi trials. His last test before becoming a Padawan was given to him by Belaya's master, Zhar Lestin, who told the student that he must confront the source of the darkness tainting the grove and stop the threat there without assistance from other Jedi at the academy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Revan approached the grove, Juhani sensed his power but did not believe he could match her own, and she engaged him in battle.

She felt foolish to have thought she could harm a Master such as Quatra. Though she still bore the scars of her slip to the dark side, she trusted her Master's wisdom and now truly understood what she was meant to learn: humility. Quatra's lesson was that even one who was true to the teachings of the Jedi may just as easily fall to the dark side through their inability to understand or accept their own limitations. With this final trial passed, Juhani was promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Revan and Shan uncovered the Star Map in the Rakatan Ruins of Dantooine and were appointed the quest to find the Star Forge, Juhani asked the Council for permission to accompany the Padawan.

When she revealed her homeworld had been Taris, she lashed out at him in anger and blamed him for its destruction, but then calmed herself with the Jedi Code.

She confessed to her friend that she had been inspired by the Jedi hero who became Darth Revan, neither knowing that she was speaking to the one who had once been that man."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the crew was captured by Saul Karath on his flagship, the Leviathan , Revan learned the real reason for his visions and lost memories as Malak dueled him and taunted him with the revelation. Malak's words were confirmed by Bastila Shan before the Sith Lord captured her. Afterward, Revan revealed the shocking truth of his identity to Juhani and the crew. Juhani expressed her strong opinion that Revan, the man who had rescued her from slavery, could never have fully turned to the dark side.

Little did she know that her vow would be put to the test."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While traveling in search of the Star Maps, Juhani encountered Xor, the Twi'lek slaver who had tried to purchase her on Taris during the Mandalorian Wars. The slaver tried once again by making an offer to Revan. Revan stood by her, saying she was her own person; Juhani lashed out at Xor as he spoke of how he wiped out her people on Cathar and killed her father on Taris, but she did not give in to her anger.

Xor promised he would be back."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Confronting the dark side"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The second time Revan and Juhani encountered Xor, he brought two of his enforcers with him. After Revan and Juhani beat Xor and his thugs, Xor used his last moments attempting to feed her hatred, seeking the satisfaction of showing Juhani she was no better than him by provoking her into killing a defenseless opponent. He related the burning of the people of Cathar in their homes by his hand and the pleasure he took from it. With Revan's support, Juhani was able to leave Xor to his inevitable fate. Juhani regretted that he did not die by her hand, but it was more important that she resisted the dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Revan had collected the five Star Maps he needed to locate the Star Forge, the Ebon Hawk approached the space station, but the station's disruptor field damaged their hyperdrive. The ship barely made it to the nearby planet Lehon without joining the wreckage that covered the surface. Juhani suggested they search the other downed ships for the parts the Ebon Hawk needed to take off, though the disruptor field still needed to be deactivated. The possible whereabouts of its generator was found by the droid T3-M4, which detected energy readings on the ship's sensors that seemed to be coming from the Temple of the Ancients. The Elders granted Revan access to the temple, but tradition had it he should go alone; however, when both Juhani and Jolee Bindo received a premonition warning them of great danger laying inside, they insisted on accompanying Revan and struggled to persuade the Rakata to allow them to. It turned out to be the right decision, as the temple was infested with numerous Dark Jedi, Sith Masters, and acolytes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Atop the Rakatan temple, the Jedi trio was confronted by Bastila, who had been tortured and turned to the dark side by Darth Malak. When she found herself at a disadvantage, the fallen Jedi attempted to lure Revan into reclaiming his usurped title of Dark Lord of the Sith. Though Bastila mocked Juhani for running like a \"cowering animal\" when she first touched the dark side, Juhani had grown stronger through her friendship with the man who had once saved her on Taris; his inspiration helped keep her from falling to the dark side again.

Juhani's Master, Quatra, feared that her unchecked perfectionist views would eventually end in frustration and lead Juhani to the dark side. Quatra's final test forced Juhani to re-examine herself and how her pride had nearly made her fall to the dark side, the act would leave a positive impression that served as an example when she needed to reflect on her choices. Juhani claimed that Cathar were solitary and slow to trust by nature, so even when she eventually joined the Jedi she mostly kept to herself, keeping only a small circle of friends, including fellow Padawans Belaya and Dak Vesser. Even with Revan and the crew of the Ebon Hawk she kept herself at a distance, though she valued their companionship. Juhani was often a zealous advocate of the light side and the ways of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Juhani understandably held a grudge against the Mandalorians for Cassus Fett's unprovoked genocide on her birth planet of Cathar, and even though she recognized her Mandalorian ally Canderous Ordo as a person of merit, she could never fully trust him. In addition, she still harbored some animosity towards Humans for the prejudice and persecution she and her parents suffered while living on Taris. While she admitted that some of the best people she had ever known were human, she found it difficult to let go of her bitterness, and at times would even lash out emotionally at Revan for it.

As a member of a Cathar subspecies, she had less prominent claws than other Cathar and the ability to quickly alter the pigments in her fur, a natural camouflage that was enhanced when she instinctively learned how to conceal herself with the power of Force camouflage. As a Jedi Guardian, she preferred lightsaber combat, although she would also use several Force powers while in battle.

A gay man himself, he had never suggested a same-gender romance option because he believed fellow developers and audiences would not accept the idea.

Her Databank entry on StarWars.com also contained errors, such as stating that she was a romance option for player characters regardless of gender and that she had killed Quatra.

More persistent rumors speculated that BioWare or Lucasfilm had objected to Juhani having a female romance and ordered it to be eliminated or toned down.
