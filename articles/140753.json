Powerful and skilled, Xesh excelled as a warrior, though his friendship with a fellow slave named Trill became a bitter rivalry when the two became Force Hounds.

These machines and the pain that they caused also effectively stripped Xesh of his empathy, leaving him unable to experience emotions such as love or compassion. One of the Rakata, a Predor named Tul'kar sensed Xesh's power and singled him out from the brood, training him as a Force Hound. Not long afterwards, Tul'kar forced him to fight Trill, who was also training as a Force Hound, and the two battled aboard Tul'kar's ship Devourer. Xesh was victorious in their battle, and he was ordered by Tul'kar to strike down Trill with his new Forcesaber. However, in an effort to save Trill's life, Xesh proposed that Tul'kar present Trill as a gift to his superior, Skal'nas, as a gift\u2014but also an insult, as Trill would be less powerful than Xesh.

Among Xesh's discoveries was the planet Sriluur, which was inhabited by the Weequay species. Xesh led the Flesh Raiders, mutated lower-caste Rakata who were bred as soldiers for the Empire, in many battles, including one where they conquered the Givin species. In 25,793 BBY, Xesh located the planet of Tatooine, and he led Tul'kar's forces there to conquer it and the native Kumumgah.

Xesh replied by throwing her with the Force before leaping and attempting to kick her, and his second kick sent her falling to the floor.

At the same time, Xesh unknowingly appeared in visions to four people\u2014Sek'nos Rath, Shae Koda, and Tasha Ryo, and Daegen Lok. Koda, Rath, and Ryo were Je'daii Journeyers, students of the Force in the Je'daii Order on Tython, and Lok was an insane Je'daii who had been exiled to the moon Bogan.

Xesh scored a grazing blow on Koda's arm, but Ryo stopped him with the Force and again asked him to surrender. Refusing, Xesh threw Ryo against a nearby rock and resumed his battle with Koda and Rath, and the Sith was astonished when Xesh absorbed the ball of Force lightning that Rath cast at his opponent. Growing tired with the duel, Xesh unleashed the absorbed energy against Koda and Rath, and the lightning injured Koda's pet rancor Butch. Xesh took advantage of her distraction to send her flying with the Force, but Rath managed to stop Xesh's attack with his Forcesaber and take the weapon from the Force Hound.

Smashing his fist into the ground, Xesh used the Force to tear the surrounding rocks apart before fleeing into the nearby canyon known as the Rift. However, Xesh was weakened by his wounds and concussion, and he collapsed, unconscious, while traveling through the section of the Rift known as the Abyss of Ruh. Xesh's presence on Tython also generated an immense Force storm, as his intense darkness had driven the planet out of balance, and the storm became centered on Xesh's unconscious body in the Rift."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xesh's unconscious mind recalled the events on the Devourer, but the screams of the dying in his head awoke the Force Hound, who found that he was being encased in a cocoon of webbing by a swarm of spiders.

Battling through the nightmares and the twisted creatures that pursued him, Xesh found that his lightning had no effect on the beasts that attacked him, causing his mind to flash back to the fight with Isk years earlier and how Force Hounds were trained to fight on and with any weapon when the stakes were conquer or die. In the absence of his lighting, Xesh resorted to telekinesis, but when one of the creatures bit his arm, Xesh fell to the ground in pain\u2014only to grab spines off of a nearby plant and use them as projectile, felling all but one of the attacking creatures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the beast was plucked off of Xesh by a saarl, an enormous worm-like creature that proceeded to attack Xesh after it ate the smaller creature.

The two held back the saarl with the Force as it attacked them, but Xesh slipped away while the three Je'daii were distracted in battle, believing that the three had only saved him because they sought to kill the Force Hound himself. Xesh stopped his ascension of the nearby cliffs to savor the Je'daii's fear, but Koda's anger drew his attention as she struggled to activate the Forcesaber. Xesh called for her to give him the weapon, and despite her reservations, she tossed him the blade\u2014only for Xesh to walk away from their fight with his weapon. Xesh did not leave, however, but remained hidden at the top of the cliffs while he observed the Je'daii fight with the saarl.

An enraged Shae Koda, believing her master Quan-Jang to now be dead, grabbed Xesh's fallen Forcesaber and prepared to execute Xesh in her anger, but when Xesh informed Koda that she should have the honor portion of his body because of her bravery, Xesh's words confused Koda and brought her to her senses, causing her to deactivate the weapon and walk away.

Xesh found his own robes turned upon him as they tried to smother him, and reality seemed to twist so that there was no air.

The stranger grinned and explained that it was a mind twist\u2014he was inside Xesh's head\u2014and he was pleased when Xesh attacked him, as he wanted to see the Force Hound's power. Xesh pinned the man against the wall and summoned lightning to his hand to kill the man, but Xesh lowered his hand when the stranger asked why the warrior had appeared to him two months ago.

Rath refused to retreat and attacked Xesh, instigating a brief fight that ended when Lok threw a still mind-twisted Bel Zana off the nearby cliff and Rath leapt to save her.
