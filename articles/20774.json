When his youngest son died, Lar left Gryphon, realizing that the planet could never attain peace. He made his way to the peaceful planet of Alderaan, hoping to eke out a new life. When the Alderaanians heard of his plight, they welcomed him as a citizen, and he found work on the freighter Martika. Upon returning from a job, however, he found that Alderaan had been destroyed by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's Death Star. Lar declared that he would hunt down Tarkin's bloodline, and not rest until they were all eradicated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Brock Lar was a male member of a humanoid species, who hailed from the planet Gryphon, a mountainous world located in the Inner Rim. At some point, he sired several sons. War among the clans of Gryphon was the regular way of life, and Lar was the highest ranking warrior in his respective clan. When his youngest son was killed during the wars, however, he realized that peace on Gryphon was impossible. Gathering his family, he decided to move away from the certain death that Gryphon held for him, and departed his homeworld, hoping to seek out a more peaceful planet so that his family could start a new life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lar and his family made their way to the Core World of Alderaan where he regaled the natives with his life story. The Alderaanians welcomed Lar and his family, accepting them with open arms. Lar found work as the first mate on the cargo ship Martika, and he was able to eke out an entirely new existence. He later embarked on a long shipping job, and returned home to Alderaan, only to find that the planet had been completely obliterated by the Galactic Empire's Death Star, merely to demonstrate the battle station's full destructive power. With his family killed in the explosion, Lar reverted to his warring ways, and vowed to hunt down and destroy the bloodline of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, the man who had ordered Alderaan's destruction. He resolved to never sway from his self-adopted task until all of Tarkin's blood relatives had been destroyed. Although the Grand Moff had perished at the Battle of Yavin that had claimed the Death Star, Rivoche Tarkin, Wilhuff's niece, was still alive at the time, as was his widow, Thalassa, Lady Tarkin. At some point, Lar battled Tusken Raiders on Tatooine, and held an Imperial officer at knifepoint. He also joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic, which was waging the Galactic Civil War against the Empire at the time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The death of Brock Lar's youngest son made him come to terms with the fact that the clans of Gryphon had no hope for peace. The incident led him to emigrate from his homeworld entirely. Although he was able to find a new career beyond warfare, he reverted to his violent ways when the rest of his family was killed. In Lar's estimation, vengeance was a thing to be savored. Lar had white skin, with gray patches, and boasted red eyes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For attire, Brock Lar wore a green hood, which was part of a torn tunic, the left sleeve of which was all that remained. He wore a gauntlet on his left hand, but his right arm and hand was left bare. Slung across his back was a backpack, as well as a blaster rifle. Lar also kept a blaster pistol slung at his hip, the butt of which was attached to a guard on his thigh by a chain. He also boasted a breathing mask, and a combat knife, as well as a gaderffii."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character of Brock Lar was created by Matthew Berry and Craig Farr, two 18-year-old Star Wars fans who entered Star Wars Galaxy's \"Design An Alien\" competition, which was launched in Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 3 (1995). The competition called on readers to create entirely original aliens inspired and influenced by what was displayed in the original trilogy of Star Wars films. While Berry provided the pencils for the final artwork, Farr performed the coloring duties. Although Berry's and Farr's creation was not selected as one of the winners published in Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 7 (1996), they were later published under the \"honorable mentions\" section in Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 8. Leland Chee, the keeper of the Holocron continuity database, later confirmed that published material from the \"Design an Alien\" contest is considered canon. Although the character of Brock Lar has not been referenced directly in any other Star Wars material, the planet of Gryphon, which was created in Berry's and Farr's entry, was included in The Essential Atlas (2009), which was written by Daniel Wallace and Jason Fry."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
