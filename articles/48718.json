Intended as an influential and charismatic figure, the First Senator would have replaced the position of Chancellor and would have been tasked with bringing order to the divided government. The role of First Senator was proposed by Lady Carise Sindian, a Centrist, who wished to have a unifying figure who could break the impasse in the Galactic Senate between the Populists and Centrists. Populist Senator Leia Organa was considered a prime candidate by many for this position, until the true nature of her parentage was exposed by Centrist Senator Ransolm Casterfo. After her withdrawal from the role, Senator Tai-Lin Garr ran as the new Populist candidate, but he was assassinated. Following his assassination, both parties agreed that the election for First Senator should be postponed indefinitely."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
