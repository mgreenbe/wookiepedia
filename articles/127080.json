The main idea in mind for the design was to stay concealed while gathering information over a planet, to avoid hostile reactions from unknown lifeforms or primitive cultures. The SkyBlind used both sensor jammers and visually cloaking optical shields to conceal itself. To a casual observer on the ground, a SkyBlind would appear as a discoloration in atmosphere that would be easily confused with natural phenomena."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship included a repulsorlift module for closer inspection and landing on small spots. This landing sphere could carry all the mission crew along with 5 metric tons of cargo, and like the main Skyblind body, it had cloaking capability. Not all SkyBlinds carried a landing sphere; if no landing sphere was docked aboard, the SkyBlind's cargo space doubled."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
