During the Galactic Civil War, some time after the Battle of Yavin, a massive volcano eruption devastated the planet's surface and quickly overran the capital city. The Imperial Star Destroyer Devastator was sent to the planet to evacuate the remaining Imperial troops. Lieutenant Commander Ciena Ree also managed to evacuate forty civilians despite receiving no orders to do so. It took years before the sky became visible again due to the volcanic pollution. Ivarujar had distinct food palate, and meals such as spicy noodles could be purchased on Hosnian Prime."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
