During the Conquest of Makeb in 3638 BBY she coordinates the evacuation of refugees from the collapsing Makeb mesas. However, many of her efforts were undone by the InterStellar Regulators based on the Frinn Mesa, who used heavy artillery to bring the transports full of refugees down. After losing Banlon, Daskarta asked a Republic strike team to storm the Regulators' fortress and disable the artillery."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
