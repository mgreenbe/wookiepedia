After the Wrath had acquired both objects, Madaga-Ru appeared before the Sith Warrior as a ghostly apparition, insisting on possessing the Wrath briefly as compensation for his assistance, regardless of consent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Wrath had freed the Voice, Madaga-Ru appeared before the Sith warrior as an apparition, revealing that he gained the knowledge needed to keep Sel-Makor from escaping his prison, as well as warning that one person among the Wrath's crew was a traitor, but was unable to say their name.
