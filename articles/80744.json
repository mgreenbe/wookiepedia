He gives her access codes to the Mynock, and tells her to give them to Syn and Deliah when they come in. He also meets Chak and Kee, who are looking for Syn and Blue, who both borrowed th Grinning Liar before the were captured by Rav and the Imperials. He then leaves and finds his way to the Sith Temple, where he makes his way to the chamber that Hosk Trey'lis is being held in. He learns that Hosk has told the Sith everything he knew about Cade.
