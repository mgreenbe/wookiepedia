Around the time of the Hosnian Cataclysm, when Toben was still a child, the nomads came across the remains of the New Republic corvette Starlight Wanderer, which had crashed during the Battle of Jakku many years earlier. The nomads accessed the corvette's computer and Toben found the captain's log. The nomads reviewed the log noted that it revealed that something valuable had been captured by Captain Telanasi, the commanding officer of the Starlight Wanderer, was hidden inside a vault somewhere in the ship, and they set about trying to find it.
