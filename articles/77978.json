Those pearls were exceedingly rare and valuable. The former senator Johhar Kessen, a notorious big game hunter, regarded a polished krayt dragon pearl paperweight as the ultimate trophy on Tatooine. In 9 ABY, a group of Tusken Raiders found a pearl in the corpse of a greater krayt dragon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Krayt dragons had a very long lifespan, and during the course of their life, would ingest stones to assist in digestion. The corrosive digestive fluid would break down and eventually dissolve the rocks. Rarely, a stone would contain a kyber crystal that would remain in a beast's gut being refined over the life of the dragon until it formed a smooth sphere. These pearls could vary in size from palm-sized to larger than a humanoid's head. Because the pearls were formed from kyber, they could be used in lightsabers. A lightsaber equipped with one of these pearls emitted a very powerful and destructive blade that emitted a howling sound when ignited."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
