They lived in unit 2-A of a residential building they shared with the Sharlson family, the Kinalos family, and \"Old Man\" Hamedaw. In the aftermath of the Second Battle of Coruscant and the Imperial Civil War in 10 ABY, much of Coruscant was laid waste and the Sigus' home was badly burned. Returning to his ruined home with the New Republic Army, their old neighbor Kinalos did not believe that the Sigus family had survived."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
