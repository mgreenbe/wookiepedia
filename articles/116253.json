During her term as senator, the Pantoran Assembly requested that the Grand Army of the Republic establish a base on Orto Plutonia to protect the moon of Pantora from possible violent overtures from the belligerent Confederacy of Independent Systems. Although the Republic's armed forces complied, their station on Orto Plutonia soon ceased communications, forcing military leaders and Chairman Chi Cho of the Pantoran Assembly to organize an investigative task force to send to the frozen world. Cho asked that Chuchi accompany him with Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi to Orto Plutonia to act as a liaison between the Pantoran government and the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Chuchi was on Orto Plutonia, her responsibilities as a senator were marginalized by Cho, who simply used her as a mouthpiece to convey his orders to the two Jedi. It was eventually discovered that Orto Plutonia was indeed inhabited and that its Talz population was the cause of the communications disruption. Chairman Cho held a great disdain for the Talz and attempted to wipe out the Plutonian tribe, but was instead killed in the process. Chuchi was able to negotiate peace between the Pantoran government and the Talz of Orto Plutonia before she eventually returned to the Republic's capital of Coruscant to resume her senatorial duties. Later in the war, Pantora was blockaded by the Trade Federation megaconglomerate under the pretense that the planet owed a number of debts to the corporation. During the crisis, the daughters of the newly-elected Pantoran Chairman, Notluwiski Papanoida were kidnapped by bounty hunters working on behalf of Federation representatives who were interested in pushing Papanoida to ally his world with the Confederacy of Independent Systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chuchi took it upon herself to find the chairman's missing daughters with the aid of her close friend, Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano. The two visited the Trade Federation vessel in orbit of Pantora to search for the kidnapped Papanoidas but were only successful in finding Chi Eekway Papanoida. However, they did overhear a conversation that confirmed that Trade Federation supervisor Sib Canay had planned the blockade and kidnappings on behalf of the Confederacy, successfully using that information to bring an end to Pantora's commercial isolation. Chuchi continued to serve Pantora during the Clone Wars, surviving an assassination attempt by the sniper Shonn Volta and being one of the greatest proponents of a peaceful end to the war."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early career with Chi Cho"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Problems with a protectorate"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Riyo Chuchi, who had no previous field experience in personal negotiations, was far more of an idealist than her fellow Pantoran, Chairman Chi Cho, who had requested Republic protection from the Separatists, resulting in the establishment of Glid Station, an outpost on Pantora's protectorate world of Orto Plutonia. However, the Pantorans did not know that Orto Plutonia already was populated by a native tribe of Talz. When Glid Station suddenly dropped out of contact, the paranoid Cho assumed Separatists were staging an attack on Pantora and tagged along with the Jedi mission to investigate the case, led by Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. He brought Riyo Chuchi with them so that he could exert influence over the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "War on Orto Plutonia"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Pantorans discovered the Talz, it seemed that their claim to Orto Plutonia was nullified and the Talz would be recognized as sovereign. But Cho refused to accept that, not wanting to lose the protection of an advanced base. Initially, he tried claiming the Talz were non-sentient to invalidate their claim of sovereignty. When that bid failed, he declared war on the primitives, framing it as a purely local affair, beyond the scope of Chuchi or the Jedi's influence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Riyo Chuchi was stuck for a solution but Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi suggested she contact the Pantoran Assembly for assistance. After she spoke with the Assembly and explained Cho's behavior, the Assembly declared Cho out of order and gave Senator Chuchi the authority she needed to settle the dispute. By that time, the Pantorans and the Talz had already gone to war. Blood was spilled on both sides and Cho himself was fatally wounded by a Talz spear. His dying wish was for Chuchi to continue the battle so that Orto Plutonia would remain a Pantoran possession. She refused and told him of the Assembly's decision. Cho died seconds later, dumbfounded he had been overruled. With Cho dead, Chuchi offered peace to the Talz chieftain Thi-Sen, something the Talz happily accepted. Chuchi pulled all Pantoran presence off of Orto Plutonia, leaving the Talz alone. Both Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi complemented her courage and Chuchi promised Kenobi that she would work to end all war."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Political Independence"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Work on Coruscant"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, during the Senate hostage crisis, Riyo Chuchi was one of the Senators taken hostage by bounty hunter Cad Bane and his team, who wanted to exchange their freedom for the release of Ziro the Hutt. During the incident, she helped Padm\u00e9 Amidala care for the wounded Skywalker by cradling the Jedi's head in her lap until he regained consciousness. When the Hutt crime lord was freed, Bane and his team set up explosive charges in the room the senators were held in before leaving the building. Bane used these charges as a insurance policy in case Chancellor Palpatine decided to take action against him. After threatening to destroy the entire east wing of the Senate Building along with the Senators if he was not allowed to leave, Palpatine had no choice but to let him pass. Once safely away, Bane detonated the charges, but Riyo Chuchi and other senators were saved by the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who managed to get them a safe distance away right before the explosion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She was later present in the Grand Convocation Chamber when Duchess Satine Kryze of Mandalore came to Coruscant to plead her case.

Chuchi went to the Senate to plead assistance before the Pantoran people decide to ally with the Separatists.\nHer arguments against the Federation representative Lott Dod over the issue of the blockade proved successful and accepted by the Senate. But afterwards, Chairman Notluwiski Papanoida's daughters were kidnapped by Greedo, to use as leverage to force Pantora into joining the Separatists. Chuchi teamed up with Anakin Skywalker's Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, whom she was friends with, to rescue Papanoida's family. They journeyed to the Federation ship, under the pretense of announcing a possible alliance between Pantora and the Separatists. While there, they secretly searched the ship in search of the girls. Hiding in the conference room, they overheard the Neimoidians discussing the Papanoidas. Chuchi nearly gave herself and Ahsoka away by gasping, though they are able to avoid being discovered. The two then begin a search of the prison blocks, unaware that they were being monitored. When they found Che Amanwe, who was separated from her sister, they were confronted by a group of Super battle droids and Administrator Sib Canay. Ahsoka was able to dispatch them all before the Neimoidian Gunnery Battalion and the Neimoidian envoy arrived. Chuchi stepped up to point out that the Trade Federation claims to have no involvement in the the kidnapping and yet Che was being held prisoner and implied that she may bring this matter to the Senate, blackmailing the Neimoidians into letting them leave. When they returned to Coruscant, Dod was forced to lift the blockade, which pleased the Papanoida family as well as Chuchi."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Danger in the Senate"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the dangerous Zillo Beast from Malastare rampaged through the Coruscant, it arrived at the Republic Executive Building.

Senator Amidala herself took to the Senate floor to appeal to her colleagues for more votes in support of the hotly debated bill.

When she first became a senator, she had a timid personality and submitted completely to Chairman Cho's more dominating air, attributable to her limited experience and implied age. By the time of the Blockade of Pantora she had become a stronger individual and was able to successfully blackmail a Trade Federation envoy into lifting the blockade.
