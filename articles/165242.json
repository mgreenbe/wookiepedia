An experiment by the Galactic Empire to create the perfect assassin, which was overseen by Commander Rezi Soresh. Soresh wiped the participants' identities from a computer database system and had their faces surgically altered. He then started his brutal reconditioning program, which was designed to turn them into mindless servants by removing their past memories and emotions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At first, X-4 became friends with X-1, X-2, X-3, X-5, X-6, and X-7, the other participants in the training program. However, after Soresh started torturing them with electrocution, X-4, like the others, had his personality and mind changed completely until he felt no emotions. About ten years prior to the Battle of Yavin, they were pitted against each other in combat until only one remained. X-4 committed suicide by hanging himself with a laser whip. X-7 later earned the right to become Soresh's personal assassin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "X-4's only appearance in Star Wars canon is in a flashback in Rebel Force: Target, the first book of the young readers series Star Wars: Rebel Force, published on December 2, 2008 and written by Alex Wheeler."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
