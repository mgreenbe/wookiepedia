After the Battle of Yavin, the young man got indebted to the spice smugglers Jaryn Minoze and Oret Sturm, two members of the ryll smuggling ring of the Chirq Council in Kor Vella. Civius Bain was forced to work for the smugglers in the Ryll Smuggler Base where they refined their ryll. Olivia Bain was desperate and wished for him to leave the smuggling ring and come home. Circa 1 ABY, she met a spacer in the Vella plains and begged to rescue her son. The spacer accepted and headed to the Ryll Smuggler Base. The spacer found Civius Bain in the bunker but the young man explained that he could not leave the smuggling ring since he was still indebted to the smugglers. The spacer therefore killed both Jaryn Minoze and Oret Sturm, allowing Civius to finally escape. After that, Civius Bain decided to start a new life and become an accountant like his father."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Olivia Bain was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
