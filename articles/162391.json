In 2 BBY, Han Solo tried to sneak up on J'uoch's mining camp, but he inadvertently triggered a sensor net. One of the W'iiri, being a trusted employee, was issued a grenade launcher and joined a response squad to attack Solo. The rest of the response squad was composed of two Humans and a Drall; all were forced to seek cover when Solo began firing on them with a Kell Mark II heavy assault rifle. The W'iiri and its companions later tried to work their way up the hill on which Solo was located under cover fire from their companions. Nevertheless, they were again forced back by the Human."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after, when the mining camp was attacked by remnants of Xim's Guardian Corps activated by Bollux, a droid companion of Solo, another three W'iiri worked together to attack one of the droids.

Shortly after their sacrifice, the remainder of the droids were defeated; however, not before they overran the camp."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The W'iiri were created by Brian Daley for Han Solo and the Lost Legacy, published by Del Rey in 1980.
