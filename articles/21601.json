He served in the Second Battle of Geonosis under the command of Jedi General Luminara Unduli, during which he and the general searched for the escaped Archduke Poggle the Lesser. After they tracked him down to the Progate Temple, Buzz found and removed the cover from a hole leading down to the Geonosian catacombs.

He was part of the 41st Elite Corps and was under the command of Commander Gree and Jedi General Luminara Unduli during the Second Battle of Geonosis around 22 BBY. Buzz participated in the attack on the Geonosis primary droid foundry to lure the droid forces from detecting Padawans Ahsoka Tano and Barriss Offee, who were secretly infiltrating the factory. After the Republic passed a tower, Geonosian warriors boxed the army in and, although Buzz managed to shoot down a number of them with his blaster cannon, the Confederacy's new super tanks began destroying their artillery and vehicles. Buzz, along with the rest of the 41st Elite Corps, Torrent Company, and the 212th Attack Battalion, began to retreat. Generals Skywalker and Unduli planted bombs underneath the bridge, destroying it and the super tanks. The factory was destroyed, and the following collapse of the droid facility caused the clone forces to retreat before the area became consumed in the debris cloud."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the droid factory was destroyed, General Unduli and Buzz tracked Poggle the Lesser on two BARC speeders. She contacted fellow Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Ki-Adi-Mundi regarding the situation. After Buzz discovered and analyzed a Geonosian munitions crate, Buzz was able to determine the route Poggle had taken and the two traveled through a sandstorm to the Progate Temple. There Buzz found a cover leading to the underground catacombs where both of them were soon attacked by undead Geonosians which resulted in Buzz's demise. General Luminara Unduli was later saved."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a clone of Jango Fett and like all other troopers Buzz stood at 1.83 meters.

His armor had green markings and on his helmet there were small tally marks indicating how many enemy droids he had taken out. During the march on the droid factory during the Second Battle of Geonosis, Buzz wielded a Z-6 rotary blaster cannon. After the factory was destroyed, Buzz used a standard DC-15S. Buzz could also use a speeder bike to a useful degree, specifically a BARC speeder."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Trivia & Details section of the Weapons Factory Episode Guide, another clone trooper present at the battle, Draa, is mistakenly credited with Buzz's line \"Buckle your belts and check your cells, soldiers.
