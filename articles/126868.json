Battle droids stationed at a hidden Separatist base on the planet, which was erroneously believed to be uninhabited, provoked a village of the native Talz. The garrison of Glid Station, a Galactic Republic military outpost built on Orto Plutonia at the behest of the inhabitants of the moon Pantora, was caught in the middle. The Talz wiped out the droids and clone troopers, leaving the droid heads and clone helmets on spears at the two bases as a warning against return."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After contact was lost with Glid Station, Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, accompanied by their clone forces and Pantoran dignitaries Chairman Chi Cho and Senator Riyo Chuchi, visited Orto Plutonia to investigate. The two Jedi discovered the Talz and learned the story of what had happened from chieftain Thi-Sen, but Cho sparked a battle between the Talz and his people due to his insistence on claiming Orto Plutonia as sovereign Pantoran territory and refusing to view the Talz as sentient beings. After Cho's subsequent death in battle, Chuchi was able to negotiate peace between the Pantorans and Talz, agreeing to leave Orto Plutonia to them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The skirmish on Orto Plutonia first appeared in a hologram recording in the episode \"Trespass.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
