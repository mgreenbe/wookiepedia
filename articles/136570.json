As the Imperial war machine began to grow, new resources were needed. Slavery was a key component to this buildup. Like the Wookiees of Kashyyyk, the native Mon Calamari and Quarren of Mon Calamari were viewed as ideal slaves. The world's massive shipyards and location near the Tion Cluster made it the perfect site for an Imperial base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mon Calamari attempted to negotiate a peaceful settlement with the Empire, but it was rejected.

However, several disgruntled Quarren sabotaged the planetary shields, opening the world to invasion. They were led by Seggor Tels, a Quarren leader motivated by hatred of the Mon Calamari.
