In its aftermath, Emergences of the debris began occurring across the Outer Rim Territories. When an Emergence occurred in the Trymant system, the Star Hopper was the only Jedi or Galactic Republic starship in range, and it was diverted to assist. With the class of apprentices assembled, Yoda had several of the students report what they had discovered on the situation, as hyperspace debris was hurtling towards Bralanak City, the most densely populated area of the planet Trymant IV. Buck told the class that he and Yoda would be handling the largest pieces of debris. He added that the Padawans' job was to help people on the ground to safety and deal with smaller chunks. The Padawans were then dispatched to their rescue speeders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While assisting civilians in the city, Padawan Lula Talisola and several of her friends attempted to commandeer a large Spider Cruiser which had arrived in the city so it could be used as an evacuation vehicle.

As Talisola, her best friends Farzala Tarabal and Qort, and Force-sensitive civilian Zeen Mrala, who had stepped in to telekinetically hold off a large chunk of debris, were surrounded by the pirates, Buck and Yoda arrived before the pirates could attempt to execute them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Torban Buck was a male Chagrian with blue skin. Lula Talisola thought that Buck was capable of remaining genuinely calm and collected during a crisis, and that he was not hiding any insecurities the way she was. However, he also possessed a touch of bombast that led him to utilize the nickname \"Buckets of Blood\" when announcing himself in certain situations, such as charging into combat. This occasionally discomfited people. As he was primarily a healer, Buck was wary about being left to safeguard the Padawans by himself during battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Torban Buck was skilled enough in the use of the Force that he had attained the rank of Jedi Master.
