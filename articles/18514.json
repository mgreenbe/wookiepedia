After Governor Pre Vizsla of Concordia was publicly exposed as the leader of Death Watch, the splinter group was exiled from the Mandalore system. In 19 BBY, Kryze and Vizsla discovered the Sith Lords Maul and Savage Opress.

Due to Mandalore's neutrality, Kenobi was forced to come alone, and he was captured by Maul, who then killed Satine. When Kenobi was brought to the prison, Kryze and her rebels freed the Jedi, and Mandalore was swept into a civil war as Maul's forces fought to reclaim him.

Less than a year later, Kryze's desire was fulfilled, and the Republic laid siege to Mandalore, driving Maul from the planet. She then became Lady of House Kryze and Regent of Mandalore.

When Djarin complained about Kryze changing their deal, Kryze taunted him by uttering the mantra \"This is the Way,\" telling him that if he wanted her information about the Jedi, he would help her take the ship. As they attempted to storm the bridge, they were pinned down by a force of stormtroopers and the Imperial captain began to alter the ship's course as to crash it and prevent a successful raid. However, to Kryze's surprise, Djarin charged them, absorbing many hits and throwing detonators that killed the last of the troopers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Djarin and Reeves realigned the ship's course, Kryze interrogated the captain about the location of the Darksaber. The captain sneered at her, saying that if she was asking then she already knew, before committing suicide through use of a suicide pill. Kryze was angry that she could not interrogate him further but was more pleased with the success of their mission. She offered Djarin a place among them despite the differences in their creeds, but Djarin declined, with Kryze telling him that her offer stood if he ever changed his mind. Keeping her word, she told the bounty hunter that he could find Ahsoka Tano in the city of Calodan on the planet Corvus.

Djarin and his companion Boba Fett approached Kryze and Reeves to ask for their help, but Kryze began to pick a fight with Fett, saying that he was a disgrace to his armor because he was not a Mandalorian. After Fett made threats, Kryze coldly stated that she had heard his voice thousands of times since he was a clone, and after Fett retorted, Reeves attacked him. Kryze broke up their scuffle and decided to accept Djarin's request when she learned that Djarin knew the location of Gideon and his light cruiser. She made Djarin promise that she take the Darksaber from Gideon, to which Djarin responded that his only priority was rescuing Grogu. She and Reeves joined Djarin's party, which included Fett, Fennec Shand, and Carasynthia Dune."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The group met and Kryze formed a plan to get them inside, using information from Doctor Pershing, who was their prisoner. Using a stolen Imperial shuttle, Kryze would lead Reeves, Dune, and Shand to the bridge while Djarin would slip away and rescue the child. Piloting the shuttle towards the cruiser, Kryze hailed the ship to request an emergency landing as Fett, piloting Slave I, pretended to attack them. Kryze's request was denied, but she nonetheless landed on the ship and stormed out with the others, killing large amounts of Imperial forces before taking the bridge. However, they failed to discover Gideon there. Kryze waited on the bridge with the others until Djarin arrived with Gideon in his custody."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Realizing that Djarin had defeated Gideon in combat, Kryze knew that the bounty hunter had unintentionally claimed the Darksaber as his own. As Gideon taunted Kryze, Djarin offered her the blade, but Kryze stiffly refused to take it in such a manner. Djarin attempted to yield, wishing to honor his previous agreement with Kryze and not wanting to cause a fight, but Kryze did not accept. Just then, Gideon's dark troopers, who Djarin had previously fought and ejected from the ship, boarded and advanced towards their position on the bridge.

Her haircut was reflective of traditional Mandalorian style of hard angled lines. She was born on Mandalore into House Kryze, and she was the sister of Duchess Satine, who nicknamed her \"Bo.\" Kryze was a member of Death Watch, and she believed in restoring Mandalore's traditional heritage, even at the expense of her sister's rule. In Death Watch, Kryze was confident and sardonic, serving as Vizsla's loyal lieutenant.

Kryze believed that the enemy of her enemy was her friend, so although she disliked the Jedi and Sith alike, Kryze joined forces with Kenobi after Maul killed Satine. The death of her sister overwhelmed Kryze with grief, showing she loved her sister despite any differences in ideals. She was determined to end Maul's rule of Mandalore, even if it required a Republic invasion.
