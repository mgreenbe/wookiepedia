They consisted of a long sleek body, which housed the single pilot in an open-air cockpit, and a pair of wings located above the body at the back of the vehicle.

While their own vehicles were refueling, the pair used the jet-wings to avoid the sensors of the Separatist craft leading and shielding the other Separatist vessels. They breached the ship's shields, landing the jet-wings on its surface and dismounting, after which the vehicles were destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jet-wings first appeared in Inside Job, a comic written by Rik Hoskin and illustrated by Andres Ponce that was published on November 12, 2009 as part of issue 6.1 of of the Star Wars Comic UK magazine series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
