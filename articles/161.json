The duo was mapping unexplored space near Rishi Maze using Rishi itself as their resupply point, when 08-RD was stolen and dismantled by the Nova Blades pirate gang. An individual overheard Ziril calling after 08 and retrieved broken pieces of the droid from the pirates. Ziril was thankful and started reassembling her companion, though she estimated the process to take at least two weeks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
