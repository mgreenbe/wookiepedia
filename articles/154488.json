The fleet's tattered remnants desperately sought sanctuary and new allies in their struggle against the Galactic Empire. During that time, a Human male commanded one of the Alliance Fleet's GR-75 medium transports."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rebel Alliance heroes Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia Organa, and Lando Calrissian arrived at the rendezvous point after escaping the Empire's seizure of Bespin's Cloud City, which saw their ally Han Solo captured by the bounty hunter Boba Fett. As Skywalker and Organa recovered from their travails aboard the medical frigate Redemption, Calrissian soon departed the fleet in the starship Millennium Falcon in search of Solo, ultimately planning to rendezvous with his comrades on the planet Tatooine. Yet it was mere hours after Calrissian's departure that an Imperial Strike-class cruiser happened upon the Alliance Fleet's position. Reporting to Organa from aboard his GR-75 medium transport, the Rebel commander announced that the fleet was diverting to intercept its hostile visitor."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Strike cruiser eliminated"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebel commander directed the ensuing skirmish, urgently tasking the X-wing starfighters of Rogue Squadron with eliminating the Imperial Strike cruiser before it could report the Alliance Fleet's position. By employing jamming measures, the fleet prevented the Strike cruiser from sending out a transmission even as the Imperial vessel dispatched a number of TIE fighters to meet Rogue Squadron. Both the commander's transport and the Rogues exchanged fire with the TIEs, quickly dispatching the enemy fighters but prompting the Strike cruiser to turn and flee. The Strike cruiser's decision to divert full power to its rear shields as it fled blocked pursuing fire from the commander's transport but merely left the rest of the ship vulnerable. Rogue Squadron exploited the opening and destroyed the Imperial Strike cruiser."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite their victory, the Rebels' secrecy had been compromised. The commander altered the fleet's course as a precaution, and the armada soon broke formation and headed back toward the galactic plane. Speaking to Organa aboard the Redemption via viewscreen, the commander explained that his decision might well delay the princess's plans to journey to Tatooine, but Organa understood that the fleet's safety was the top priority."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rebel commander had shaggy, light-brown hair; brown eyes; and light skin.
