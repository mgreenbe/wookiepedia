As such, she would notably remind the queen of her schedule for the day. In truth, Queen Breha regarded her as more than just an aide, but as a friend. Visaiya was so important to Organa that the queen often joked that losing her would be like cutting off a hand. As a symbol of their friendship, the two even had matching silver rings they each wore on their right index fingers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
