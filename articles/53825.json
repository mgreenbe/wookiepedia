Orbited by the moon Belsus, Gentes was once home to many clans of Ugnaughts until most of them were sold into slavery, leaving few remaining by the time of the Iron Blockade. During the blockade, slavers raided the homes of some of the remaining Ugnaughts, driving them to hide in their homeworld's swamps and send out a distress signal offering supplies to any who would aid them. One group of Ugnaughts wished to leave the planet and join the Alliance to Restore the Republic, so the Rebels made a quick evacuation of the new recruits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A young smuggler responded to the Ugnaught's distress signal by sending a crew member to help them, while also assisting the Rebels by defending their ship during the Ugnaughts' evacuation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gentes was first mentioned in Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin, a 1989 Star Wars Legends supplement written by Jonatha Ariadne Caspian for Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game.
