He accompanied his Master on many missions for the Jedi Council. He was known for being tentative, often worrying about his master, and for having a dislike of strange situations. Ar-Six has a domed R2-series head, typically R6-series astromechs had cone shaped heads similar to the R5-series. It is unknown why Ar-Six has this modification, possibly for use in Fisto's starfighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Ar-Six and Kit Fisto followed a Republic tracking beacon to Vassek, where they believed that Nute Gunray was hiding. Master Fisto landed his starfighter in the fog and ordered Ar-Six to stay put before he went to meet Nahdar Vebb and his clone troopers standing by a Nu-class attack shuttle. When the Jedi and the clones entered the nearby facility, two clones, Bel and Niner, stayed behind with R6."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the clones tracked Grievous' starfighter incoming, they reported to Commander Fil. Shortly afterward, Grievous' IG-100 MagnaGuards used a rocket launcher to destroy the shuttle with both clones inside it. When MagnaGuards surrounded the starfighter, Ar-Six received orders from Fisto to fly away, which he performed, shaking off a tenacious MagnaGuard who was clinging to the fighter's hull."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ar-Six would then circle the area until Fisto ordered Ar-Six to meet him at the nearest landing platform. Once Fisto reached the platform, however, he was confronted by Grievous and his MagnaGuards. At that point in time, Ar-Six arrived in the starfighter, allowing Kit to board it and escape the battle. The two then returned to Coruscant, where Fisto reported his former Padawan's death to the Jedi Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in the Clone Wars, Ar-Six assisted Kit Fisto, Adi Gallia, Saesee Tiin, and Plo Koon in rescuing Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Wilhuff Tarkin, and their clone troopers from a citadel. The rescue resulted in the disclosure of the Nexus Route, a hyperspace lane that led to the heart of both factions in the war."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although his dome seems to be of an R2 unit and not the typical, slightly conical \"flowerpot\" shape of the R6, if R6-H5 is indeed an R6-series astromech droid, and not just an earlier model with an \"R6\" designation, his inclusion poses a continuity problem, as R6 units had not been created until the later stages of the Galactic Civil War.\nAlternately, Pablo Hidalgo's revelation that droid names are fragments of longer designations could also provide an explanation for this apparent lack of continuity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Coincidentally enough, R6-H5 shares the \"H5\" with Kit Fisto's other droid, R4-H5."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "R6-H5 appears in LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars, in the Vassek scenario.
