Its first scope was a thermal scanner that was capable of detecting and enhancing life forms that generated heat. Its second scope was a sniper scope that automatically calculated range and adjusted the rifle's collimating components. Its third scope was a passive infrared scope that used heat imaging technology. It also rendered elements like rain, smoke, dust, and darkness transparent and it could transmit visual data to stormtrooper's optical sensors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although cumbersome compared with the BlasTech E-11, it was the preferred weapon of Imperial sandtroopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The early World War II-era German MG-15 machine gun provided the basis for this 'in universe' weapon. The MG-15, with its distinct saddle drum magazines, was used by Luftwaffe air crews for air defense during WWII.
