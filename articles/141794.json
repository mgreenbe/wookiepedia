The rebels particularly Sabine Wren were reluctant to rescue a second person until Hondo assured them that Terba knew secrets that were vital to the rebellion. During the escape attempt, Terba demanded a double share but was rebuffed by Hondo, who called him a \"greedy little pig.\" Snubbed, Terba broke free of the group and fled outside the prison only to be blasted to death by an Imperial AT-DP walker.
