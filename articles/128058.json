The unit shares its name with the aerial Dactillions of the planet Utapau. Early in the Galactic Civil War, Imperial defector Zal Artha was assigned to the squadron and within weeks was flying combat operations. Around 0 ABY, following an attrition raid on the Fondor Shipyards, the survivors were assigned to a base on the planet Cardooine. They were given prototype A-wings to fly. After a week, the base came under attack by Imperial forces, and although the Dactillions demonstrated the superb qualities of the A-wing, only two pilots, including Artha, survived the battle. During the battle they were assisted by the technician Tendaar Bel, who scrambled the Imperials' IFF codes. Artha then requested reassignment to Alliance Special Operations."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Soaring Dactillions squadron was mentioned in Zal Artha's Character Folio included with Fantasy Flight Games' 2014 roleplaying game Star Wars: Age of Rebellion Beginner Game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
