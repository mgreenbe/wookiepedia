It is a combination of the highly successful LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game and its sequel LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy. The game was released for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Nintendo DS on November 6, 2007. A PC version was released on October 13, 2009. The Mac version, published by Feral Interactive, was released on November 12, 2010. On November 12, 2013, LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga was one of the games to receive backwards compatibility from Xbox 360 to Xbox One. On December 12, 2013, the game was released for iPhone, published by Disney Interactive.  On February 19, 2016, the game was released for Android devices on Google Play, published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga gives a humorous look on the movies of both the prequel trilogy and the original trilogy. The game was developed by Traveller's Tales, who was also produced the other games in the series. LucasArts published the game as they did with LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy. It contains the levels and characters of the first two games, but has additional content for the levels. A total of 128 characters are available, as well as additional and expanded levels. The game does not delve too deeply into the plot of the saga; rather it gives a summary with some focus on important events, but in a humorous take. For instance, when Luke Skywalker gets his father's lightsaber from Obi-Wan Kenobi, he accidentally slices off C-3PO's head. The characters also do not speak, only making grunts and vocalizations. Sometimes this is used to comedic advantage, such as when Darth Vader reveals his true identity to his son (instead of saying \"No, I am your father\", he holds up a picture of him with Padm\u00e9 during Episode III), and instead of Princess Leia pleading with Moff Tarkin not to destroy Alderaan, she simply waves her hands in the air while vocalizing something along the lines of \"blah blah blah\"."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The levels originally found in LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game have content similar to those in LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy such as Power Bricks and vehicles. New game features include enhanced Force powers, new power-ups and a new Challenge Mode. The speeder chase level, originally removed from the first game, is a playable level, as well as a playable Zam Wesell. Much of the game revolves around collecting \"studs,\" small LEGO pieces that are used as an in-game currency."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to this, the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 versions include online co-operative play, allowing two players on different consoles to play the game; however single-console co-operative is also supported. The Playstation 3 version can also output to 1080i resolution. The Wii version does not have online or High Definition video output, instead using the motion-sensing capabilities of the console to drive vehicles and attack. For instance, to attack as a Jedi, the player can swing the remote much like the character would in the game."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the Wii, the game is graphically identical to how the original game and its sequel appeared on the Playstation 2 and Xbox. However on the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, the game has been given many graphical nuance upgrades, such as depth of field, blooming, bump mapping, higher texture resolution and more detailed models. For instance, the legs of the minifigures were square in the first two games, while in \"The Complete Saga\" their interiors are fully modeled. However, there have been no upgrades to the amount of things on screen. The Battle of the Grassy Plains scene, for example, is devoid of many objects."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the original LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game, the music for Episode III was not yet available and so the Episode III levels had to use music from other episodes. This has been fixed for The Complete Saga, as now the correct music is heard throughout. However, this only applies to in-game music. The music during the cutscenes remain the same. For instance, Obi-Wan's arrival on Utapau to confront General Grievous uses music from the Battle of Endor, and the music during the twins' birth is the concert piece from Return of the Jedi Luke and Leia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Levels"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There are 36 levels in this game, many of which are the same as those found in the original games. A level involving the pursuit of bounty hunter Zam Wesell was added (this was a deleted level from LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game), in addition to a Secret Level depicting Anakin Skywalker destroying the Droid Control Ship (though still not part of the Episode I level set). The game takes place from \"the Trade Federation's 'negotiations' with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace\" to \"the space battle above Endor in Return of the Jedi\", however it only covers the events seen in the films (so for instance the Clone Wars franchise is not depicted, let alone extant; however, the The Clone Wars franchise was covered in LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The \"Gunship Cavalry\" level was redesigned to encourage the open vehicle gameplay of LEGO Star Wars II, while \"Mos Espa Podrace\" was merged into one long track, rather than a segmented design from the original game (which can be played as a Bonus Level). These Bonus levels and 10 additional Bounty Hunter Missions add new challenges to the Prequel Trilogy. Also, the Episode I-III levels have been redesigned so that characters have to build, ride vehicles, wear helmets and get access to bounty hunter areas, to an extent that some secrets from the Prequel Trilogy have been changed so that you would need to have played the Original Trilogy to access them. An example is a Stormtrooper Door in Ruin of the Jedi, found in the Episode III Level set, and in the fifth Chapter of Episode I, where the player can use a small vehicle to help make the journey across the Theed Hangar shorter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Characters from the first three episodes are able to avoid getting hit by blaster shots and have their own special close attack move (such as Chewbacca's ability to rip off arms). New Jedi Force moves are included as well, such as the ability to flip Stormtrooper masks around. The red power bricks from Lego Star Wars II that unlocked different extras, such as invincibility and the minikit detector, are added to the prequel levels."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Episode I: The Phantom Menace"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 1: Negotiations"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 2: Invasion of Naboo"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 3: Escape from Naboo"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 4: Mos Espa Podrace"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 5: Retake Theed Palace"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 6: Darth Maul"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Character Bonus: Theed Palace"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Minikit Bonus: Tatooine"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Episode II: Attack of the Clones"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 1: Bounty Hunter Pursuit"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 2: Discovery on Kamino"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 3: Droid Factory"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 4: Jedi Battle"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 5: Gunship Cavalry"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 6: Count Dooku"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Character Bonus: Geonosis"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Minikit Bonus: Coruscant"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Episode III: Revenge of the Sith"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 1: Battle Over Coruscant"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 2: Chancellor in Peril"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 3: General Grievous"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 4: Defense of Kashyyyk"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 5: Ruin of the Jedi"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 6: Darth Vader"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Character Bonus: Mustafar"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Minikit Bonus: Kashyyyk"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Episode IV: A New Hope"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 1: Secret Plans"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 2: Through the Jundland Wastes"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 3: Mos Eisley Spaceport"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 4: Rescue the Princess"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 5: Death Star Escape"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 6: Rebel Attack"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Character Bonus: Mos Eisley"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Minikit Bonus: Death Star"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 1: Hoth Battle"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 2: Escape from Echo Base"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 3: Falcon Flight"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 4: Dagobah"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 5: Cloud City Trap"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 6: Betrayal Over Bespin"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Character Bonus: Bespin"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Minikit Bonus: Hoth"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Episode VI: Return of the Jedi"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 1: Jabba's Palace"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 2: The Great Pit of Carkoon"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 3: Speeder Showdown"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 4: The Battle of Endor"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 5: Jedi Destiny"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chapter 6: Into the Death Star"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Character Bonus: Endor"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Minikit Bonus: Endor"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Bonus Room"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Podrace (Original)"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Anakin's Flight"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Gunship Cavalry (Original)"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "A New Hope"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "LEGO City"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "New Town"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "PSP version"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When asked by numerous sources why the PSP console was excluded from the game's release, it was revealed that Traveler's Tales had limited resources and could not fit a PSP Version of the game in, however LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars would be released on the PSP years later."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
