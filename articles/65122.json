Formed from eager and often young conscripts, Army troopers served as expeditionary units of the Empire's ground forces, tasked with the subjugation of worlds that dared to resist the Emperor's rule.

Though they were separate from the more elite stormtroopers, army infantry fought alongside the notoriously zealous shock troops in order to bolster Imperial effectiveness during battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Army gradually upgraded and replaced the soldiers with stormtroopers as more planets fell under the control of the Galactic Empire, though army soldiers remained a core component of the galaxy-spanning regime."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 14 BBY, Imperial Army troopers fought under Moff Delian Mors against the Free Ryloth Movement, a coalition of freedom fighters founded by Cham Syndulla.
