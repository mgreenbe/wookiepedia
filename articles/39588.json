At some point by 3 ABY, the workers who lived there suffered from burns when the steam pipes in some magma extractors burst. The workers were subsequently forced to take leave off work and although a number of them had returned to their jobs, the rest risked eviction as they were still unable to go back. In 3 ABY, the stormtrooper Thara Nyende brought supplies to her uncle's cantina. Her uncle gave a tube of burn salve from the supplies to the Sullustan Myan for the workers in dorm four."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dorm four was mentioned in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
