Alongside Beta and Zeta it confronted the strike team sent to Zadd to halt Mentor's plans for droid revolution. Theta, and its fellows, engaged in combat by sharing abilities, passing a set of defensive shields from one shell to another. In spite of this tactic, it was destroyed by the strike team."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Theta did not have an independent consciousness at the time it was destroyed by the strike team, rather it was controlled by a portion of Mentor's awareness.
