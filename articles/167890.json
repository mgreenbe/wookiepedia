This worked to his and the hunters' advantages, as he always knew if a job had been carried out, and the hunters didn't have to bring in bodies. However, his spies weren't infallible; an amnesic Revan was able to fool them into thinking Matrik was dead by demolishing his apartment with a permacrete detonator after the Twi'lek had left. Some of his bounties were Dia, Largo, the aforementioned Matrik, Selven and Bendak Starkiller. However, they didn't pay all that well, so Zax's office usually just attracted credit-a-dozen bounty hunters instead of skilled professionals like Calo Nord."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bounties Zax offers the player in Knights of the Old Republic are all worth 300 credits.
