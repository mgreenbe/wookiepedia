During the Imperial Era, a mytag crystal masthead of Xim's skull was located on First Light, the star yacht of crime lord Dryden Vos. In the decades that followed, the mobile capital and flagship of the First Order, the Supremacy, was so large it was said to be bigger than even the most outlandish reconstructed versions of Xim's flagship. At one point, Tryphon Leo sought to be as wealthy as Xim, but ultimately died before achieving that goal. The labor droid Bollux once claimed to the bartender Tivoche \"Midnight\" Bilure that he had assisted the scoundrel Han Solo in destroying a battalion of war droids belonging to Xim. Bollux further stated that he was now tracking down sites and artifacts pertaining to Xim on behalf of a university in the Outer Rim Territories, and that he had travelled to Vandor to pursue a tip about a piece of treasure."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Xim the Despot was first mentioned in Star Wars canon in the 2017 reference book Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Incredible Cross-Sections, written by Jason Fry.
