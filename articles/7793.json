The tooka cat was prone to defecating on the family's carpet. Korin Aphra's obsession with his research on the Jedi splinter group Ordu Aspectu caused him to neglect his family and other responsibilities. His wife Lona Aphra grew tired of this and sarcastically remarked that she thought the Ordu Aspectu could stop the tooka from soiling the carpet. That day, Lona made the decision to leave her husband and instructed their young daughter Chelli Lona Aphra to pack her belongings. While Chelli packed, the family's tooka slept nearby on the carpet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Aphra family's tooka had red fur.
