They did this by casting their mind outside of their body to observe and scout out other planets for their masters. They were pitted in fierce survival in broods where only the strongest survive. Trill and Xesh were two known Hounds, with Xesh serving Predor Tul'kar and Trill serving Predor Skal'nas. Xesh was considered the best of the Force Hounds and even Skal'nas sought out his skills, but Tul'kar would not let anyone take his services without fighting him. Force Hounds could be set to duel each other in matches for the amusement of their masters, as Xesh was multiple times. Force Hounds had marks of their names placed extensively over their body and face so as to identify them if the battle didn't go well and the parts were collected."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
