Kenobi was informed by the Prime Minister of Kamino, Lama Su, that a bounty hunter named Jango Fett lived in Tipoca City, the capital city of Kamino. After Kenobi questioned Fett about the plot, Fett attempted to escape from Kamino with his clone son, Boba Fett. Kenobi confronted Fett and engaged him near Slave I, Fett's starship. During the duel, Kenobi managed to knock both twin blasters out of Fett's hands. Kenobi, however, lost his lightsaber, and as he used the Force to pull it back to him, Fett used his whipcord launcher, to yank Kenobi's hands away. The two fought hand-to-hand on the wet surface platform until Kenobi kicked Fett, which caused the bounty hunter to lose his footing and fall off the platform. Kenobi, who was still tied to Fett's whipcord, was pulled off the platform behind him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fett disconnected the whipcord that held Kenobi, and the Jedi fell down towards the ocean as Fett retreated back to his ship. The Jedi used the Force to secure himself with the cable Fett released, and swung towards a door below the platform they had dueled on. Fett boarded his ship as his son took off, while Kenobi rushed back out onto the platform. Kenobi located his lightsaber and ignited it, but Slave I had lifted off from the platform. Kenobi took out a tracking device from his belt and threw it onto the hull of the ship. Soon after, Kenobi tracked the pair to the Outer Rim planet of Geonosis, in his Delta-7 Jedi Starfighter and engaged Fett once more in the asteroid field above Geonosis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, the Jedi High Council gave Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi a mission to find the bounty hunter responsible for the plot to assassinate Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo. While his Padawan, Anakin Skywalker, had been given an assignment by the Council to protect Amidala on Naboo, Kenobi went to see his old friend, the Besalisk Dexter Jettster\u2014nicknamed Dex\u2014in Dex's Diner, to find more information about a toxic dart that the Jedi had taken from the body of Clawdite assassin Zam Wesell, who had been shot with the dart and killed before she could release information about the plot to assassinate Amidala. Dex told Kenobi that the dart belonged to the Kaminoans, a species who lived in the Wild Space, beyond the Outer Rim. After he left the diner, Kenobi, with the assistance of Jedi Librarian Jocasta Nu, used the Jedi Archives to find the planet of Kamino, which was missing from the archives, suggesting that it didn't exist. Troubled, Kenobi decided to discuss the issue with Jedi Grand Master Yoda."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yoda was instructing Bear Clan, a group of younglings. One of them, J. K. Burtola, suggested that Kamino had been erased from the archives, and Yoda told Kenobi to travel to the coordinates. Kenobi found Kamino where the coordinates said it should be, near the Rishi Maze. He landed on the rainy, oceanic planet and was greeted by Kaminoan Taun We, who took Kenobi to the Prime Minister, Lama Su. Su told Kenobi about a clone army that they had created for the Republic and to tell the Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas that the order will be shipped on schedule, confusing Kenobi as the Jedi Master had been dead for a decade. The two Kaminoans revealed that the host was a bounty hunter named Jango Fett. Taun We took Kenobi to Fett's living quarters in Kamino's capital, Tipoca City. Fett's genetically unaltered clone child, Boba Fett, allowed Taun We and the Jedi to enter. Jango soon approached the group, and We introduced the Jedi. Kenobi subtly interrogated Fett about the plot to assassinate Amidala, but Fett did not reveal any information. Fett, however, told Boba to close a closet door which contained his Mandalorian armor before answering his questions. He also denied knowledge of Sifo-Dyas, stating that he had been recruited by a man named Tyranus. As We and Kenobi exited Fett's quarters, Fett and his son prepared to leave Kamino immediately. Kenobi contacted Yoda and Jedi Master Mace Windu, and reported his discoveries, including that Sifo-Dyas had somehow managed to order a clone army for the Republic despite being dead. Yoda demanded that Kenobi bring Fett back to the galactic capital of Coruscant for further investigation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Windu also asked another Jedi to assist Kenobi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Duel"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While loading cargo onto their starship, Slave I, the Fetts prepared to leave Kamino, but Kenobi ran out onto the landing platform where Slave I was docked. Kenobi's presence alerted young Boba, who shouted to his father that the Jedi found them. Kenobi ignited his lightsaber, which forced Jango to pull out his twin WESTAR-34 blaster pistols and open fire on the Jedi. As Kenobi deflected Jango's blaster fire, the bounty hunter ignited his jetpack and hid himself on top of a lighting fixture. Unbeknownst to Kenobi, Jango fired the jetpack's missile at the Jedi, which exploded nearby, causing Kenobi to lose his lightsaber. Inside Slave I's cockpit, Boba activated the starship's heavy twin blaster cannons and fired towards Kenobi. The shots hit nearby, and Kenobi was thrown backwards across the platform. Jango reemerged from the fixture and flew towards Kenobi, who Force Jumped and kicked Fett, knocking the bounty hunter to the ground, and causing him to loose both of his blasters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the two engaged in hand-to-hand combat, Jango tried to grab onto the Jedi. With a quick kick at the bounty hunter's helmet, Jango was forced to release Kenobi. Upon regaining his feet, Fett stood up and head-butted Kenobi with his helmet, causing Kenobi to fall back onto the platform. The Jedi noticed his lightsaber near the edge of the platform and tried to call it to him. Jango shot his whipcord launcher at the Jedi, and the cord wrapped around the Jedi's outstretched hand and yanked him away from his lightsaber, dragging him across the platform."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi tangled the whipcord around a lighting fixture, causing Jango to crash onto the platform. The jetpack was released from his armor and exploded nearby. Standing up, the bounty hunter grabbed onto one of his fallen blasters and fired at Kenobi, who was running towards Jango. Kenobi kicked Jango off the platform, and then realized that he was still connected to the whipcord around his hands. Kenobi was flipped onto the side of the platform and slid down towards Jango."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Desperate to save his life, Jango activated a series of grappling tools on his arm and dug them into the platform to slow down his fall. Kenobi, however, slid past Jango and off over the edge of the platform, where he dangled, held by the whipcord. As Jango's grappling tools were failing due to the added weight, Jango released the whipcord, causing Kenobi to freefall down towards the ocean. Using the Force, Kenobi managed to throw the cord and attach it onto a structure below the platform. After making sure that the Jedi was nowhere to be seen, Jango used his grappling tools to crawl back to the top of the platform. Meanwhile, Kenobi flipped onto a ramp and reentered the city to catch up to Jango, who was boarding Slave I. Kenobi reemerged onto the platform and quickly recovered his lightsaber. Both Fetts, however, were aboard Slave I, which was now lifting off, and Kenobi to threw a homing beacon onto the side of the starship's hull."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Jango and Boba Fett left Kamino, Kenobi boarded his Delta-7 Jedi Starfighter and tracked Slave I in the Geonosis system. Once more, Kenobi engaged Fett over the asteroid field above the planet. After the conflict, Kenobi learned more of the assassination attempt on Amidala on Geonosis when he intercepted Jango and Count Dooku. Kenobi tried to contact his padawan, Anakin Skywalker, however he was not on Naboo. After he found out that Anakin disobeyed him, he contacted his apprentice on Tatooine and told him to redirect his message to Coruscant. Kenobi told Windu, Yoda and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine about how he tracked Jango Fett to a Droid foundry on Geonosis. The newly formed Separatist Council, and Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray is behind the assassination attempt on Amidala. Kenobi was then captured by Dooku's Geonosian workers and was held captive until the arrival of Skywalker and Amidala, whom attempted to rescue him, though they were captured as well. The First Battle of Geonosis, the first battle of the Clone Wars, began after the arrival of Windu and his Jedi strike team. Fett engaged Windu during the battle, and was killed after the Jedi Master used Sai cha to decapitate the bounty hunter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
