The text on the poster attempted to convey that the Trade Federation offered stability and guidance for the Republic and were working with the Galactic Senate to ensure this. Created by the Eleven Star Marketing company, the concept for the image was said to have been created by the Neimoidian Nute Gunray, and the piece was released during his tenure as Viceroy of the Federation, prior to the organization's split from the Republic during the Separatist Crisis. The public perception of the advertisement focused on the image's underlying depictions of the Federation's strength, dominance and underhand manipulation, with many claiming it represented Gunray's personal ambitions to own all of Coruscant. These claims were loudly countered by the Federation under the viceroy's command. Shortly after the Hosnian Cataclysm in the year 34 ABY, the piece was one of many included in the book A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Safe In Our Hands was an image created by Russell Walks for the reference book Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released on October 25, 2016."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
