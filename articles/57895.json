The group captured him and then presented the smuggler to Quaffug. Just for his amusement, the Hutt then ordered the bounty hunters to chase Lando in an elaborate hunt across the dangerous moon. During the chase, the hunters were caught up in a groundquake, and Calrissian was caught by the dangerous Jokhalli. Although they had failed to hunt down Calrissian, Quaffug decided to pay the hunters if they could retrieve Lando's remains. To collect their payment, Guchluk and the three other hunters waited anxiously outside Jokhalli territory. Unbeknownst to them, Calrissian had won his freedom in a game of divot, and he led the Jokhalli in capturing the four bounty hunters which he then presented before Quaffug. Guchluk was last seen as a prisoner of the Jokhalli warriors, whether he escaped alongside the other bounty hunters is unknown."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
