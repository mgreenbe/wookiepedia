It was one of four languages commonly spoken on the planet Utapau, along with Utai, Galactic Basic Standard and Amani. Utapese was spoken with low hissing sounds of varying volumes, giving a serpentine impression to those unfamiliar with the language. It was different from Basic in that complex ideas were conveyed with single, elongated sounds, rather than multiple words broken up by silent pauses."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
