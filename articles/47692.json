Savage pleaded for mercy for his brother, and Feral was spared despite failing in the final challenge. Savage became the champion and was taken by Ventress and given enhanced strength and power, enough to rival that of a Jedi Knight. Shortly thereafter, Feral was taken prisoner by the Nightsisters and brought before his brother so Savage could kill him as a test of loyalty and strength. Feral tried to appeal to Savage's love for him, but his brother's mind had become twisted by the Nightsister magic. Savage, disgusted by Feral's weakness, ignored the pleas. At Ventress' command, and with only a moment's hesitation, Savage grabbed Feral and used his newfound strength to break Feral's neck, murdering his brother and passing his final test."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
