He served in the Death Star's control room alongside battlestation commander Moff Tiaan Jerjerrod during the battle, witnessing the initial use of the Death Star's superlaser upon the attacking starships of the Rebel Alliance Fleet, and later relayed Jerjerrod's final command to use the Death Star to destroy the Forest Moon of Endor near the battle's climax, an order never carried out before the Death Star's own destruction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Human male Endicott was an orphan who attended the prestigious Academy of Carida, the toughest Imperial training facility in the galaxy.

Vader's visit came completely unannounced in an effort to remedy the Death Star's lagging construction schedule. Once Endicott realized that an approaching shuttle bearing a class-one priority ranking and requesting for the Death Star to deactivate its deflector shield was carrying the Dark Lord, he ordered Jad Bean, a nearby shield operator, to notify Moff Tiaan Jerjerrod, the Death Star's commander, of their distinguished guest's arrival. Endicott then proceeded to head toward the docking bay and Vader's shuttle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the subsequent Battle of Endor, the climactic confrontation between the Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Endicott was again present within the Death Star's control room, serving under Jerjerrod's direct command.

Upon seeing that the shield was down, Endicott immediately notified Jerjerrod, adding that the Death Star had lost contact with the generating station. As instructed, Jerjerrod then ordered Endicott to position the Death Star to destroy the moon, which Endicott relayed to a nearby gunner. Before Jerjerrod could execute the order to obliterate Endor, however, the Rebels instead destroyed the Death Star, killing the Emperor, Vader, and Jerjerrod in a sweeping victory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Endicott, a docking bay technician, displayed a certain shock of recognition, exclaiming Darth Vader's name aloud to himself, upon realizing that the Dark Lord had suddenly and unexpectedly arrived aboard the Death Star.
