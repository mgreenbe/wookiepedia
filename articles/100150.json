In 5000 BBY, Sadow tasked the Omen, captained by Yaru Korsin, to mine Lignan ore for use in the upcoming Sith invasion of the Galactic Republic. However, the Omen and its sister ship, the Harbinger, were attacked by Jedi. As the Omen fled into hyperspace, it was knocked off-course, causing it to crash-land on the remote world Kesh. There, the surviving Sith crew remained stranded for thousands of years. With the help of the native Keshiri, the Sith built a temple over the Omen's crash site. In 41 ABY, however, the Sith Meditation Sphere Ship arrived on Kesh and took the Sith off-world, assisting them in ambushing starships in order to scavenge parts to rebuild the Omen.

The two Sith vessels found Lignan in the largest moon of Phaegon III, but they were ambushed by a Jedi starfighter.
