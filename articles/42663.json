A cynical man disguising himself as an unending patriot, Ecressys routinely complained of the lack of support for his rule from the government in the Core Worlds, and because of this, was suspected by the Imperial Security Bureau of disloyalty to Emperor Sheev Palpatine. However, after Palpatine's death during the Battle of Endor, Ecressys spread the news of his Imperial master's survival in a bid to prop up his own power, closely controlling all communication within the Velcar sector and breaking away from the Empire to create his own remnant faction. On top of that, he took his newfound reign for granted, plundering the treasuries of the planets he ruled. By the time the New Republic arrived to the sector's capital to announce the signing of the Galactic Concordance, the governor had fled to the Western Reaches with the wealth of hundreds of worlds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
