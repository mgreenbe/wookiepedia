Uingali foar Marocsaa entrusted Chiss Senior Captain Thrawn with a double-ring of a chimaera, a treasured heirloom of the Marocsaa subclan, in the event of the extinction of the Paccosh at the hands of the Nikardun Destiny. The next time Thrawn met Uingali, the Paccosh had a flagship bearing the crest of the chimaera. Thrawn returned the chimaera ring to Uingali, but would eventually adopt the chimaera as his personal symbol. Years later, as Grand Admiral of the Galactic Empire, Thrawn's flagship Imperial Star Destroyer would bear the name Chimaera."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
