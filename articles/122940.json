Following the cataclysmic destruction of the planet near the end of the war in 19 BBY, the stronghold was located on the planetoid PM-6986 in the Anaxes asteroid belt. The base housed a droid complement that once served within the army of Harch Admiral Trench during the Battle of Anaxes, and had managed to survive both the battle and the cataclysm. After the planet's destruction, the complement was reactivated by the tactical droid JF-86, who had previously been reawakened by a Separatist signal that originated light-years away."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Separatist stronghold was mentioned in Dawn of Rebellion, a roleplaying supplementary sourcebook for the Star Wars Roleplaying series that was published by Fantasy Flight Games in 2018."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
