Famed for bringing peace and order to the lawless planet of Ord Mantell early in his Jedi career, he participated in the Battle of Geonosis in 22 BBY, where over two hundred members of the Jedi Order battled the vast droid armies of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Pablo-Jill was one of few on his side to survive, though he became separated from the bulk of his fellow Jedi during the fighting."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Three years later, he led a daring attempt to rescue Supreme Chancellor Palpatine from the clutches of the commander of the Separatist Droid Army, General Grievous, over Coruscant. Many of the other Jedi gave up, but Pablo-Jill continued in his efforts to intercept Grievous's tri-wing shuttle, and eventually dueled with the cyborg aboard the Separatist flagship, Invisible Hand. Grievous proved too strong for the Ongree Jedi Knight, however, and killed him. After the duel, Pablo-Jill's body was launched into space for all the Republic forces to see."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Jedi Knight"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pablo-Jill was born in the Skustell Cluster some time before the Separatist Crisis. He was a member of the Ongree: a bipedal, hunchbacked species with amphibious tendencies. He was found to be Force-sensitive, and eventually became a Padawan of the Jedi Order;[source?] he rose in ranks until he became a Jedi Knight. After his elevation, he was dispatched to the planet Ord Mantell in the Mid Rim region of the galaxy,[source?] tasked with bringing peace and order to the lawless world. He was successful, albeit only for a time: once he left the planet matters slowly returned to as they had been before he arrived. His efforts on Ord Mantell made him famous among the Jedi; the High Council encouraged him to take an apprentice of his own, though, for reasons he kept to himself,[source?] he never took a Padawan."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Geonosis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He was among the Jedi stationed in the Jedi Temple in 22 BBY when the Order received word that Obi-Wan Kenobi had been captured by the Confederacy of Independent Systems on Geonosis in the Outer Rim Territories after tracking the bounty hunter Jango Fett to the barren planet. Along with fellow Ongree Jedi Coleman Kcaj and over two hundred other members of the Order,[source?] he flew to the Outer Rim to fight the vast droid army of the CIS. Pablo-Jill sneaked into the stands in the huge Petranaki arena, where Kenobi, Republic senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, and Kenobi's Padawan Anakin Skywalker were slated for execution."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alongside Mirialan Jedi Padawan Barriss Offee, Pablo-Jill fought against thousands of battle droids in the arena; however, they were both eventually separated from the rest of the Jedi, and were left behind by the LAAT/i gunships led by Grand Master Yoda. They ultimately managed to survive and participated with the rest of the surviving Jedi in the Battle of Geonosis, where they fought alongside battalions of clone troopers brought by Yoda from Kamino. Eventually, the Republic and Jedi proved victorious, though many lives had been lost."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Coruscant"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 BBY, during the CIS assault of Coruscant, Pablo-Jill piloted a Jedi interceptor against the Confederate Navy in an attempt to recover the shuttle that had abducted Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. General Grievous, commander of the Separatist Droid Army, had kidnapped the Chancellor from the capital world, and Pablo-Jill, along with fellow Jedi Agen Kolar and Saesee Tiin, led the rescue attempt. They had been the closest to hitting the shuttle, but Grievous had managed to evade them by firing on local debris, which provided obstacles for the Jedi and allowed him to further outrun them. Tiin, Kolar, and Pablo-Jill were able to evade the debris, though, and were firing on the shuttle incessantly, but Grievous's superior flying ability and the ship's strong shields meant their weapons had little impact. As they exited Coruscant's atmosphere, they began to perform more complex maneuvers and were soon joined by Nautolan Jedi Master Kit Fisto; they were slowly overpowering the shuttle's shield generator. Grievous was eventually forced to fire on innocent vessels in the vicinity in an effort to persuade the Jedi to fall back; they did so, though when it became a straight race for Grievous's flagship, the Invisible Hand, the Jedi, aided by several other Republic vessels, attacked the shuttle once again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They were close to intercepting the vehicle when hundreds of droid fighters surged toward them, safeguarding Grievous's shuttle as it flew toward his great flagship. While many of the other pilots fell back in an attempt to defend themselves, Pablo-Jill and two others continued onwards towards the Chancellor. One of the fighters was eventually destroyed by cannon fire, but Pablo-Jill and the other pilot, a Lorrdian male Jedi Knight named L'lacielo Sageon, swerved out of the way and continued their pursuit of Grievous. The Invisible Hand used a tractor beam to draw in Grievous's shuttle, which was heavily damaged, and with it came the interceptors of both Pablo and Sageon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As soon as their ships touched down in the hangar bay of the ship, Pablo-Jill and the other Jedi jumped out of their starfighters and drew their lightsabers, deflecting the blaster bolts sent at them by the CIS droids as they ran towards the shuttle, intent on rescuing Palpatine. One of them plunged a lightsaber through the hull of the ship, stirring Grievous into action. The Kaleesh cyborg engaged the two Knights in a duel; the droids had ceased shooting as they were afraid to hit Grievous. They dueled for several moments, though in the end Grievous was too powerful for them; he stabbed downwards into each of their chests, killing them. Pablo-Jill's body was launched into space at Grievous's command for all Republic forces to see. Grievous also added Pablo-Jill's lightsaber to his collection of Jedi weapons taken from those he had slain."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pablo-Jill was a brave and selfless being\u2014he risked his life for the Republic in both the Battle of Geonosis and the Battle of Coruscant. Even after the Invisible Hand's tractor beam pulled him and L'lacielo Sageon onto Grievous's ship, Pablo-Jill did not give up, and bravely fought the former Kaleesh warlord. He also demonstrated his bravery during his time on Ord Mantell, when he almost singlehandedly brought peace to the planet of criminals and bounty hunters. Pablo-Jill was also extremely loyal to the Republic, the Jedi Order, and the Chancellor; he gave his life in an attempt to free the head of state, while many more senior-ranking Jedi retreated so that they could defend themselves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though skilled with the Force, Pablo-Jill was more martial than most Jedi, and favoured use of his lightsaber in battle. He wielded a blue-bladed lightsaber during the Battle of Geonosis\u2014effectively enough to survive the battle, where hundreds of other Jedi perished while fighting the vast droid army of the CIS. Pablo-Jill was also quick to brandish his weapon above Coruscant in 19 BBY, and skillfully deflected the blaster bolts from Grievous's droids. Grievous described the Ongree Knight as a decent adversary, and more skilled than the ones he had encountered when taking Palpatine, among them Roron Corobb, B'ink Utrila, Foul Moudama, and Roth-Del Masona; in the end, however, he was not strong enough to survive the encounter with Grievous and the cyborg added Pablo's lightsaber to his collection; Jill would be considered one of the General's most notorious kills. He was also a skilled pilot\u2014having been chosen along with the likes of Saesee Tiin, one of the best Jedi pilots of the time, and Agen Kolar, for the mission to rescue Palpatine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pablo-Jill was one of few completely computer-generated characters in the Prequel trilogy. He was one of only three CGI Jedi in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. Because of Pablo-Jill's awkward, bulky form and multi-jointed legs, it was decided that he would look best using computer animation. He was named in a StarWars.com Databank update slightly over a month later. The Databank entry also gave his species and expanded upon his background."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There was originally some confusion between Pablo-Jill and the Ongree member of the Jedi Council seen in Revenge of the Sith, with early Set Diaries naming the other Ongree Pablo-Jill and later Sweitt Concorkill, though he was eventually named Coleman Kcaj. The character was originally meant to be Pablo-Jill, but because the Ongree in Episode III needed a more detailed CGI model, a new character was created, similar to how Eeth Koth became Agen Kolar and Adi Gallia became Stass Allie. Eventually, Unknown Soldier: The Story of General Grievous\u2014an article by Abel G. Pe\u00f1a appearing in Star Wars Insider 86 in 2006\u2014established that one of the Jedi killed on the Invisible Hand appearing in James Luceno's Labyrinth of Evil was Pablo-Jill. Labyrinth of Evil named Pablo-Jill in an earlier chapter, but did not name the two Jedi killed by Grievous."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
