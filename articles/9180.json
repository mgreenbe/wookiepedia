He contacted Seib Nod, the ex-member of Sisterhood of the Beatific Countenance from Lorrd, to buy some artifacts related to the cult. At first he was suspicious about the items, but when Nod told him that Sisterhood sells them because it needs money, he agreed to do the deal. However, he was double-crossed, when Nod threatened him with a blaster and took the money without giving artifacts in a return. Pratuhr was trying to find the thief, seeing her entering the Outlander Club, but he finally managed to locate her in dock, where Nod was trying to leave the planet. Once again she used the blaster to intimidate him, but Zey Nep used her own pistol to corner Nod and apprehend her. Finally, Seib Nod was turned to the authorities, money came back to Pratuhr and artifacts returned to their rightful owners on Lorrd."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Artuo Pratuhr was portrayed by Droid Unit supervisor Don Bies in Attack of the Clones."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
