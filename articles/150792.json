In 3643 BBY Lokai became a target of the Great Hunt and his ship was shot down over Tatooine by a Rodian bounty hunter named Veeboo Lunx. Tyresius bribed Lunx into abandoning the Hunt and tried to escape the planet under an alias, but was pursued by another bounty hunter across the Dune Sea desert. Eventually, Lokai was cornered at his ship's landing cite, where he persuaded the Hunter into letting him live by presenting a genetically identical clone to claim his bounty. Changing his name to Gault Rennow, Lokai left on the Hunter's D5-Mantis Patrol Craft, abandoning his ship on Tatooine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tyresius Lokai's starship appears in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic during the Bounty Hunter class mission on Tatooine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
