One Leviathan even broke into the Grand Lord's palace just as the scholarly Varner Hilts had begun efforts to evacuate the Tribe's prized tomes. The monster was about to devour the elderly Sith Lord when Spinner arrived over the palace in the Last Hope. Spinner then used the ship's tractor beam projector to drag the Leviathan into the skies. He then used the ship's turbolaser cannons to destroy the beast. Spinner also used the starship's intercom system to announce to the Grand Lord that he had come to help the Tribe.

However, Spinner remained defiant and told the Sith Lord that he was \"going to send him back to his coffin in pieces.\" At that point, Takara used Force lightning to attack the massive Leviathan, beheading the monster.
