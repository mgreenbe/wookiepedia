Only a fraction of those bases were active at any one time, with most of them being dormant, empty of personnel, equipment, and starfighters. Due to starfighter combat being \"fluid\", a system or sector could be active one week and quiet the next week, or vice versa. Therefore whenever a campaign was forthcoming, the Rebel Alliance tried to have operational starfighter bases nearby. Whenever a system was about to \"heat up\", the Rebels would activate a dormant base, sending their techs first, then the support team, and finally the starfighters. After the campaign, they relocated the equipment, ships, and personnel to other bases, and shut down power to the base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Usually a starfighter base had more pilots than starfighters, ideally 25 to 50 percent more, thereby allowing them to relive tired pilots or replace injured ones. Depending on the terrain and the possibility of Imperial infantry attack, the base could have up to 1,000 infantrymen in support. Who could be equipped with artillery, speeders, and heavy weapons. Starfighter bases had starfighter repair facilities which were equipped with diagnostic equipment, spare parts, fuel, etc. They were also equipped with communications and medical equipment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
