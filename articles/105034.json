He was friends with Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Bail Organa. During the war, Philo called a meeting with some of his fellow senators to discuss the Enhanced Privacy Invasion Bill, and hoped to stop the vote. None of the Senators knew, however that Cad Bane and a group of bounty hunters had infiltrated the Senate building. While in their discussion, Bane entered the lobby and let out two gunshots, causing the Senators to look round in surprise. Bane said they were now his prisoners. Philo scoffed, saying he refused to be part of this mockery and went to leave. Bane then shot the Gran in the back, killing him with the single shot. His body remained there when the hunters set explosive charges to kill the other senators if they moved. Bane then left, the first part of his mission a success. Bane succeeded in breaking Ziro Desilijic Tiure out of prison using the senate hostages to bargain. He then went to detonate the charges, but Anakin Skywalker was able to save them in time by cutting a hole in the floor. Philo's body was destroyed in the explosion. He was the only senator to die during the hostage crisis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and Traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Philo wanted to stop the invasion bill from being voted on and had a mindset similar to his fellow senator, Padm\u00e9 Amidala.
