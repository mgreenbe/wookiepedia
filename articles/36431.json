In some cases, the generator could project the shield a great distance and without need for line of sight, by using a focusing dish. Variants included planetary shield generators, such as the SLD-26 planetary shield generator used to protect the second Death Star in orbit over the moon of Endor, and the DSS-02 shield generator used to protect Echo Base during the Battle of Hoth. The Gungans used handheld shield generators along with shield generators on the backs of their fambaas. The Imperial Army used a force shield projector to protect their base on Borleias around 7 ABY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shield generators were used on Podracers as well, both custom and factory-built models. Typically low-output, these shield generators were installed within the cockpit and were meant to protect the pilot from exhaust wash and debris kicked up by the engines. In most instances, the shields were useless in the event of a crash, though some racers invested in full-spectrum generators to protect themselves and their vehicle from destruction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
