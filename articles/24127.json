Located near the Twelve Mounts, the building was part of the Prefsbelt Naval Academy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the Galactic Empire and the restructuring of the Academy system, the ancient stones of the castle were dwarfed by the soaring buildings and towers of the rest of the Naval Academy. A multi-kilometer-long passage linked Castle Pradeux to the Naval Crypt in the heart of the Twelve Mounts range, where Pers Pradeux's body was entombed. The night before graduation from the Academy, naval Midshipmen would walk the length of this pitch-dark passage in silence to the Crypt, where each would dedicate themselves to the naval service."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
