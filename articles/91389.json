When he said that their ship had been destroyed by Kenobi, Vizsla and Maul concluded the two had a common enemy. The two then allied with each other and began to plot taking Mandalore for themselves. First, however, they were to rally the Black Sun on Mustafar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The mission"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon their arrival on Mustafar, Maul, Opress, Vizsla, Bo-Katan and other Death Watch soldiers met with Ziton Moj who took them inside the facility to meet with Xomit Grunseit. Moj believed that Maul and his allies would have no chance in successfully recruiting Grunseit. Maul attempted to rally Grunseit to his cause, which Opress enforced by killing a Falleen guard, but Grunseit refused to ally with Maul and mocked him as well as his allies, so he was killed by Opress, who hurled his lightsaber from across a table, which also killed Grunseit's four other leaders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following Grunseit's death, Ziton Moj willingly joined Maul's new army.
