By the time of the New Republic era, it was regarded as a crime haven and also hosted the headquarters of a paramilitary faction known as the Amaxine warriors. The Sibensko complex also hosted a cantina that contained a computer which could access the city's computer core."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 28 ABY, Senator Leia Organa and her team traveled to Sibensko to investigate the Amaxine warriors. While Leia's companions Greer Sonnel and Joph Seastriker loaded a shipment of thermal detonators, Leia and C-3PO managed to download banking records proving that the Amaxines were linked to Rinnrivin Di's cartel. Leia later killed Rinnrivin and his bodyguards during a brief shootout. The complex and the Amaxine base was destroyed during a brief skirmish when a starfighter crashed into the city's ammunition depot. This triggered a massive explosion that wiped out all of the city's inhabitants."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
