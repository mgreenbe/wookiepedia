The outpost mined several carbonite deposits and other ores found on the planet. In around the year 3643 BBY the miners stationed there abandoned the post due to the thawing of a frozen terentatek that had been buried deep in the mines. This allowed scavengers to move in and claim the deposits while avoiding the Terentatek."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The outpost was first mentioned as part of the scavenging crew skills mission \"The Carbonite Mines\" in the 2011 BioWare MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
