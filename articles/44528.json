In 20 BBY, Kenobi's fleet was attacked by a Separatist armada led by General Grievous. During the battle, Engle performed bombing runs on the Separatist warships in his Y-wing starfighter while another clone pilot, \"Killer,\" provided him with covering fire. His gunner also shot down vulture droids during the battle. However, after Killer was killed, vulture droids attacked and destroyed his Y-wing. Eventually, Engle crash-landed in the hangar bay of the Negotiator. Somehow, Engle survived the crash that killed the gunner. Kenobi then helped Engle to safety from the wreckage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Engle had the standard Phase II armor worn by clone pilots with green markings on his helmet and his shoulders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
