They consisted of several metallic cylinders hanging on fine threads, in the middle of which would hang a Hutt-shaped piece of flattened metal. The wind caused the Hutt shape to move and waver, hitting the chimes and thus producing a metallic noise. The Nar Shaddaa wind chimes were a symbol of renewal in Hutt society."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jabba Desilijic Tiure, the kajidii of the Desilijic clan, possessed a set of such windchimes, made of four tubes. That set was among the few possessions that Jabba brought with him when he moved the headquarters of his criminal empire from Nar Shaddaa to the sun-scorched world of Tatooine in 516 BBY. The Hutt had a throne room built in the subterranean level of a former monastery of the B'omarr Order, which became his palace. The crime lord's wind chime was hung in the archway of the main entrance to the throne room. It was still hanging there in 4 ABY, but Jabba's assassination that same year caused the palace and all it contained to fall into abandonment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
