With the assistance of Alliance Intelligence, two captured Rebel pilots were able to escape from Stars' End prison by stowing away on the Hampton. Knowing that the Imperial EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate Furious was in the sector and was under orders to search any ships, the Rebels mounted a quick rescue comprising of the Lambda-class shuttle Mercy and two Y-wings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Y-wings quickly destroyed the Hampton's TIE fighter escort and disabled the Hampton ready for boarding. The Furious arrived shortly afterward and began launching TIEs of its own along with stormtrooper transports to recapture the freighter.
