Following the end of the Clone Wars, Separatist holdout forces began to operate from the citadel, and during the Western Reaches Operation in 17 BBY, Imperial forces were dispatched to the world to drive the Separatists from the fortress. In the resulting battle, the Empire's Sword Squadron, under the command of the ace pilot Captain Shea Hublin, disabled the citadel's energy shields, and the Imperial forces were ultimately victorious."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
