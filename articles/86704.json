Known as \"The Wizard\" among his peers, Sione had worked off-the-grid on the industrial world of Kuat since his youth. For this reason, the Empire put forth their best efforts to find and capture the young lad, but to no avail. Marcus always seemed to have an escape route, even in the worst of situations.
