As the Galactic Empire had broken the Rebellion's encryption codes and was thus able to track down the fleet divisions as they made contact with one another, the combined forces of the Fourth and Seventh Divisions wished to develop new codes. To do so, they intended to use the extinct Trawak language, which was contained in the databanks of an ancient Autonomous Translator Module, Mark II that was stored within the Imperial Museum on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rebels sent a team of Pathfinders\u2014Kes Dameron, Frell, and Needle\u2014who were taken past the security cordons at Coruscant in the Millennium Falcon by Lando Calrissian and his cyborg assistant, Lobot. Once on Coruscant, Lobot sliced into the museum's database to locate the linguistics droid within the curator's private collection. While Needle drew the curator out by causing a disturbance, the other Pathfinders incapacitated the museum guards outside the collection, allowing Lobot to slice the lock on the door. The rebels retrieved the droid, but Needle was caught, and the curator sentenced him to death. When the team returned to the Fourth and Seventh Divisions, the protocol droid C-3PO reactivated the linguistics droid, discovering that its memory banks had been corrupted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
