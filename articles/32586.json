No bigger than a TIE fighter, it looked similar to an egg and trailed a metallic seine behind it. When the ship would land, a portion of the seine would curl over the back of the ship like a scorpion's tail. There was no visible hatch and the ship was covered in scorch marks, which gave it the appearance of having been through every battle since the Clone Wars. Boba Fett arranged clearance for this ship to land at the Bounty Hunters' Guild."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
