Being in an intermediate state between and avian and a reptilian, it had the body of a dinosaur and the head and feet of a bird. It was colorful like a bird, its head having the shape of a giant beak with razor-sharp tooth-like protrusions and a small horn at the end of the beak. It had poor eyesight but excellent olfactory senses and would attack virtually anything that moved."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
