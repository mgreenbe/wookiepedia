It had a top speed of 65 kilometers per hour. Although it was a small transport designed with the capacity to carry only a single being, it had just enough space to carry a second passenger in emergencies. It was highly maneuverable even in urban areas densely populated by crowds of other sentient creatures. It was equipped with gyroscopic sensors which assisted the operator by automatically compensating for many sudden terrain hazards, such as ice or oil slicks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The controls stood atop a column which rose from the meter-wide floor plate. After setting the desired speed and navigational options, the operator stood upon the floor plate while gripping adjustable handlebars, shifting their body mass to steer. A light repulsor field acted as a windscreen to protect the pilot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
