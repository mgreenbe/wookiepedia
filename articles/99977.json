By the time Empress Vaylin took the Eternal Throne, Oleg was a beastmaster working at the Royal Palace of the Eternal Dragon. During the Grand Festival of Empress Vaylin in 3630 BBY he scolded apprentive Bev for letting Bergola get sick, while also preparing his beasts to be unleashed on captured Zakuulan rebels at Vaylin's command. After Vaylin's speech was interrupted by the arrival of first Alliance Commander and then former Emperor Arcann, Oleg sent a Rancor named Junior as well as a pack of Exoboars including Brick, Lil' Jwizzix and Rompy to deal with the rebels. He then went to battle Arcann's loyalists himself, accompanied by two vorn tigers Cho'Kri and Cho'Ale. They were all killed during the three-way fighting in the Palace reception area."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Beast Master Oleg appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne during \"Chapter VI: The Dragon's Maw.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
