The lesson was meant to teach select Tarkin males the importance of what their family had built and the necessity to force others to abide by the imposed law, by force if need be. The Carrion was maintained as a way to show the Tarkins what Eriadu had been like before their ancestors had arrived from the Core to colonize their world, and to show them that \"life remained a constant battle for survival.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once his initiation was done, Jova took the unexpected decision to remain in the Carrion to make it his home and become a permanent guide and mentor for future Tarkin initiates. This decision made him the first of the long line of Tarkins to choose to remain in the Carrion, building his own cabin on the land. In this capacity, Jova came to train his own nephew and his great-nephew, Wilhuff, when the time for their initiations came."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jova Tarkin first appeared in the 2014 novel Tarkin, written by James Luceno.
