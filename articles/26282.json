The clumsy droid was the first to encounter R2-D2 after he had been thrown, deactivated, into the Heep's Droid harem. Extending one of its hidden mechanical arms, the droid reactivated R2 and the two droids quickly became friends. However, the friendship suffered a setback after R2-D2 became infatuated with an egg shaped astromech droid named KT-10 and began ignoring the spherical droid. Following the defeat of the Great Heep, the spherical droid joined forces with the other liberated astromechs to revive KT-10, who had been completely drained of power as a result of being fed to the Great Heep."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Choco first appeared in the Star Wars Droids TV special The Great Heep.
