Unfortunately, Bastra was captured by Loor and interrogated. After one interrogation session, Bastra was immersed in bacta. This killed Bastra due to an allergy he had previously developed from a contaminated batch of bacta from Lot ZX1449F. This contamination had also caused Bastra to contract blastonecrosis, a fact which Loor had used in an unsuccessful attempt to break Bastra. The signs of the disease had been hidden because Bastra regularly took doses of lotiramine, a chemical which interacted lethally with the truth serum skirtopanol, to prevent Imperial agents from gaining information from him. Bastra's death was documented in Imperial HoloNet transmission A34020121."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In one scene, he is called \"Gus Bastra.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
