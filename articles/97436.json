Thus, nobody in the CorSec knew how Frangee looked like at the moment of his death. The spacer who killed him later used Frangee's CorSec badge to pass himself off as Frangee on Corellia. The spacer met one of the CorSec senior officers, Captain Thale Dustrunner, in the Coronet Capitol. Dustrunner fell for the ruse and took the spacer for the long lost agent. He ordered him to protect Aldalad, a witness who wanted to testify against Borvo, and Maerzen, who had discovered evidence against Borvo the Hutt. The spacer killed both of them and returned to Naboo, leaving the CorSec  without any evidence against the Hutt crime lord."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Niksel Frangee appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online-role playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
