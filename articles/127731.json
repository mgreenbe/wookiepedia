Those who ingested the herb experienced an overwhelming and stupefying euphoria, earning them the epithet \"smilers,\" due to the perpetual grins on their faces. They were described as the only truly content individuals in the galaxy. A smiler exhibited a totally accommodating nature, and would do anything for anyone.
