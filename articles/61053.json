He was a member of the crew of the transport Daring, alongside Captain Dindau and the Wookiee first mate Kohlbacca. Aboard the Daring, Herren served as its engineer and gunner. When the ship collided with an asteroid, the Daring's engines went dead and Herren was hit by the ionic backwash from them. This gave him severe electrical burns and cerebral shock that brought him close to death. The Heroes of Cularin attempt to rescue Herren and his ship mates before the life support systems on the Daring failed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
