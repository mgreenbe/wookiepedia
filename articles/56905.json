The character was included by George Lucas as a reference to the 1982 film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, which had been made by his friend Steven Spielberg and included a child dressed as Yoda for Halloween as a reference to The Empire Strikes Back. In E.T., the title character, an alien from an unidentified planet, sees the face of Yoda and says \"Home!\" This led to a popular speculation that E.T. was a resident of the Star Wars galaxy and had met Yoda or another member of his species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the new Star Wars canon, Grebleips' name was first used in a 2019 episode of The Star Wars Show.
