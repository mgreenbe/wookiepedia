The assassin droid subsequently established a hideout in a landspeeder garage in Trevura's capital city, Voma. When Blask learned that a droid would attempt to kill him, the governor was afraid that it would be a high-level assassin like IG-88.

In combat, the droid could perform skilled shots at point blank distance. S-R6 also possessed a variety of skills less directly related to his trade, such as gun craftsmanship and piloting, was very proficient in repairing technology and using explosives, and had extensive knowledge of munitions. S-R6 was also skilled in the use of computers and was able to program the protocol droid T-3PO to use a hold-out blaster, although the latter droid was not a very good shot.

The droid became a connoisseur and avid collector of various firearms from around the galaxy, constantly seeking to add new or exotic weapons to his private collection. He was very interested in acquiring prototype Imperial weapons, with his interest as both a professional and collector being peaked by the inhibitor guns on Trevura. In addition to the information on the inhibitor weapons he gained from his spy droid, S-R6 was also interested in learning about the various experiences related to the firearms' use, such as the feeling one had when hit by a blast from the gun, or how a Human would hold one of the weapons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to ensure anonymity, for each mission S-R6 had his central programming and circuits transferred to a different droid shell.

Due to his ability to see in the dark, S-R6 once forgot that organic beings frequently needed light to see. As part of his labor droid disguise, S-R6 pretended to be very stupid and only communicated in public by using the words \"affirmative\" and \"negative.\" In the privacy of his garage, however, the assassin droid communicated via surprisingly fluent speech."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the \"inhibitor incident,\" S-R6 carried two guns, one of which was a standard blaster rifle, and six stun grenades.

If the characters pick up the weapons, S-R6 instructs his protocol droid go-between, T-3PO, to approach them and offer 600 credits for both weapons. If the characters agree to the deal, T-3PO leads them to S-R6's garage, where the assassin droid greets the characters and personally continues the negotiation for the weapons."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If the characters do not pick up the inhibitor guns, they are then collected by S-R6 in the disguise of a labor droid performing cleanup on behalf of the Trevura government. The \"labor droid\" then beckons for the characters to follow to his garage, upon which they can either choose to ignore the droid and quickly make preparations to leave the planet or follow him to his hideout, where S-R6 proceeds to question the characters about their experience with the inhibitor guns. Regardless of which scenario the player-characters follow, they end up in S-R6's garage, proceeding to the remaining part of the adventure.
