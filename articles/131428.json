Aside from a few basic troopers who are fairly useless except as scouts, most construction options revolve around the player's economy and getting that off the ground. Once 500 food has been stockpiled, the player will have the option to advance to the Second Tech Level. This will open up more buildings and units forming basic armies. 800 food and 200 nova will allow advancement to the Third Tech Level where combat can become truly three dimensional with the ability to construct air units. 1000 food and 800 nova will let the player then advance to the Fourth and final Tech level where expensive upgrades are available but the benefits they bring to one's faction are often worth the excessive cost."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each worker unit which often takes the form of labor droids, Wookiees, or whatever suits the player's faction, can be individually controlled by the player and they can be ordered to gather resources, construct buildings and even attack enemy units and buildings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There are four types of resources, all of which need to be gathered at a steady rate in order to supply a constant flow of resources: Carbon is used primarily to construct buildings and is often used in technology research and can be found in trees or in \"carbon deposits\". Food is used to help train units and can also be used to a lesser extent in technology research. Food can be gathered from muja fruits, fish, hunting or farms, and from nerfs or banthas housed in an animal nursery. Nova crystals are used primarily in technology research and to train some units. They are also used as currency at the marketplace where buy and sell prices are listed in nova crystal value. The crystals are primarily mined but can also be traded for other resource at the marketplace, trade caravans can deposit a fixed amount of crystal between two marketplaces and Holocrons can provide a steady stream if housed at a Jedi Temple or Sith Temple. Finally, there is ore which is mostly used to construct fixed defensive structures like turrets, fortresses and anti-air defenses as well as in some technology research.

Certain factions will gain extra crystals from holocrons, others will gain fewer. To capture a holocron from an enemy temple, the temple must suffer heavy damage to the holocron is ejected before its annihilation and then a Jedi/Sith unit can collect it. The standard skirmish victory condition allows for a \"Holocron victory\" - if one player gathers all holocrons, a countdown begins and if it expires, victory is awarded.
