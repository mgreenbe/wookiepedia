He joined the Jedi Order and completed his Jedi training on the planet Ossus under the tutelage of a Jedi Master. In 3976 BBY, the Mandalorian Neo\u2013Crusaders began attacking worlds in the Outer Rim Territories, beginning the Mandalorian Wars. Renstaal fought alongside his Master during the early stages of the conflict until his Master was killed during the First Battle of Onderon. Afterward, Renstaal joined the Revanchists, a renegade faction of Jedi led by the Jedi Knight Revan, and fought in the Mandalorian Wars against the wishes of the Jedi High Council. Following the defeat of the Mandalorians in 3960 BBY, the Revanchists traveled to the Unknown Regions, and Renstaal accompanied them. There, the Revanchists adopted the teachings of the Sith and reformed themselves to become Darth Revan's Sith Empire.

During the attack, a team of Republic agents was sent to the ship's Security Command, or \"SecCom,\" center, from where they planned to order all of the ship's security teams to go to the aft side of the flagship, allowing a team of Jedi to make their way to the bridge and capture Revan.

In the supplement, the players role-play as the Republic agents that Voren encounters and their encounter with him can go a number of ways, depending upon the actions of the player characters. If the players kill more than half of the Sith troopers in the SecCom center, Voren and the Sith Marauders directly attack the player characters and will fight to the death, rather than surrender."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The players can speak to Voren and try and get him to tell them the code for the SecCom computer system, which they can do by either interrogating him or by trying to persuade him that it is his best interest to help them. If they tell him that the aim of their mission is to capture Darth Revan, then Voren becomes more likely to help them, as he believes that removing Revan would help him to rise through the ranks of the Sith. However, if either of the Jedi player characters are still conscious, Voren will not voluntarily help the players and remains hostile. If the players do succeed in gaining Voren's favor, he enters the code into the computer system and orders the security teams to move aft. However, if the player characters then decide to alter the ship's systems, for example by disabling the weapons or lowering the shields, Voren becomes hostile to them again. When the players leave the SecCom center, if Voren is still assisting them, he remains behind to ensure that the Sith security teams stay away from the flagship's bridge. If the players fail to obtain the code from Voren, they can get it by interrogating any surviving Sith troopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
