An ore world, Elphrona's terrain consisted of iron hills, as well as cliffs and mountains. It had an atmosphere that was breathable to several species, including humans, but had harsh conditions. Some regions of the planet were magnetized in such a way as to make air travel impossible in those areas, and the powerful magnetic field lines underlying this phenomena were a major factor in the formation of the planet's distinct topography. Rust storms were a known weather phenomenon. Locals considered any natural precipitation to be an exceedingly rare event, with as long as a decade between rains. However Elphrona had at least some natural bodies of water located in underground reservoirs and lakes far below its mineral rich surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Native fauna included chromants, steelees, and the canine creatures known as charhounds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Jedi activity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the High Republic Era, in a time of expanded Jedi activity throughout the galaxy, Elphrona was visited by the Jedi Order, who constructed an outpost within the side of a cliff.

Skywalker, intending to retrieve the artifacts for his new Jedi Order, encountered the Knights within the outpost. Skywalker confronted the Knights, refusing to allow them to take the artifacts.
