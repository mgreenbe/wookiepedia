A spacer working for Lieutenant Cope discovered the existence of the ryll smuggling ring of the Red Circle Gang and the location of the Ryll Smuggler Base. After the assassination of the mayor of Kor Vella Deel Draav by the Red Circle Gang, the CorSec raided the Ryll Smuggler Base. The spacer eliminated the underboss Ubis Reendorr and retrieved his access code for the Red Circle Base. The CorSec later assaulted the Red Circle Base nearby and killed most of the guards. The spacer used Reendorr's access code to slice the mainframe in the courtyard of the base and learned the identity of the three local Chirq Council leaders: Vella Corse, Vora Anjek and Annor Fash. The CorSec therefore attacked the basement of the Red Circle Base and killed the three leaders. During the assault, the spacer also discovered that the leaders of the Chirq Council were based in the city Doaba Guerfel. The CorSec investigation eventually led to the disbandment of the Chirq Council."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vella Corse was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
