Whilst undertaking the excavation, the crew broke into a chamber filled with dirt and a number of relics from the Galactic Civil War. Only one of these relics, a vault which contained The Rebel Files, a compilation of information penned by the Alliance to Restore the Republic, was deemed to possess significant military or intelligence value."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thus, The Rebel Files was then sent to the planetary governor, Vaxvissh Kal Ness, before the governor later sent it to the New Republic, since one of its most prominent figures, Leia Organa, was one of the few surviving high ranking Alliance members. Falling into the hands of Major Heck Ensio, the artifact was again given away to Master Archivist Mordianius, who would sent it to Commander Korr Sella of the Resistance, so that she may give it to General Leia Organa, leader of the Resistance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
