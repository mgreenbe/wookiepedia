However, in 2018, he stated that if he was given the opportunity, he would be glad to be part of it, commenting on the way fellow Star Trek actor Simon Pegg was completely unrecognizable in The Force Awakens and that there were ways and means to make a Star Wars appearance happen. Urban ended up portraying a stormtrooper in the 2019 film The Rise of Skywalker. According to the actor, he visited director J.J. Abrams while the latter was shooting the film and Abrams put him in a stormtrooper uniform, resulting in what the actor referred to as \"a really fun day on set\" for both of them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
