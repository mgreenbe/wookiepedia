Declared a thief and an enemy of Lady Valarian, Kavas Urdano tasked a spacer with killing Vos outside the city of Mos Eisley on Tatooine. When the spacer approached Vos, he insisted that the rations were poisonous, and that he wanted to bring the rations as proof to the authorities. Although he begged not to be killed, the spacer did so anyway, along with two fellow thugs who were defending him. The spacer returned the toxic rations to Urdano, who awarded the spacer with 2,000 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cie Vos was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because Cie Vos spawned under the generic \"jabba_thief\" template, his appearance was randomized under one of two possible depictions.
