It was also renowned for its expensive hand-woven tunics. It was the location of Bast Castle, a fortress used by Count Dooku, and later a place where Darth Vader studied the dark side of the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the fall of the Sith Empire, Vjun was one of the refuges for the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 4000 BBY, Viscountess Mireya of Vjun married into the Tapani nobility by wedding High Lord Tritum XI of House Mecetti.

The Viscount Malreaux performed experiments on midi-chlorians that drove the populace of Vjun insane, leading to their murder of each other in 29 BBY. One of the few survivors was the Viscountess Whirry Malreaux, who gave her son, Whie Malreaux, to the Jedi Order so he could escape the horrors of his birthworld. Whirry remained on Vjun with her Force familiar, the Vjun fox Miss Vix. Droids such as the FIII Footman droid and the R2-series astromech droid were used as the workhorses of the Vjun population as they were rather more resilient to the highly acidic climate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Vjun was located within Separatist space. In 20 BBY, Ch\u00e2teau Malreaux served as a hideout for Count Dooku in the Clone Wars. After taking over the ch\u00e2teau, he invited Jedi Master Yoda to come and save him from the dark side. In reality, Dooku had hoped to use the power of the dark side to destroy his former master. When Yoda arrived, he told Dooku to try and convert him to the dark side. Although Dooku told him of the wonders of the dark side, Yoda could not be turned and so Yoda tried to convert Dooku back to the light. This failed when Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker appeared and Dooku suspected treachery."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet later served as the headquarters of dark-side Executor Sedriss QL and Emperor Palpatine's elite forces of Dark Jedi.

Kam Solusar trained as a Dark Side Elite on Vjun before Luke Skywalker turned him to the light-side on Nespis VIII, six years after the Battle of Endor. Soon after, three Ysanna prisoners from Ossus were taken to Vjun to serve as raw material for creating new clone bodies of Emperor Palpatine. The Ysanna were frozen in carbonite to await the future construction of a clone laboratory within Bast Castle.

After a battle with Jaden Korr, Desann's former apprentice, Tavion Axmis, eventually came forth as the leader of the Disciples of Ragnos. However, she escaped with Rosh."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, in 22 ABY, the Jedi historian Tionne Solusar discovered that Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber had been recovered by Vader and stored at Bast Castle. Since an information broker had sold this information to them, she feared that others may have gotten to it first.

Having survived the fortress's automated defense systems and booby traps, they discovered the lightsaber in a protected alcove. Unfortunately, a group of mercenaries and pirates under a cloaked man named Orloc arrived. Orloc wielded a lightsaber and claimed to be a mage who possessed great powers. His henchmen also stole Kenobi's lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In response, the Jedi pursued Orloc and his henchmen on a chase through Bast Castle. During a confrontation, Orloc easily defeated Ikrit in lightsaber combat since the Kushiban had no lightsaber at all.

However, the other Jedi managed to rescue Uldir and escape Bast Castle, along with Kenobi's lightsaber and the holocron of the ancient Jedi Master Asli Krimsan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet would come under the control of the Yuuzhan Vong during their invasion of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vjun is mistakenly referred to as Djun in Star Wars: Dark Empire II.
