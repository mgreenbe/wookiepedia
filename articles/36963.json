Six months prior to the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, Maskar was among twelve pilots loaned to the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Sanction by the 204th's Colonel Shakara Nuress for a predicted Rebel Alliance attack on the Trenchenovu shipyards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the attack, Maskar's squadron ambushed the squadron of BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bombers which attempted a bombing run the shipyards, destroying all but one of them. Almost a month later, Maskar was killed by an explosion caused by sabotaged fuel piping supplied by Alliance sympathizers. Around six months later, Nath Tensent, the rebel survivor from the Trenchenovu shipyards, confronted Nuress during an attack on the 204th at the planet Pandem Nai. Wishing to find the names of the pilots who had killed his squadron, Tensent learned from Nuress that Maskar and the rest of them were already dead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Denn Maskar was first mentioned in the 2019 novel Alphabet Squadron, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
