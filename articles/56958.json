They had reptilian bodies, toothy beaks and flexible wings. The creatures typically nested in Greel trees in groups of four to eight, and were known to be very territorial. Their name derives from the screaming noises produced when their territory was disturbed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
