Skynx was a Ruurian academic and historian who became one of the galaxy's most distinguished scholars of pre-Republic history, particularly concerning the life of the ancient galactic dictator Xim the Despot. A faculty member at the University of Ruuria, Skynx became one of the most well-known \"Ximologists\" in the galaxy during the era of the Galactic Civil War, as he attempted to maximize the years he had before he exited his larval stage and metamorphosed into a mindless chroma-wing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1 BBY, Skynx was contacted to aid on a search for Xim's fabled treasure ship, the Queen of Ranroon, on which he linked up with Corellian smuggler Han Solo. Skynx's adventure took him to the Tion Hegemony world of Dellalt, and after a number of twists and turns, Skynx helped uncover the fabled treasure deep within Xim's treasure vaults. The Queen of Ranroon proved to be a career-making discovery, one that busied Skynx for the rest of his larval stage. Skynx eventually retired from his academic career as a renowned scholar, before returning home to Ruuria to live out the rest of his days as a chroma-wing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A very un-Ruurian adventure"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Scholar of Xim"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A native of the K'zagg Colony on the planet Ruuria, S. V. Skynx was a male member of the insectoid Ruurian species, a race with a unique life-cycle: Ruurians were only considered sentient during their initial, larval stage, eventually transforming in a chrysalis into simple-minded chroma-wings, who soared in the skies above Ruuria focused solely on mating."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point during his early years, Skynx went on a bad date to a Sullustan dinner theater where he first heard the chorus of the drama The Pirate Prince, which told the story of the conquests of the ancient pre-Republic galactic dictator known as Xim the Despot. The work filled Skynx with an overwhelming sense of joy, and sparked a lifelong fascination with Xim. That moment propelled Skynx towards a career as an academic, and by the era of the Galactic Civil War, Skynx was considered a ranking expert on pre-Republic history, with a focus on ancient languages."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Specifically, he turned the study of Xim into his life's work, as he scoured every corner he could in search of any fragments of Xim's history, including secreting away artifacts and antiques from the great library at Obroa-skai. Skynx's years of study made him one of the most well-known \"Ximologists\" in the galaxy, and resulted in a unique collection of artifacts, including the head of one of Xim's legendary Guardian Corps war droids\u2014believed to be possibly the only one that survived Xim's climactic defeat at the Third Battle of Vontor."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "An unexpected journey"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1 BBY, Skynx's expertise brought him to the attention of a man named Alexsandr Badure, a former contract laborer on the Tion Hegemony planet of Dellalt\u2014home to Xim's ancient treasure vaults\u2014who along with a partner named Hasti Troujow had discovered what they believed to be the log-recorder for Xim's long-lost treasure ship, the Queen of Ranroon. Skynx, by that point the chair of the Pre-Republic subdivision of the University of Ruuria's Human History subdepartment, jumped at the opportunity to search for the fabled ship, traveling to Rudrig to rendezvous with Badure and Troujow in person and from there travel to Dellalt, where the log-recorder was secreted within the vaults. Promised a half-share of the treasure in exchange for his assistance, Skynx met up with Badure, Troujow and their hired help, smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca, who flew the group to Dellalt on their freighter, the Millennium Falcon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skynx brought with him many of his Xim-related artifacts and datatapes, including his Guardian Corps head, which was studied breathlessly by Solo's two droid crewmen, Bollux and Blue Max. However, things didn't go as planned on Dellalt: upon attempting to retrieve the log-recorder from Xim's treasure vaults the crew was attacked by a group of thugs led by local criminal J'uoch, who had her own designs on the ancient treasure. Although Skynx provided valuable assistance in the ensuing firefight by scampering up a nearby utility pole and providing an aerial view of the attackers, J'uoch's gang forced the treasure hunters to flee, and stole Solo's Millennium Falcon. That forced Skynx and his compatriots into a long overland journey through the Dellalt mountains in order to retrieve the ship\u2014the group found that Skynx's Ruurian physiology lended him a climbing ability that proved invaluable as they scampered up endless cliffs. With their food running low, the group stumbled onto what appeared to be an abandoned shipyard high in the mountains, only for a quick examination to reveal the ships within to be fake. Skynx and his compatriots were subsequently rendered unconscious by a mysterious force, and awoke in a prison cell, with the two droids gone."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon their return, Bollux and Blue Max revealed that they were due to be made living sacrifices by the Survivors, an isolated, inbred culture of hill-dwellers directly descended from the survivors of Xim's honor guard. They used this information to escape\u2014Blue Max used his holoprojector to dazzle the Survivors with images of Xim before the ceremony began, giving the Falcon's crew the chance to make a break for it and narrowly evade pursuit by sliding down a mountain on a large gong."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The discovery of a lifetime"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon coming to a stop, the group found themselves in a gully in the foothills below J'uoch's mining camp, and followed a series of unusual radio signals to make a discovery that thrilled Skynx to his core: the legendary \"thousand guardians\" of Xim's Guardian Corps that were said to have been aboard the Queen of Ranroon, in formation and ready to fight. They were commanded by a Survivor that the Falcon's crew recognized as the assistant steward of Xim's treasure vaults, who ordered the droids to attack and destroy J'uoch and her gang."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With only desperate moments remaining before the marching horde of droids obliterated Solo's parked ship, Skynx followed his new friends into the fray as they navigated the battlefield. And while the insectoid academic was of little use in a firefight, his research was: having studied his tapes extensively, Blue Max was able to communicate with the Guardian Corps and order them onto a narrow bridge that collapsed and sent them crashing to their doom in a crevasse below. Interrogation of the droids' commander revealed that the Queen of Ranroon's bounty had been hidden within the treasure vaults all along. Back aboard the Millennium Falcon, they traveled back to where they started, only with one additional passenger: Gallandro, a famed gunman with his own personal grudge against Solo, who didn't want the Corellian out of his sight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skynx joined Solo and Gallandro as they delved into the treasure vaults, navigating deep into the complex's labyrinthine tunnels and ultimately finding the legendary treasure. However, Gallandro had no intent on sharing: having tracked Solo for light years, Gallandro drew on Solo and wounded him with a blaster shot, before pursuing Skynx deeper into the vaults. Thinking quickly, the Ruurian drew his pursuer into a no-weapons safety zone near the treasure stores, and removed the warning lights. When Gallandro pulled out his blaster, the complex's automated defense system turned the gunfighter into a cloud of ash."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Free to take stock of the Queen of Ranroon's fabled treasure, Skynx and his friends found something unexpected: it was nearly worthless in contemporary terms. The Queen of Ranroon was in fact filled with war materiel, items such as kiirium ingots that were commonplace in the present day but extremely valuable at the time. While Solo was disappointed at the lack of gold and gems, it was an archaeologist's dream find, including artifacts, art and datatapes that would greatly increase the level of historical knowledge of that time period. Awed and overjoyed at his discovery, Skynx hired Badure, Troujow, Bollux and Blue Max on the spot to assist in excavating and cataloguing the treasure, a project he expected to take the rest of his larval stage of life."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Subsequent career"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although nearly every surviving example of the Guardian Corps was destroyed in the collapse at J'uoch's mining camp, Skynx devoted himself tirelessly in the years to come to uncovering the droids' secrets and reconstructing their history. Meanwhile, the discovery of the Queen of Ranroon ultimately made Skynx's career. As the head researcher of the Dellalt Project, as it was known in archaeological circles, Skynx was recognized as one of the  galaxy's leading scholars of Xim-era history."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He went on to serve as one of the editors of the literary collection known as The Despotica. Sections of The Despotica edited by Skynx appeared in such anthologies as Ronton's Anthology to Galactic Literature, Vol. 2. He also maintained his respect for Solo, and published a re-telling of the discovery of the Queen of Ranroon titled Han Solo and the Lost Legacy: A True Story of the Scoundrel and a Scholar through the University of Rudrig Press. Skynx was later named the Emeritus Chair of the University of Ruuria's Department of History, and composed an oral history of the events surrounding the Queen of Ranroon's discovery. Badure was among the subjects interviewed for the work, which extensively discussed Solo's history and the meaning of the unique Corellian Bloodstripe he wore."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of his final works was a a Huttese-to-Basic translation of Direus'Pei's play Evocar, work Skynx completed with his cocoon already spun. Knowing his new life as a chroma-wing was calling, Skynx included a postscript to this work essentially bidding farewell to his old career, while wishing future Xim scholars good fortune. About 10 years after his career-altering discovery, Skynx left Xim behind and metamorphosed into a chroma-wing, interested only in reproducing: one of Skynx's offspring, Amisus, later served as the leader of the Unified Ruurian Colonies during the Caamas Document Crisis in 19 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Endlessly fascinated with pre-Republic history and especially with the life and times of the legendary Xim the Despot, S. V. Skynx's dedication to his field drove the Ruurian to become one of the galaxy's leading scholars on that historical epoch. Although he never truly understood exactly what it was about Xim's story that called to him so deeply, to him it was his life's purpose. His work cataloguing and uncovering Xim's mysteries kept Skynx going in the darkest times in his life, and also served as a much-needed distraction: when academic rivals received honors instead of him, or romantic endeavors went nowhere, Skynx could focus on his true passion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pragmatic, practical and pacifistic, which was customary for a Ruurian, Skynx began to experience a strong affinity for his fellow treasure-seekers during his adventure in the Tion, feeling acutely incomplete without them. He specifically held Han Solo in very high esteem for his audacity and ingenuity during their search for the Queen of Ranroon, a career-making achievement for the academic. Skynx held \"perpetual gratitude\" for Solo, which he expressed at every opportunity during his scholarly career. In addition to his talents as a researcher, Skynx was also a skilled musician, specializing in the traditional Ruurian instrument called the bellows horn\u2014due to his multi-limbed physiology, he could simultaneously play a flute, two tympanic pulsers, and two hammer-dulcimers to create a rich, layered sound on his own."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An average-sized Ruurian standing a little over one meter tall, Skynx moved on eight pairs of short limbs, had a thick amber coat with bands of brown and red, and had large, multifaceted red eyes. To Skynx, however, his Ruurian physiology was one of his greatest curses: he wished to put off his transformation into a chroma-wing for as long as possible, for that would be the end of his identity as Skynx. That desperation led him to travel with Solo, hoping to experience the Human concept of \"adventure\" before he metamorphosed. However, the hardships of his adventure gave Skynx a new appreciation for his old home, and in the final days of his larval stage, however, the call of the chrysalis became too great for Skynx to endure. At long last receiving another priority above his studies of Xim, Skynx finally came to terms with the destiny he once dreaded, wrapping up his scholarly pursuits and starting his new life as a chroma-wing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skynx first appeared in Han Solo and the Lost Legacy, a novel written by Brian Daley and released in 1980. Nearly 30 years after Skynx's appearance in Daley's novel, author Jason Fry gave his full name as \"S. V. Skynx\" in his 2009 Hyperspace-exclusive article \"Xim Week: The History of Xim and the Tion Cluster.\" The subsequent Hyperspace-exclusive series Xim Week: The Despotica contained several passages written from Skynx's perspective, giving additional information about the character's life, and the series' first part provided the first image of the character."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
