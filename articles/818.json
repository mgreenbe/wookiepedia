The barrel increased damage output and armor penetration of any weapon it was attached to but also increased maintenance requirements and downtime due to increased wear and tear on the barrel and frame. Only compatible with blaster rifles and heavy blaster rifles, the attachment was available during the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic following the Battle of Yavin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 234X was first mentioned in the Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2014."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
