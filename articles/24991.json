I'Zak is given a top-secret canister and is instructed to deliver it to the Republic camp several clicks to the east. On the way there, she is ambushed by several battle droids and super battle droids. After dispatching them, she soon stumbles across a squad of droidekas in a native village. Although the battle manages to break through the walls of one of the homes, the natives help I'Zak in defeating her droid foes. Before one of the droidekas is taken out, however, it manages to shoot off one last bolt, hitting the secret canister squarely in the middle and destroying it. I'Zak takes her anger out on a nearby team of super battle droids and later returns to the camp disappointed. She is surprised when Secura and Ki-Adi-Mundi reveal themselves, stating that I'Zak's mission was a complete success, as her real mission was to be a decoy as the two generals dealt with a top secret mission, which came directly from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Elsewhere, Count Dooku meets with the hologram of Darth Sidious. The count informs his master that the mission was a success and that Secura and Ki-Adi-Mundi had no clue their own mission was a diversion so that Dooku could successfully carry out his task. Sidious smiles, remarking that Dooku has learned the \"importance of carrying out orders\"... something that Ki-Adi-Mundi told I'Zak only moments before."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
