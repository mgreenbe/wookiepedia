When Ezra approaches, Kanan tells his Padawan that he has to take the lead in getting Hera back. When Ezra suggests that his master should take the lead, Kanan explains that his feelings for Hera may complicate the mission. Kanan tasks Ezra with planning the mission because they need to save Hera and everyone else."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, at the Dome, Governor Arihnda Pryce oversees the torture of Hera, who is being electrocuted.

When Grand Admiral Thrawn enters and asks whether she has revealed the location of the Rebel Fleet, Pryce replies that she hasn't begun asking questions yet while Hera screams in agony. Thrawn questions Hera but she remains defiant. Thrawn compliments her resolve and shows her family's Kalikori."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn tells Hera that he is interested in the deeper meaning of the things he collects. Thrawn deduces that the Kalikori is a significant symbol for his adversary. Thrawn surmises that the shapes on the Kalikori represent individuals important to her. He notices that one of the designs refers to a deceased loved one. Hera responds that he is unworthy of holding it. Thrawn replies that the Kalikori's legacy ends with her and that it will be appreciated by its new owner.

Zeb is growing impatient but Sabine shushes him. Ezra senses that Hera is in the \"Dome\" in Governor Pryce's office. Sabine adds that Pryce's office would be on the 157th level in block D. Zeb asks how they will get past all the patrols, gun turrets, and the watch towers. Ezra proposes flying in on gliders. Sabine supports Ezra's idea on the grounds that the Empire is equipped to counter sophisticated weaponry and targets and won't be looking for something low-tech like a glide. Zeb thinks this plan won't work but Ezra reassures them that his plan will work and that they can come in disguised as loth-bats."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ezra suggests that they land at the garbage chute in the south entrance of the Imperial complex.

Ryder Azadi, Mart Mattin, and Jai Kell watch the Spectres finishing the gliders. Ezra is about to call Kanan but Kanan is ready to join their mission to rescue Hera.

Thrawn says that the Emperor has promised that he supports the TIE Defender project. Tarkin admits that Krennic's project has been \"nothing more than expenses and excuses.\" He tells Thrawn that he has arranged a meeting with the Emperor for him to argue his case.

Hera jokes that the droid deserved it. After Kanan frees her, the two embrace and she jokes that she \"hates\" his hair. Kanan quips that it was the best he could do without a mirror. Kanan tells Hera that he has recovered her Kalikori as a present.
