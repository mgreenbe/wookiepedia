Owing to economic and legal restrictions, coupled with political repression, many chose to live beyond the civilizing grasp of the Core. Navigational beacons set up by Republic survey teams such as in the Tertiary Usaita system aided travelers heading towards the galactic periphery."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, tensions arose between the Republic and its Jedi allies over the warrior culture of the Outer Rim world of Mandalore, leading to a destructive conflict that ultimately saw the theft of the Darksaber from the Jedi Temple.

Though eventually trade and galactic commerce boomed between the Core and Outer Rim Territories, the Outer Rim was difficult to navigate and dangerous during the High Republic Era. Still, the current Supreme Chancellor, Lina Soh, sought to bring these outer worlds into the Republic and established outreach programs to do so. She also requested the Jedi Order expand its outreach as well, and Senator Izzet Noor of Serenno voiced the needs of the majority of the Outer Rim in the Galactic Senate. Traveling to the Outer Rim through hyperspace aboard transport ships like the Legacy Run, many settlers left the overpopulated Core and Colonies to make new lives for themselves, hoping to earn credits and make a future."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Part of the Outer Rim became known as the Galactic Frontier, which was also home to a guiding station known as Starlight Beacon. Even as Starlight was being constructed, the Outer Rim was considered a place of challenges; these challenges proved to be more deadly than exciting. Republic Judicial Forces and the Jedi Order enforced order throughout the galaxy, preventing a major galactic war for centuries. During the High Republic Era, the Republic Defense Coalition also helped patrol the Rim. Following the Great Hyperspace Disaster, the Outer Rim was effected by the Emergences, forcing Soh to blockade hyperspace routes into the Rim, which impacted many worlds in the region."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Fall of the Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several years before the Clone Wars, those in the Outer Rim eventually came to believe themselves victims of economic and social injustices, as Judicials were often withheld in intervening in Outer Rim affairs after many far-flung worlds refused to provide the Core with profitable deals. Harassed by numerous pirates and lacking protection from a federal military, the Outer Rim world of Eriadu formed the Outland Regions Security Force for the protection of the Seswenna sector. Funded by off-world loans and composed of an amalgam of ships, it received weapons from arms merchants who had for centuries been ignoring a Republic ban on the sale of weapons to member worlds. Initially lacking major success, it came to the forefront after Wilhuff Tarkin joined its anti-piracy task force, in which he was able to significantly reduce pirate raids throughout neighboring systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the monolithic Trade Federation slowly encroaching on the Outer Rim and the perceived weakness of Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum, who was already embroiled in numerous scandals and unable to bring the growing corruption in the Galactic Senate under control, Governor Tarkin of Eriadu turned Valorum from investigating a trade summit in an effort to weaken his authority.

This precipitated the Separatist Crisis, which would see thousands of worlds leave the Galactic Republic and join the growing Confederacy of Independent Systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the First Battle of Geonosis, the deadly three-year Clone Wars engulfed the galaxy and resulted in billions dead on both sides of the conflict. The Republic was forced to raise the Grand Army of the Republic to combat the Separatist threat, with the war finally ending following the Outer Rim Sieges and the death of the Separatist Council on Mustafar.

Believing control of the galaxy's outer systems would stabilize and secure the galactic center, Galactic Emperor Palpatine oversaw the buildup of the Imperial Military and ruthless quashing of dissent and remaining Separatist holdouts across the Outer Rim. Worlds such as Jelucan and Lothal saw Imperial occupation and development, often leading to rampant pollution and industrialization to support the Imperial war machine, while men and women were conscripted into the Imperial Army and Navy. A \"five-year plan\" was implemented for numerous Imperial-occupied worlds under the supervision of the Imperial Outer Rim High Command. In the farthest reaches of the Outer Rim, the Empire barely bothered to patrol its territory, and local citizens' militias took it upon themselves to protect friendly convoys."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Empire was never able to fully control the Outer Rim, but often utilized its worlds as testing grounds for new biological weapons and as a source of labor, brutally wiping out the Lasat species of the Outer Rim world of Lasan, exploiting the native Twi'lek species of Ryloth by rounding up native villagers for slave labor, and murdering nearly all the Geonosians."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Seeking to embody the spirit of the Tarkin Doctrine, the Empire oversaw the construction of the first Death Star over Geonosis and exterminated the native Geonosian population. Grand Moff Tarkin was tasked with imposing order in the Outer Rim Territories, being promoted to Governor of the Outer Rim. After limiting the HoloNet of various Outer Rim worlds to Imperial use five years after the formation of the New Order, many dissatisfied systems viewed the embargo as the unofficial start of the Imperial conquest of the Outer Systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 10 BBY, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Qi'ra, Tobias Beckett, and the droid L3-37 disrupted a Pyke Syndicate spice mining operation on Kessel during a mission to acquire coaxium for the Crimson Dawn crime lord Dryden Vos.

This rebel network posed a major threat to the Imperial Ruling Council[source?] and established bases on the worlds of Dantooine and Yavin 4. The Rebellion won its first victory against the Galactic Empire at the Battle of Scarif, which resulted in the theft of the Death Star plans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Emperor dissolved of the Imperial Senate, regional governors were given direct control over their territories.

Due to its distance from the Core, unauthorized holofeeds operated in abundance in the Outer Rim, owing in part to the Empire's tentative control of the region. During this time, the Empire launched a crackdown on the Outer Rim to eliminate criminal syndicates save for those allied with the Empire, such as the Hutts, who Darth Vader had negotiated with for resources. This included an attack on the the Cymorah sydicate which had been stealing from the Empire. Vader led forces to attack a station which resulted in its destruction. Son-tuul Pride base which was led by Vader and resulted in the seizure of the base and credit hoards from the group as well as the death of the leader, Yonak's father. The Son-tuul-Pride would later be briefly reorganized under 0-0-0 before dissolved after the Empire later launched another attack led by Lieutenant-Inspector Magna Tolvan that decimated them. Many of the Empire's funding was going towards the construction of Super Star Destroyers. Some of it also helped enrich the Hutts although this was simply a side effect. A lot of crime events took place in the Anthan system which led to fighting between criminals and the Empire. After the Son-tuul robbery Vader and Thanoth worked their to find those responsible, although Vader was secretly responsible so he worked to cover it up. On Anthan Prime there was a droid fighting den and the Empire raided it where Vader and Inspector Thanoth captured Doowan who gave them the location the Dragons den on Anthan 13 where Vader killed him. They used his data to find the Ante who was a major figure who sold information. Vader and Thanoth led a raid which resulted in the death of the Ante. Vader and Thanoth later attacked a rebel group on Anthan 1 and destroyed them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Mid Rim Retreat, the Empire discovered the Rebellion's new base on Hoth, destroying it in the Battle of Hoth and splintering the Rebellion into fragments spread across the Outer Rim. Following Operation Ringbreaker, roughly six months after the Battle of Hoth, Operation Yellow Moon allowed the scattered Rebel Fleet to converge over Sullust to strike on the Empire's new Death Star under construction over Endor. Its destruction in the Battle of Endor, as well as the deaths of the Emperor and Darth Vader, saw the fragmentation of Imperial authority, resulting in the gradual retreat of Imperial dominion from the Outer Rim."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "New Republic Era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The New Republic, the government formed by the Rebel Alliance, admitted Akiva as the first Outer Rim world to formally join the Republic in the months after Endor. By 5 ABY, the Empire had lost control of much of the Outer Rim with the exception of Zhadalene, Korrus, and Belladoon.  Many crime groups took advantage of this chaos to rise. Under the orders of Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax, the Empire nationalized the Imperial weapons and vehicular factories there for the war effort. In coordination with Imperial fleets hidden in the Vulpinus Nebula, the Almagest, the Recluse's Nebula, the Queluhan Nebula, the Ro-Loo Triangle, and the Inamorata, Rax planned to use the three Outer Rim holdouts as a cord to strangle the New Republic. Shortly before the Battle of Jakku, Princess Leia Organa reported that Tatooine and Horuz were in the thrall of some Imperial remnant, criminal syndicates or gangsters.

The Empire was pushed back to a handful of sectors in the fringe of the Outer Rim, and although they only contained a small fraction of the galaxy's population and industrial base, they were nevertheless a heavily fortified final redoubt. As a result, the New Republic deemed that they posed too minor of a threat to justify the high cost in life that liberating them would require, and the Empire surrendered to the the New Republic and signed a treaty ending the war. The Republic then began arriving in the remaining Imperial sectors to announce the signing of the treaty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Jakku, the Outer Rim was very lawless as the New Republic didn't do much to control it. Due to this it was common a place for Imperial remnants like Moff Gideon's to hide, with bases on planets like Nevarro. The world of Tatooine had changed very much by 9ABY.

However, organized crime later returned to the Gaulus sector and adversely affected the economy of Ryloth due to the indecisiveness of the Galactic Senate. One major crime syndicate was the Nikto crime lord Rinnrivin Di's cartel, which was based on Bastatha. Rinnrivin's smuggling activities took a toll on Ryloth's economy and precipitated a New Republic senatorial investigation led by Organa and Ransolm Casterfo. In truth, Rinnrivin's cartel was a criminal front organization set up by several Centrist senators including Lady Carise Sindian to bankroll the Amaxine warriors and the First Order's fleet. The planet Daxam IV was the site of an Amaxine base which housed a thousand Amaxine warriors. The Amaxines were a militia that was led by former Imperial officers like Arliz Hadrassian, who admired the Old Empire and sought to overthrow the New Republic.
