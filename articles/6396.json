They were thus lethal to most oxygen-breathers and many species would not utilize these weapons. However, since many Gand races were ammonia-breathers, Gand bounty hunters would use ammonia bombs if necessary. Zuckuss, one such Gand bounty hunter, was notable for his usage of ammonia bombs, which he would often hide up his sleeves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
