Staven used to run with the Red Star Ring; looking young and frail, Staven was given a stun cloak as part of a scam the criminal group ran. Staven would pretend to be the victim of an attack, and when someone came to help them, the rescuer was zapped with the stun cloak. Staven would then relieve them of their credit voucher. Staven also left comments on Datalog entries, including the Model RDP-12 Rocket Launcher."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
