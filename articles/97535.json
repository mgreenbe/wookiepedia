When the Minions of Xendor settled on Kashi, they named two lightsaber styles after the double trio: Form VI: Niman and the dual blades technique Jar'Kai. Jar'Kai was called \"Niman\" because it used two blades, just as there were two trinities. Form VI was called Niman because the two trinities made up a total of six gods."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
