Colored red on their limbs and gray on their bodies, crab-harps could lock their limbs in an extended position so that the tendons were stretched tight; in this position, the crustacean resembled a type of harp.

There, the creatures made music as Yuuzhan Vong Warmaster Tsavong Lah tortured the captured Leia Organa Solo, a representative of the New Republic. Later in the war, crab-harps were used to provide music as part of a grand ceremony that took place in the Place of Sacrifice on the captured world of Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Crab-harps first appeared in the novel The New Jedi Order: Balance Point, released in 2000 and written by Kathy Tyers. Balance Point was a part of The New Jedi Order series of books. Crab-harps were later mentioned in The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force, by James Luceno, and also received an entry in 2008's The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia. Crab-harps were also mentioned in the 131st installment of The Official Star Wars Fact File. However, the Fact File incorrectly describes that two crab-harps were connected with their tendons to another drum creature to create a large musical instrument. As all of the other sources describe the crab-harp as not being attached to the drum creature, this article assumes that the Fact File is in error. The Essential Reader's Companion, published in 2013, is the only source to date to show a picture of a crab-harp."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
