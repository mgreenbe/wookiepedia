However, following the sabotage of the project at the hands of Darth Maladi of the One Sith and her ally, the rogue Yuuzhan Vong Shaper Zenoc Quah, it became the center of Maladi's and Quah's further experiments with Vong biots."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maladi captured Deliah Blue and locked her in a Yuuzhan Vong Embrace of Pain. She also had Deliah implanted with a malevolent Vong biot on her back as a means of luring Cade Skywalker into a trap. He would then be used as a test subject for her experiments in creating a new weapon for the future Dark Lord of the Sith. In the ensuing skirmish, Cade and his companions managed to penetrate the lab, which prompted Quah to unleash his experimental biots."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quah was killed during the fighting and the complex was destroyed by Maladi, who activated the remote detonation set in an attempt to kill Skywalker and his companions. With Fionah Ti's inexplicable inability to stop the countdown despite her familiarity with Vong technology, Cade's companions fled while he used the light side of the Force to heal Deliah of the biot's effects, and to shield them from the explosion. With the lab's destruction, the Sith attempt to trap Skywalker failed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
