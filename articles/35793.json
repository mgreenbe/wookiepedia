They were similar in appearance to their insect brethren, however they possessed tougher armor that could endure high temperatures, as well as the ability to breathe short streams of fire. Deadly laigreks were found in the subterranean areas of the hilly regions of the planet, however by 3951 BBY, a number of them had migrated to the sublevel of the bombed-out Jedi Enclave."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
