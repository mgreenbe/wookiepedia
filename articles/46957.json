Produced by Kuat Drive Yards, the Far Orbit was initially helmed by Imperial Captain Vocis Kenit as it hunted down pirates in the Outer Rim Territories. However, due to Kenit's tyrannical leadership, his second-in-command Commander Dhas Fenoep Vedij\u2014who had become disillusioned with the Empire\u2014led a successful mutiny in 0 ABY against Kenit and the Imperial forces aboard the frigate. After discharging the Imperial-aligned crew members and those who refused to enlist with the Rebel Alliance, Vedij had the Far Orbit travel to the space station StarForge Station, where it picked up replacement crew members and joined up with the Alliance. The Far Orbit thus became a privateering vessel for the Alliance in the Ringali Shell of the Core Worlds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon afterwards, the Far Orbit captured the Imperial escort frigate New Star and Shipment 1037, an entire convoy of freighters, after leading them into a trap with the help of an Alliance task force. The privateers then detained Imperial Advisor Coh Veshiv near the planet Esseles after convincing Veshiv to transfer over to the Far Orbit from the CR90 corvette Empire Forever by claiming that the Far Orbit would be used as Veshiv's next vessel. Following Veshiv's capture, Kenit\u2014tasked by the Empire with tracking down his old ship\u2014manipulated the Far Orbit into a confrontation with the Solar Terrors pirate group. However, Vedij and the privateers emerged victorious from that battle. Kenit later caught up to the Far Orbit using the transport SPF 14897 as bait; when the Far Orbit raided SPF 14897, Kenit's task force pounced on the frigate. In the resulting battle, the privateers escaped only after knocking out one of the gravity wells of the Imperial Interdictor Claw, allowing the Far Orbit to jump to hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the heavily damaged Far Orbit was repaired, the frigate once more returned to the Ringali Shell and went to the world Brentaal IV. There, a landing party from the Nebulon-B picked up a datadisc containing important information about the route of the Imperial Star Galleon-class frigate Emperor's Will, which was carrying a very valuable cargo of treasures. While attempting to capture the frigate, the Far Orbit was engaged by the Claw again after it dragged the ship from hyperspace near the Ringali Nebula, though the privateers managed to escape once more. Vedij and his crew then proceeded to attack the Emperor's Will and its escort, the Zaff Jendinpurg, after forcing them out of hyperspace. Dispatching the escort, the Far Orbit seized the frigate's cargo pod after the Emperor's Will's captain ejected it from the ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "General information"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Far Orbit was a EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate, produced by Kuat Drive Yards and measuring 300 meters in length. As a Nebulon-B, the starship's main section was at the fore of the craft, with a thin boom module connecting the fore to the aft propulsion section. At full capacity, the Far Orbit's crew numbered 854 with sixty-six additional gunners, though the escort frigate\u2013class ran on a skeleton crew of 307 hands and ten gunners if need be. However, running on a less-than-full crew resulted in decreased combat efficiency, and in that situation, certain unused sections of the ship were closed off to conserve the ship's energy. In addition to crew, the Far Orbit could house seventy-five passengers, which were usually troops, while its storage compartments could hold up to six thousand metric tons worth of cargo and up to four months' worth of consumables. For every fifty cubic meters of cargo space, a hundred tons of cargo could be held."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The propulsion module was the site of the Far Orbit's static discharge vanes, which were used to vent dangerous excess amounts of energy in the ship's engines. The discharge function was not used regularly, as doing so was only necessary in certain situations such as combat or ion storms. The vanes were mounted on the outer hull of the frigate, and if they were damaged or lost, the reactor could potentially melt down if energy built up to dangerous amounts, or the fuel system could explode. There were two turbolift shafts located in the Far Orbit: one in the forward module and one in the propulsion. Each shaft had two cars and spanned multiple floors. However, the turbolifts were not continuously in service and, for security reasons, did not go to every deck. Additionally, any turbolift could be overridden by the rank cylinder of an officer, which would cause it to ignore calls from other decks. Most traffic between decks on the frigate was done via hatches with ladders that went from one level to the next."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Basic crew quarters existed on Deck 5, in the command module. These quarters had limited entertainment options and only common refreshers to service the crew there. The triple-bunk crew quarters only housed average-sized Humans, though modifications could be made to fit larger beings. The trooper quarters were also situated in the command module between the main crew quarters, the officer quarters, and the bridge. This was intended to halt or hamper the efforts of a mutiny by preventing mutineers from reaching the bridge or the officers. Additionally, since all of the frigate's docking facilities were above the trooper quarters, the trooper quarters stood between potential boarders and the bridge. The standard trooper quarter, which meant to house two squads, was comprised of a pair of rooms, with the larger one filled with double bunk beds and the smaller one with a common refresher."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Officer quarters were situated under the trooper and the main crew quarters in the command module. All of the officer quarters, whether they were for junior officers or senior officers, had a small entertainment console, pre-made meals, and a low-quality autochef which dispensed hot and cold drinks. The quarters for the ship's engineers were housed in the propulsion module. These rooms were similar to the quarters for officers and standard hands that were located in the command module, though they were dirtier, due to the tools and materials that the engineers handled and sometimes brought back to their quarters. The standard engineer quarter featured two rooms, with the larger walled with triple bunk beds, some storage, an A/V unit, and a workbench. Privacy curtains were also featured in the room, and the other room was a basic refresher. The common engineer officer quarter had three rooms, with a pair of identical rooms mirroring each other and separated by a refresher unit. The identical rooms each had a double bunk near the door to the refresher and a closet, desk, and A/V unit on the wall opposite to the refresher. Both non-refresher rooms also had a workbench, which was opposite the A/V unit, and a privacy curtain that concealed the bed from sight if one sat at the workbench. The crew of the deflector shield generator was also kept in the propulsion module for increased combat readiness."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Equipment, complement, and armaments"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sensor arrays of the Far Orbit were housed in the ship's Sixth Section, and it was there that the sensor computer, sensor technicians, and operators were located. The sensor computer correlated the data received by the sensors, which acted as the eyes and ears of the vessel, and also recorded and reported on that same data. The computer could then make a sophisticated analysis on a variety of subjects based on the data it received. The frigate possessed both a forward and an aft sensor unit, which, because the Far Orbit was an EF76 Nebulon-B, were of excellent quality. The frigate had one of the most sensitive long-range sensor arrays in the entire Imperial fleet and possessed a full range of sensors. These included standard electro photo receptors, full spectrum transceivers, dedicated energy receptors, and lifeform indicators. Additionally, the Far Orbit had hyperwave signal interceptors and the rarer crystal gravfield traps. The crystal gravfield traps were used to detect and find cloaked or stealthy ships, and dark objects. Hyperwave signal interceptors were used for long-range scans and were able to find the vector of a ship entering or exiting hyperspace after detecting them. After the vector was found, it was possible for the astrogation section of the ship to uncover its destination. The hyperwave signal interceptors were also used to catch hypertransceiver and subspace transceiver signals, which, after being intercepted, were sent to Primary Communications on Deck 1 for decryption."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to the mutiny that occurred on the Far Orbit, the frigate had several shuttles and two squadrons of TIE/LN starfighters as its complement; however, the Far Orbit lost its entire fighter complement in its engagement with the Silent Blades pirate gang. Additionally, after the mutiny, many of the Imperial loyalists were sent off the ship in the frigate's shuttles, leaving only a pair of craft for the Far Orbit. One was a Grek-class troop shuttle, and the other a Katarn-class boarding shuttle. Over the course of its privateering days after the mutiny, the frigate added to its complement with various starfighters and shuttles that it acquired. The Nebulon-B was externally armored all over her hull, and the amount of armoring varied from place to place. In addition, the ship was defended by the capabilities of a Delphus JC-671 deflector shield projector, which protected the ship from most space debris and made the Far Orbit tough enough to engage in combat. The shield generator was located off the main propulsion module so as to avoid the threat of the generator's explosive reaction to being breached. The shield generator was quite powerful and used up great amounts of energy when the Far Orbit was in a space battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In terms of armaments, the frigate had twelve turbolaser cannons, twelve smaller laser cannons, and a pair of tractor beam projectors that were suited to combat purposes. Half of the turbolaser batteries were located at the front of the Far Orbit, with three more on each side. The laser cannons were positioned with six to the front, two on each side, and a pair at the aft of the frigate. Crewed by a dozen hands, the two combat tractor beam projectors were at the front of the ship. The laser cannons and the turbolasers ran off the same power system and blaster gas canisters, though they did consume spare gas tanks and power cells in combat situations in order to dampen the impact of destroying one of the weapons emplacements. The turbolasers were the main fighting guns of the ship, and despite being not overly powerful, they were quite damaging when used together. The laser cannons, on the other hand, were not powerful and only proved effective when used in concert. Both the laser cannons and the turbolasers had a minimum range of between two and six meters, a medium range of twenty-four meters, and a maximum range of fifty meters in a planet's atmosphere."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though the guns of the Far Orbit were located all over the vessel, the primary weapons were located in the Seventh Section of the ship. It had the most cannons and was the first place to receive targeting orders, and because of this, the other guns followed the primary weapons' fire. The Seventh Section also held the main weapon power processing units, the targeting computers, and the central blaster gas tanks, which were heavily armored to avoid explosions. In the event of the blaster tanks exploding, the cannons of the EF76 were still able to operate because they all operated on battery power, and all had their own reserve of blaster gas. The gunnery stations of the frigate were sparsely lit in order to prevent glares on targeting scopes. They also echoed with the rumble of the weapon's testing routines, as the stations were located near the Far Orbit's outer hull, and thus were poorly insulated against noise. The gunners of the cannons handled all of the aiming and firing of the weapons via the targeting data that the ship's sensors collected. Although the bridge of the Far Orbit usually gave out firing commands, some captains let the gunners pick and choose their targets. Because the turbolasers were wired directly to the main reactor, located in the propulsion module, they kept up a constant rate of fire as long as there was enough blaster gas for them to use."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The majority of blaster gas on the Far Orbit was stored in canisters that were one meter tall and a third of a meter in diameter. These canisters weighed 110 kilograms, and each had enough gas to supply a laser cannon with sufficient energy to fire twenty capital-scale shots. If set to smaller-scale blaster shots, which were designed to take out starfighters, the canisters held enough gas to fire forty. To reload a cannon, the gunner had to lift up the canister to the cradle that was connected to the cannon's power supply system. The cradle was then \"rammed\" into the main cannon, and the gunner broke the seal on the canister by operating a control on his or her status panel. The main tractor beams ran off the main power grid and had no expendable ammunition. They were used for securing an enemy ship and reeling it in so the Far Orbit's guns had more control, or to help with boarding. These tractor beams had a minimum range of two to ten meters, a medium range of thirty meters, and a maximum range of sixty meters. In addition to the two combat tractor beams, the Far Orbit had several non-combat tractor beams which were positioned in the ship's TIE fighter flight deck, in each docking bay, and in the boarding bay. These non-combat tractor beams, each crewed by three men, served the purpose of stabilizing docking ships, bringing in both TIE starfighters and shuttles, and helping with boarding actions by securing the enemy ship to the Far Orbit."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Decks of the ship"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Deck 1"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Deck 1 of the Far Orbit housed Primary Communications, and it fell under the Aft First Section, which was located at the top portion of the Nebulon-B's forward module. The Primary Communications deck, nicknamed PrimeComm or P-Com, was the home of the ship's long-range subspace transceiver, which had a range of over a hundred light-years. Due to the fact that the Far Orbit was meant to serve as a capital ship on missions, the frigate possessed a pair of communication arrays, one for contacting local frequencies and the other for use in long-range transmissions. The communications computer that processed all of the signals was a powerful and highly advanced TerexComm processor unit that was located in a room at the aft of the deck on the port side. The processor boasted multi-channel sorting and high-speed channel switching, as well as full programming in encryption and decryption. With the processor unit, comm techs could tap into secure transmissions and listen for information."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the front of the Primary Communications section was a pair of rooms used for encryption and coding, as well as a secure comm room that featured a holoprojector, viewscreen, and several seats.

The galley was run and organized by a few hands, and it possessed some cooking and serving droids. With the kitchen and serving area located at the front of the crew galley, hands came in through the front and, after receiving their meal, proceeded to the tables in the dining room aft of the kitchen and serving area. To each side of the kitchen were pantries and autochefs, the latter of which were connected to the main kitchen via under-deck feeds.

The forward section of the bay housed some of the Far Orbit's shuttle craft, including the captain's shuttle. As the bay could sometimes be a tight fit, wider ships and freighters relied on the docking tubes instead. Docking Bay 2 was used to unload supplies for the propulsion module, and also served as a repair bay.

The sick bay, or the medical facilities, was able to treat all normal injuries and illnesses that crew members might suffer. Led by the Far Orbit's doctor, a small amount of Human medical assistants and an entire complement of MD-series medical specialist droids helped treat wounds and maladies. The medical facilities' standard procedure regarding bacta treatment required that the patient be stabilized before treatment. A limited number of functional and inorganic-looking cybernetic limbs and prosthetics were available to the sick bay, though some additional ones could be assembled with a day's notice.

Additionally, the MD-0 took care of emergency triage during combat situations and played the role of the MD-5's aid when the other ran checkups on crew members. An MD-3 medical droid managed the sick bay's eight bacta tanks and also ran the pharmacy.

This option draws lots of Imperial attention because of the Far Orbit's victory, and a whole fleet, including some Star Destroyers, is sent after the privateers. This causes StarForge Station to bar them from restocking there in order to avoid detection by the Imperials. The article does not choose either of the latter two possibilities because the first prevents the Alliance from helping them again, while the second is highly unlikely and sends more Imperials after them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There is one more possibility: the Far Orbit disables the Claw to escape. This is the option that this article uses, as it does not harm any of the Far Orbit's later adventures. There is an extension to the path where the frigate takes out the Interdictor's gravity wells, involving the Nebulon-B using its tractor beams to maneuver the enemy fighters into a collision with the weapons of the Claw, and then using the crippled ship as a shield against enemy fire. However, this part of the option is avoided because it would seriously damage or destroy the Claw, which appears later in canon in the 1999 video game Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Raid on Brentaal"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sixth scenario, Raid on Brentaal, has the least path deviations out of all the other adventure ideas. The ship that the privateer landing party uses to go to Brentaal IV from the Far Orbit can be a shuttle, but the scenario suggests that it is a freighter. The scenario itself can be changed into a privateer-only mission by the gamemaster if he or she deems it so, with the crew researching the planet before making a small base of operations there. They thereafter acquire the information that is on the datadisc in the normal adventure via a slicer and flee the world. However, since the scenario contains a much more detailed telling of the Alliance and the privateering mission, this article presumes that that path is taken."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Hunter/Hunted"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The seventh adventure idea, dubbed Hunter/Hunted, is short and tells of the Far Orbit's encounter with the Claw in the Ringali Nebula. In the case that the Claw was destroyed in its earlier encounter near Brentaal IV with the privateers, a different Interdictor pulls them out instead. As the Claw was featured in X-Wing Alliance, this is not considered canon. There are two main paths that can be taken. The first involves the one that this article selects, which is where the Far Orbit flees to the nebula. Once there, the frigate can escape to hyperspace or try to board the Interdictor via a shuttle. The boarders seize the Imperial vessel's bridge before using stun gas to take out the crew, while the stormtroopers are also dealt with. This would leave the Claw under the privateers' control and would be beneficial for future raids. However, as the Claw is in Imperial possession in X-Wing Alliance, this path is not considered canon. A totally different option is to assault the Claw right after the privateers are pulled from hyperspace. Because they have a superior crew, the Far Orbit manages to neutralize the threat of the Interdictor, and it escapes before Imperial reinforcements arrive. However, as it is very unlikely that the Nebulon-B would be able to pull this off, this article does not utilize this path."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Grand Prize"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The last of the scenarios is The Grand Prize, in which the Far Orbit attempts to capture the Emperor's Will. In this scenario, as the privateers do not want to destroy the treasure in the cargo pod by blowing away the Star Galleon, the Emperor's Will must be neutralized. Options include precision fire against the engines of the Imperial ship, ion cannon fire against the main hull if the Far Orbit has acquired those, or even attaching the Far Orbit to the Imperial frigate with its tractor beams to prevent it from escaping. It is also possible for the players to deliver the ion charge via starfighters if they have acquired them in their prior raids. The Emperor's Will can also be boarded if the players wish to do so, but the stormtroopers will resist the intrusion; The Far Orbit Project itself states that if the gamemaster wishes to kill Vedij off, as this is the last adventure scenario, the boarding would be an ideal place to do so, as long as the death is heroic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, it doesn't matter much how the Emperor's Will is neutralized, as it still releases its cargo pod. As a result, this article does not choose one of the options as the best one, and the canon one, though the boarding possibility with Vedij dying is not considered one of the better options. Once the cargo pod is launched, the gamemaster can choose to have Imperial vessels arrive on the scene and delay the privateers long enough for the pod to make an emergency jump to hyperspace. The Far Orbit must then elude an Imperial task force that is dispatched in search of the Emperor's Will, which is led by a Star Destroyer, as the privateers try to find the pod and then disable its tracking device so the Imperial forces cannot track it. The frigate can then seize the pod with its tractor beams before attempting to open it. However, this article presumes that the gamemasters is not so mean as to send Imperial ships to prevent the privateers from seizing the loot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the players try to open the cargo pod, it can be booby-trapped with fragmentation explosives, highly charged electrical locks, or antipersonnel blasters. For each of the players' failure to open the pod, a boarder is killed. Gamemasters can change the contents of the cargo pod and, subsequently, their total value to align with the scale of the Far Orbit's campaign and the players' preferences.

They can either raid its supplies that are delivered by small freighters, or attack the station itself with a team of boarders disguised as Imperial troops or staff in order to steal the facility's starfighters and supplies. Who Is The More Foolish? has the privateers conducting raids against Station 1B6/Green, a Bavos-II heavy-duty military space platform, so that the Victory I-class Star Destroyer Scourge would be drawn away from the world of Ralltiir, allowing the Alliance forces there to slip more blockade runners through."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Smash the Scourge involves the Far Orbit committing small raids against 1B6/Green until the Scourge is actively chasing the privateers. Once this has happened, Vedij lures the Star Destroyer to a prearranged ambush site, where an Alliance task force tries to capture the Scourge. However, all three of these scenario hooks have the Far Orbit giving up its cover as an Imperial escort frigate, which directly contradicts The Capture of Veshiv, in which the Far Orbit loses its cover. Another scenario hook that is not considered canon is Never Raid An XTS Freighter, in which Vedij and the privateers deal with the consequences of seizing a ship owned by Xizor Transport Systems. Some of these consequences include Puullo reneging on his promises to the Far Orbit, StarForge Station not allowing them to dock there, and teams of mercenaries and thugs pursuing the Nebulon-B."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
