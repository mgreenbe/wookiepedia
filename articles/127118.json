A popular urban environment sport, personal skimming with a sky slicer was called \"sky slicing.\" Racers kept their balance with magboots. While not the fastest swoops, sky slicers were the most maneuverable. A low-frequency tractor beam generator mounted on the rear allowed for the towing of a passenger in an optional \"drogue slicer,\" which was equipped for its own lift but no independent forward momentum."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A popular model was the Sky Striker 5000."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
