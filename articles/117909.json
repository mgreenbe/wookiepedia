Inspired by the concept of a Force dyad, the rule mandated that only two Sith Lords could exist at any given time: a master to represent the power of the dark side of the Force, and an apprentice to train under the master and to one day fulfill their role. The philosophy of two governed the Lords of the Sith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Even before Darth Bane created the rule, the Sith doctrines still rotated somewhat around the idea of a pair of Force-users. The masters demanded loyalty from their apprentices, but they sometimes betrayed them if they found one with more potential. In ancient times, the Sith were often ruled by two Dark Lords while many others existed at the same time."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Creation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Order and Sith Order were bitter adversaries for millennia. Eventually, the Sith's greed for power caused them to turn on themselves, which allowed the Jedi to defeat and decimate the weakened Sith a millennium before the Clone Wars. However, Darth Bane emerged as the sole surviving Sith Lord. Realizing that the Sith's greed led to their destruction, Bane created the Rule of Two, to allow the Sith to operate in secret and prevent them from being destroyed by their own greed again. Bane also created the rule so that the Sith could eventually gain enough power to take revenge on the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bane developed the philosophy after his personal experiences, by studying ancient Sith documents and to succeed the older, purer doctrine of the dyad in the Force, a unique Force-bond strong as life itself between two Force-sensitive individuals. In comparison to the dyad, the Rule of Two was a pale imitation, an unworthy but necessary successor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under the Rule of Two, a Sith apprentice had to kill the Sith Master in order to ascend the dark side of the Force, ensuring that the Sith grew more powerful and cunning with each generation. On the other hand, the master could train another student, and have them replace and kill the outgoing student. As a result, the relationship between the master and the apprentice lacked trust, as both constantly searched for signs of weakness in the other."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bane took an apprentice of his own, Darth Zannah, and passed on his knowledge while establishing the new Sith way of pursuing power and revenge against the Jedi through manipulation and subterfuge. The Jedi became aware of Bane's philosophy and Bane was killed. Although historical records weren't accurate, it was considered possible that Bane was killed by his own apprentice. In either case, the Jedi went on to falsely believe that they had destroyed the Sith forever. However, Bane's plans continued through his apprentice, allowing the Sith to survive secretly for years while planning their revenge against the Jedi Order. Rumors, nevertheless, remained that the Sith continued in the shadows. The Rule of Two created a powerful dynamic by limiting the Sith to only one master and one apprentice at a time, although not all Sith followed the rule as some took apprentices of their own while still serving a master."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Plagueis and Sidious"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith carried out their vendetta for a thousand years, gaining power in secret while the Jedi still believed that the Sith had been destroyed. During this period, the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Plagueis took Darth Sidious, the Sith persona of Senator Sheev Palpatine of Naboo, as his apprentice. They worked for years to coax the final secrets from the dark side of the Force. Sidious called back on the wisdom of Plagueis as a planner and a prophet, knowing full well that two Sith were required to enact their means; one to serve as bait for the dark side, the other to be the vessel. Success would allow them the ability to harness the full power of the dark side and rule immortal for ten thousand years."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Sidious and Maul"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While training under Plagueis, Sidious acquired a Dathomirian Zabrak named Maul as his pupil. He had initially considered Mother Talzin, Maul's mother, to be his Sith apprentice, but took Maul upon realizing his potential. Seeing no further use for his master, Sidious killed Plagueis in his sleep."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After killing his first Jedi, the Twi'lek Padawan Eldra Kaitis, Maul reflected that she would have made a good Sith apprentice, but that he had to finish her off to prevent his master from discovering his intended betrayal. Concurrently, Xev Xrexus from the Xrexus Cartel theorized the Sith's comeback, leading Maul to kill her as Sidious threatened him with death if they were prematurely discovered."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 32 BBY, during the Invasion of Naboo by the Trade Federation, the Sith finally revealed themselves to the Jedi with Sidious sending Maul to Tatooine to capture Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala and take her back to Naboo so she could sign a peace treaty. The Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn faced Maul but was able to leave Tatooine with Amidala and his allies, realizing that the Sith had returned. During the Battle of Naboo, which broke the Federation's blockade, Maul killed Jinn only to be seemingly killed in turn by Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi, leading the Jedi to realize the return of the Sith."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Sidious and Tyranus"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Maul gone, Sidious took the former Jedi Master Count Dooku from House Serenno as his next apprentice and bestowed him the name Darth Tyranus. During a mission on Sullust, Dooku considered recruiting the Jedi Knight Jak'zin as an ally to the Sith cause, but ultimately stopped when Sidious stated that a Sith Master needed only one apprentice and threatened to replace him with the Togorian Jedi. During the next decade, Dooku aided his master in engineering the Clone Wars, including orchestrating Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas' death, and then to use his name to order an army of clones to be created for the Republic and selecting bounty hunter Jango Fett as the genetic template for the clones. In 22 BBY, with the Confederacy of Independent Systems on their side, Dooku revealed his new allegiance to the Jedi and the Clone Wars began with the First Battle of Geonosis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rule of Two was violated by Dooku, who took the Dathomirian Nightsister Asajj Ventress on as an assassin and apprentice. However, Sidious, believing Dooku may have been training her to destroy him and sensing that her power had grown, ordered Dooku to eliminate her. Dooku obeyed his master and left her for dead following the Battle of Sullust. Dooku later took the Zabrak Savage Opress, brother of Maul, as his apprentice only for his plan to fail due to Ventress' intervention. Upon receiving a premonition of events to come, the Besalisk Jedi Master Pong Krell fell to the dark side in an attempt to become Dooku's new apprentice, but the clone Dogma executed him after Krell turned on the 501st Legion. Maul later revealed himself to be alive and took Opress as his apprentice, making two rival pairs of Sith. However, Sidious tracked them down and killed Opress during the Mandalorian civil war, whilst allowing Maul to live as he had other uses for him. Dooku took the Jedi Master Quinlan Vos as his apprentice after capturing him, but his plan failed again as Ventress gave her life to save Vos."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Sidious and Vader"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Fall of a Jedi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 BBY, shortly before the end of the Clone Wars, General Grievous kidnapped Palpatine under Sidious' order, in order to bring Anakin Skywalker to the dark side and replace Dooku as his next apprentice. Palpatine's capture led to Kenobi and Skywalker to be dispatched to rescue him aboard the Invisible Hand. During a lightsaber duel aboard the ship, Skywalker defeated and disarmed Dooku. Sidious then betrayed his apprentice by encouraging Anakin to kill the Sith Lord, paving the way for Skywalker to take the older man's place. After Dooku's death, Sidious and his Jedi rescuers eventually made it back to Coruscant. Studentless again, Sidious seduced Skywalker to the dark side by telling him about Plagueis upon discovering his fears that Amidala, his secret wife, would die in childbirth. Skywalker initially revealed Palpatine's secret to Mace Windu, who then attempted to arrest the Chancellor. Skywalker, however, was forced to turn on the Jedi to save Palpatine from being killed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "No longer a Jedi, Skywalker became Sidious' new apprentice and was anointed as Darth Vader. Sidious issued Order 66, causing the clone troopers to turn against their Jedi Generals while Vader purged the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Vader then executed the Separatist Council while Sidious proclaimed himself Galactic Emperor, reorganizing the Republic into the First Galactic Empire. Kenobi and Grand Master Yoda resolved to destroy the Sith, including the former Anakin Skywalker. However, neither Sith Lord was destroyed. Sidious survived his battle with Yoda who subsequently fled into exile. Vader sustained grievous injuries in his duel with Kenobi, and was rebuilt as a cyborg encased within life support armor. Despite learning of Amidala's death, Vader accepted his new role as Sidious' apprentice, renouncing his former identity as Skywalker. Although he struggled with his sentiment for Amidala, following the Battle of Fortress Vader he fully committed himself to the Sith, leading a doubtful Sidious to desist from seeking another apprentice."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Dark side adepts and cyborgs"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Imperial Era, Vader taught the Inquisitorius, a group of former Jedi who had turned to the dark side, and were tasked with hunting down the remaining Jedi, though the Inquisitors themselves only served the Sith and were not considered Sith apprentices, being mere dark side adepts.

The scientist considered Vader a ceremonial apprentice, and therefore believed that his cybernetically enhanced creations were superior to the Sith Lord. Vader regarded Cylo's work as heresy, his creations as abominations; however, the Emperor chastised Vader who was also a cyborg. He reminded Vader that, as an apprentice, it was his duty to learn rather than preach doctrine. By then, Vader had lost favor with his master who blamed him for failing to save the Death Star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader, however, eventually proved himself to his master and killed each of Cylo's creations and Cylo himself. Sidious had reflected on the triumphs of the Sith by then, from their survival as an order to the fall of the Jedi and the rise of the Galactic Empire. He recounted that it took generations before the Sith could return to power through him. He also remembered his former apprentices, Darth Maul and Darth Tyranus, and considered them tools in his ascension to ultimate power.

Skywalker then found Vader and the two engaged in a duel. Vader defeated his son by severing Skywalker's right hand before telling him that he was his father.

He inflicted pain on the kyber, a living entity connected to the Force, in accordance with the traditions of the Sith. As Vader felt the crystals' pain through the Force, Sidious issued an ultimatum to him\u2014to share in his power, but as an apprentice once more. Ultimately, Vader returned to his master's side after experiencing a vision of his son, Luke Skywalker, telling him that he could destroy the Emperor.

Sidious also sought a new apprentice to train; the grandson of Vader and nephew to Luke Skywalker, Ben Solo's strength with the Force was prodigious as a result of his Skywalker bloodline. Through the Force, Sidious secretly communicated with Solo in order to lure him away from the Jedi path, undermining Skywalker's plan to restore the Jedi Order. Rather than directly training Solo, he created Snoke\u2014an artificial strandcast\u2014through whom he could mold the Skywalker heir into a servant of the dark side.
