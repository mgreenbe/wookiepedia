Once inside the volcanoes the customers would then float along the oozing lava or slide down the volcanoes, occasionally launched into the air by bursts of steam. The ride was considered to be very safe, the bubbles well-constructed and transport ships with tractor beams stood by to rescue anyone who managed to get into trouble (i.e., by falling or sinking beneath the flow)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There was also a sport created around LavaRide, putting several riders in bubbles around the caldera and releasing an empty bubble for the riders to knock between goal posts on either end of the field. Many considered the growing sport to be too dangerous, but it did gain popularity- particularly with those interested in organizing betting pools around the game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
