He would later bring his squadron to join Wedge Antilles's side during the Bacta War against Ysanne Isard. He then joined the famed Rogue Squadron after the conflict and participated in the Hunt for Zsinj. At some unknown point, he was captured by agents of Warlord Zsinj and brainwashed to kill Antilles at a given signal. He was activated prior to the Battle of Jussafet Four, where he committed suicide rather than lose his honor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 7 ABY, he commanded a squadron of modified TIE Fighters the Twi'leks nicknamed Chir'daki. Tal'dira and five of his squadron's pilots arrived at the Kala'uun Starport during Rogue Squadron's mission to procure ryll kor, after discovering that Koh'shak, the starport master, had hidden the Rogues' arrival from him in the hopes of profiting from their need for ryll.

Before Corran did so, though, Tal'dira had been affected by comments about his dishonorable attack on Antilles, and reduced all power from his forward shields as Horn flew towards him, effectively committing suicide."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
