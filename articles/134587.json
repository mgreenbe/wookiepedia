One player is the gamemaster, who is in charge of the world\u2014like a director and referee\u2014while the other players each have a single character or role to play. They have various skills and equipment, and some can even use the Force. Additional sourcebooks for this version of the game provide more background information and stats for many aspects of the Star Wars universe, including details about starships, rules for including additional aliens, detailed information on the Jedi order and dark side Force users, and information on regions of the galaxy such as the Core Worlds or Outer Rim."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2002, concurrent with the theatrical release of Episode II, a Revised Core Rulebook was released, which updated a number of rules and statistics for the game. Subsequent books used this updated rules system, while remaining backwards compatible with the previous books. Wizards of the Coast stopped producing new books for the Revised Edition after Ultimate Adversaries in June 2004, focusing instead on the Star Wars Miniatures line. This was due to Wizards' contract with Lucasfilm limiting the number of Star Wars releases Wizards was allowed per year, combined with the miniatures line being more profitable than the roleplaying game."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A new edition of the roleplaying game, known as the Saga Edition, was released on June 5, 2007. At the Celebration IV convention that year, it was possible to get a free copy of the Saga Edition by telling coauthor Rodney Thompson \"Let the Wookiee win\" at the Wizards of the Coast booth. Additional sourcebooks, such as The Force Unleashed Campaign Guide and the updated Starships of the Galaxy, added additional material and rules, including rules for organizations, starship maneuvers, and large-scale cinematic combat. Subsequently, thirteen sourcebooks were produced over the next three years, a significant line of new Star Wars roleplaying products. The sourcebooks have a large amount of background in addition to additional rules and statistics. One of the more notable is the Jedi Academy Training Manual, which has a large section devoted to different Force traditions. Similarly, the Galaxy at War sourcebook has a chapter devoted to military organizations. The Scavenger's Guide to Droids sourcebook is almost entirely background, with far fewer rules."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On January 28th, 2010, Wizards of the Coast announced that they were discontinuing their Star Wars license after The Unknown Regions. The Saga Edition Role Playing Game ended along with the Star Wars Miniatures line with the release of that sourcebook. The license to publish roleplaying material was picked up in 2011 by Fantasy Flight Games, who later published Star Wars: Edge of the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There were free Wizards of the Coast web supplements available for the roleplaying game on Wizards.com, and their roleplaying column Jedi Counseling continued through 2009.
