According to an anonymous interview with a Black Sun member regarding Crusader Armor, a unique business opportunity had presented itself where the Black Sun could create and distribute separate types of battle armor to both the Galactic Empire and the Rebellion. It is assumed that this business deal may have expanded to include certain Crusader weaponry and therefore, this led to its availability from both side's Commendation Officers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Items"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Weaponry available to both Rebels and Imperials"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imperial armor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rebel armor"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
