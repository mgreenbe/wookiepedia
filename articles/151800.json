Their wounds, through concerted attacks, ripped at the god-beast's flesh, but he could not be defeated until this aiwha attacked the mystical being. Sacrificing himself, this aiwha noticed Protas expose his throat, and clamped down on the god-beast's flesh. Protas lost much blood, and though he fought against the aiwha, could not defeat the smaller creature. Though Protas' blows killed the aiwha, still it hung onto his throat, allowing the aiwha pod to deal a final blow to the god-beast."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This aiwha appeared in The Tale of the Aiwha Pod, a short story by Ryan Kaufman, which was published in the 2005 book, Star Wars: Republic Commando: Prima Official Game Guide."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
