The Nu-Cosian race was created through bioengineering, using genetic material from the Cosian species. Some geneticists surmised that the group of related species collectively known as the Delphidians were bioengineered as slaves by some long-gone master. Agricultural scientists Leo Leonis and his wife Tepha worked on creating genetically-modified crops to help feed the people of Chrona. Bioengineering prehensile tails on beings was considered vogue on Coruscant during the Imperial Era. They were said to never last more than a few months. Seasonal chewfly swarms used to plague the Fruited Moon of the Hetzal system until they had been genetically modified out of existence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the death and reincarnation of Darth Sidious, Dark Lord of the Sith, the Sith Eternal cultists turned to gene splicing in their efforts to create a suitable vessel for Sidious' essence. Their experimentation on his template produced various strandcasts, including a cloned \"son\" of the Dark Lord, all of which were deemed failed specimens."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
