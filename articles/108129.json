It was enacted toward the end of Finis Valorum's Chancellery, much to the chagrin of the Trade Federation. In retaliation, the Federation blockaded the planet of Naboo. Unbeknownst to most, the Sith were behind the enactment of the law, as part of a long-running plot by the Dark Lord Darth Sidious to gain absolute power over the galaxy. The Federation's invasion of Naboo led to the planet's Senator, Sheev Palpatine, becoming Supreme Chancellor\u2014but they had done so in part at the behest of Sidious, who was the same person. This allowed Sidious to continue his plans, which culminated in the formation of the Galactic Empire with himself as Emperor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
