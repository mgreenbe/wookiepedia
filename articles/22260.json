The flagship of General Grievous, the leader of the Separatist Droid Army, the cruiser was responsible for the destruction of dozens of Republic task forces, including Jedi Master Plo Koon's fleet in the Abregado system. The Jedi Knight explained that although the Republic Navy's capital ships were vulnerable to the Malevolence's weapons systems, he believed that a squadron of bombers could outmaneuver the ship's ion cannons and destroy the heavy cruiser's bridge, which he hoped would kill Grievous and bring down the ship.
