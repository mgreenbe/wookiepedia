Posing as an officer of the First Order, Solo arranged to buy the archive. At the same time, Organa assigned Poe Dameron with a mission to infiltrate Nu'Tiv's cruiser and take the archive. Solo found the data archive while aboard Nu'Tiv's cruiser, but upon realizing what it was, allowed the Resistance to leave with it. Once Black Squadron returned to D'Qar with the archive, Organa planned to copy its contents and sell the physical archive to collectors who would pay high prices for it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
