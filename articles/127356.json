Their creation was a violation of the Yuuzhan Vong Shaping protocols and caste system, associating them with the heresy secretly encouraged by the Supreme Overlord.

Introduced as \"Shimrra's Jeedai\", they were designed to serve as bodyguards for the Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane and as warriors who could match the Jedi in combat. The Slayers were so named in honor of Yun-Yammka, the Yuuzhan Vong god of war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Supreme Overlord presented the Slayers to the Yuuzhan Vong Elite on Yuuzhan'tar, their appearance caused a scandal. Some denounced their creation as heresy and a violation of the caste system, and Supreme Commander Chaan opined that the Slayers resembled the malformed outcasts known as Shamed Ones\u2014but once a pair of Slayers managed to kill Chaan and his entire cadre of ten warriors, criticism was quickly silenced. As well as a practical means of securing their own position, this display of warrior skill also acted as a deterrent against challenges to Shimrra's authority within the Yuuzhan Vong, either from the Quorealist opposition, the Jeedai heresy, or any who were perturbed by decisions like the creation of the Slayers themselves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Slayers' first operational deployment was on the Outer Rim world of Caluula, where they captured a Galactic Alliance team including the Jedi Kyp Durron and Leia Organa Solo, but most of the Slayers fell sick when the experimental Yuuzhan Vong-targeting pathogen Alpha Red caused them to reject their implants. When Luke Skywalker and Jacen and Jaina Solo faced Shimrra in his throne room, they encountered a second group of Slayers which Shimrra had kept close as bodyguards, and the three Jedi defeated them in a brief but vicious battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One survivor of the Caluula team remained, however\u2014a warrior on whom the effects of Alpha Red had been arrested by the efforts of the Shaper Adept attached to the mission.

However, Zonama Sekot used the Force to fling the ship out into deep space, preventing the attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the end of the war, one Slayer was captured by the Sith faction One Sith and was trained as a Sith apprentice, adopting the name Darth Vua."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Slayers first appeared in James Luceno's 2003 novel The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
