The spacer located five Sayormi voodoo dolls, shadevale eyes, mouf hair, and a Mysess blossom for Athnalu.

Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, Athnalu came under the belief that the Sayormi people\u2014a mysterious species that lived in the Dead Forest of the Kkowir Forest\u2014had placed a spell on her. She thought herself possessed and cursed by the Sayormi. Believing that her very soul was rotting away, Athnalu lived in constant pain and fear, which caused her to grow increasingly mentally unstable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That same year, Athnalu was approached by a spacer who was visiting her village. Athnalu explained her situation and the curse she believed she was under and pleaded for the spacer to help her. The spacer accepted the Wookiee's request for assistance, and Athnalu tasked the traveler with collecting five voodoo dolls that she thought the Sayormi were using to possess her. By having the dolls, Athnalu hoped they would help her understand why the Sayormi had placed the curse on her. After the spacer had completed the task and returned to Athnalu, the Wookiee rewarded the being with 1,000 credits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, unsatisfied with the results from the dolls, Athnalu again asked the spacer for assistance. The spacer agreed, and Athnalu told the traveler to find three more items that she thought were needed to cure her: the eyes of a shadevale, snakes that lived in the nearby lakes and streams; hairs from a mouf, large, woolly creatures that wandered the forest; and finally a Mysess blossom, a flower that grew in the village. The spacer dutifully collected all she requested and brought them to Athnalu, which the Wookiee mixed together into a potion and consumed. Now satisfied that she was free of the curse's influence, she thanked the spacer and rewarded the being with another 1,200 credits and a special ceremonial chair from the village."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While thinking herself under the power of a Sayormi curse, Athnalu became crazed and unbalanced, believing her very soul was dying.
