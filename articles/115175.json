As the playable character of the game, Revan's physical characteristics and gender were customizable by the player for gameplay purposes; Revan's male gender was then confirmed in The New Essential Chronology. In Legends, Revan was a Jedi Knight who broke away from the Jedi Order and formed a Sith Empire that waged war against the Order and the Galactic Republic.

Revan would have appeared as a Sith Lord alongside Darth Bane as advisors to the powerful Force wielder known as the Son, but they were ultimately cut from the episode in late production. The show's director, Dave Filoni, was apprehensive of using the scene, and the scene was removed at George Lucas's request because it conflicted with Lucas's view on the Force. Filoni stated the removal of the scene was because Sith Lords existing beyond death or outside of the Force contradicted the established aspects and meaning of it, though the idea was acknowledged and it went far into development. Filoni also thought it was cool for Revan to potentially appear in the TV series, along with Bane in some sort of capacity. The scene made it to the animatics stage and can be viewed in the bonus content on the Blu-ray edition of Star Wars: The Clone Wars The Complete Season Three. In this cut scene, Revan was modelled after his Legends appearance."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The scene"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The cut scene of Revan is set in the Well of the Dark Side on the planet Mortis, where the Son confronts dark side spirits about the recent death of his sister, the Daughter, at his hands.

Speaking of another's existence who will control the galaxy, Revan and Bane warn the Son that control over Anakin Skywalker, the Chosen One, is the key to the Son's success."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
