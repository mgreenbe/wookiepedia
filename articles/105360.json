Its name came from an off-hand description of the Metatheran Cartel that was made by a reporter. The band was made up of Tarasin from the Buraka irstat, including Nyronusa. They hated the Cartel, as they held it responsible for the destruction of a Ch'hala tree grove that they had been tasked with protecting. During the Clone Wars, they performed at a party held by the Cartel on Dorumaa, where they hoped to gain revenge. They wore Caarite masks while they performed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The band played Tarasin-style music, which was popular with their own species, but not with many others."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
