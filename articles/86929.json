It was issued around ten months after the Battle of Geonosis. It featured more enhancements, and was resistant against Blaster fire up to light cannon rounds. Black-clad camouflage first became available upon the release of the Mark III armor. Mark III armor was EMP hardened and resistant to Verpine rounds, just like the Mark II version. Its incredible resistance to damage was exemplified during a noted operation where commando Fi Skirata threw himself onto a explosive, managing to survive only being badly shaken, earning him the admiration of the Coruscanti police."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
