Arriving at the planet, they rescue the last two surviving members of the team, who claim to have been attacked by hostiles. An investigation turns up no hostiles, just the dead bodies of the science team. The crew then begin to feel paranoid and hostile towards each other, and the effect is traced back to an artifact, the Plaque of Victory, that the science team found while excavating ruins. The Plaque is overcome by sending it into deep space through an airlock."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
