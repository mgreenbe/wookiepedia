He took over the minor Dust Vipers gang operating on Tatooine and quickly made it into a force to be reckoned with for the entire Tatoo system. The gang established a base near Anchorhead and possessed enough starfighters to conduct pirate raids on trade route vessels along the Outer Rim. Following the death of Empress Vaylin and formation of the Eternal Alliance in 3631 BBY, the Dust Vipers ambushed an Alliance supply convoy and obtained security plans for the Alliance base on Odessen. This prompted the Alliance to retaliate against the Dust Vipers: a task force was send into their compound, where they defeated Jai Quallo, Crack-Shot Aggy and even their prisoner Rakesh the Foul. Eventually Bel Nerodia himself confronted the group with the droid G9-RX, but was defeated and killed, leaving the remaining Dust Vipers leaderless."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bel Nerodia appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne as the final boss fight of \"Done and Dusted\" Uprising."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
