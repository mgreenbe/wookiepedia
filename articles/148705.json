Trask was a black market port, and its population consisted mostly of Mon Calamari and Quarren. It featured a series of landing platforms and an inn where chowder was served. There was a rule for departing ships against ascending into the upper atmosphere inside the harbor zone."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin took a job to transport a passenger and her spawn to her husband, who had settled on Trask as it was the only world hospitable to their species. As they came into the atmosphere, Djarin had to manually land the Razor Crest with no guidance and crashed into the shallow sea. He paid a Mon Calamari a thousand credits to fix his ship as he entered the port town. Djarin reunited \"Frog Lady\" with her husband before entering the local inn. He paid a Mon Calamari server in Calamari Flan for information on where he could find other Mandalorians. He was directed to a Quarren, who offered him passage to meet a group of his people."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Quarren fishermen took Djarin on a fishing vessel to reunite him with other Mandalorians, however, this was a ruse to kill Djarin and steal his beskar armor.

The trio were on Trask to seize weapons from an Imperial Gozanti freighter to use to retake their home world of Mandalore. Djarin agreed to help Bo-Katan with her mission in exchange for information on the Jedi.
