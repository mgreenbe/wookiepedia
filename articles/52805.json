A renowned smuggler in the Borderland Regions, Tembon was never captured by any authorities, although several operatives of his were. The Sullustan had a reputation for never refusing a customer or cargo, including the transportation of slaves. Tembon was popular with several organizations, including the Riders of the Maelstrom, the Galactic Empire, and criminal organizations including Hutt kajidics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The operatives captured by the New Republic indicated that Tembon had a change of heart, and was willing to cut of all ties to the Empire and to no longer transport slave cargo. The change in attitude was reportedly due to the Empire's attempts to forcibly acquire some of his starships, a move that infuriated Tembon. While the New Republic considered the information suspect, the information from Tembon's operatives indicated that he was operating out of the Nexer system. The New Republic posted a reward for Tembon's capture; 30,000 credits on the charges of smuggling, transportation of slaves, conspiracy to deprive sapients of their freedom, and manslaughter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gaor Tembon was a Sullustan male who stood 1.7 meters tall.
