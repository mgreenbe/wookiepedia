It was the third such series, after The Official Star Wars Fact File and The Official Figurine Collection. The magazine featured detailed information on a featured starship or other vehicle, characters that pilot it, diagrams and charts, and much more information about the Star Wars universe as a whole. There was also a metal die-cast model of the ship that came in a plastic display case, with background information relevant to the specific vehicle. Like the Fact Files, it was a licensed source of Legends information under the LucasBooks imprint."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Issues"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
