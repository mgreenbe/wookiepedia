Created on the Wild Space planet Kamino at some point during or after 32 BBY as a male clone of the Human bounty hunter Jango Fett. Two-Eight was trained by Cuy'val Dar sergeant Kal Skirata to serve in the Galactic Republic's  Grand Army. At some point before the outbreak of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY he was decapitated during a training exercise on Kamino as a result of of his own mishandling of explosives during a rapid entry procedure. Although he was instantly replaced with another commando, the loss of Two-Eight would haunt the squad's sergeant, RC-1309, some time after his death. As a clone of Jango Fett, Two-Eight stood 1.83 meters tall."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Two-Eight was first mentioned in Republic Commando: Hard Contact, a 2004 novel written by Karen Traviss. In a 2005 discussion forum on StarWars.com, Traviss stated that RC-1309's original squad, which included Two-Eight, was named \"Lambda Squad\" in her notes for Hard Contact, but the name did not appear in the novel. The trooper's numerical designation and background correlates with RC-8028, a fellow clone commando who also died in training on Kamino, but no source explicitly states that the two commandos are the same."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
