Nak'har, the Human Thook Lafrell and some of Gomalo's other thugs stole the sculpture and various other pieces of artwork from a display in the city Tolea Biqua on the planet Genarius, and they took the works of art to a room in the Starlight Lounge, a hotel that Gomalo was using as his base of operations. The undercover Cularin Office of Public Safety agent Ezra Du'Re was dispatched to recover the missing items, and Nak'har and Lafrell captured her and escorted her to their hotel room, to use her as insurance while they completed their job for Gomalo. However, a group of freelance agents investigated Du'Re's disappearance and tracked her to the Starlight Lounge, where they confronted Nak'har and Gomalo's other thugs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
