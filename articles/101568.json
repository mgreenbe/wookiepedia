On Kashyyyk, Orrekazzapirr and his friends tried to investigate the Trandoshans' slaving operations in one of their camps near Kachirho, but were ambushed and overpowered. Orrekazzapirr and Imarra were captured and brought to the slaver camp. Soon after, the Trandoshans sold them to the Empire who shipped them to their prison facility on Dathomir. The Empire didn't want anyone to know about their involvement in the Trandoshans' slaving operations on Kashyyyk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Orrekazzapirr and Imarra were lucky, as queen Kylantha grew worried when she didn't receive any news from them and asked an experienced adventurer to investigate. The adventurer found the wounded Drrlirm in the jungles and eventually found out about their imprisonment on Dathomir. After the pilot had managed to sneak through the Imperial blockade around the planet and landed on the planet, the spacer managed to infiltrate the prison facility and help Orrekazzapirr and Imarra escape. Imarra knew the location of an old Alliance hideout on the planet where an old ship was stored. The two Wookiees managed to make their way to the hangar and used the old ARC-170 starfighter to leave the planet. With Imarra at the controls and Orrekazzapirr on the gunner's seat, the two met up with the spacer's starship. Together they managed to punch a hole in the Imperial blockade and escape to Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Orrekazzapirr was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts.
