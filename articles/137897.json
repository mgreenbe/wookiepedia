Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala possessed several dresses bearing this symbol, including the black traveling gown worn by her handmaiden Sab\u00e9 while disguised as the queen and the jubilation dress Amidala wore during the Naboo victory parade. She continued to incorporate the symbol into her wardrobe after she became a senator. Other queens who wore the crest included Neeyutnee, who wore it on her forehead, and Apailana, who wore it on the trim of her mourning dress at Amidala's funeral. The symbol was also used to honor the dead after the Battle of Naboo; it was carved into the headstone of every Naboo who perished during the fighting."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
