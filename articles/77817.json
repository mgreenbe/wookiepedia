They were massive creatures, with fangs as big as a fully grown Ewok. They had long necks with large heads that could breathe fire through their nostrils. The Kradak had four thick legs and long tails lined with vertical bony plates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thousands of years before 3 ABY, the Kradaks were believed to have gone extinct. However, one Kradak went into deep hibernation, burying itself in a deep cavern. The Ewoks of Bright Tree Village eventually built their home above this hibernating Kradak. During a minor conflict with the Duloks, the village was nearly flooded due to the sabotage of the Ewoks' dam. The onrush of water began to drip into the hidden cavern of the remaining Kradak, causing it to wake after thousands of years. Using its massive size and ability to breathe fire, the Kradak set about attempting to destroy the trees of the village. However, before the Kradak could reach the village's support tree and bring down the entire habitat, the Ewok Princess Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka made a shrinkroot potion and used it to shrink the beast, saving her tribe. The shrunken Kradak was placed into a tiny wooden cage where it no longer posed any threat to the Ewoks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
