When Gillmunn brought a Rebel diplomatic envoy to the planet to meet with the resistance, Hesz was furious. When Hesz found out that a member of the team, one Luke Skywalker was wanted by Darth Vader himself, he promised to exchange the rebel for an end to hostilities on Jabiim. When his plan backfired he was only able to provide Lord Vader with rebel mathematician Jorin Sol. This, along with Skywalker and the others' escape, angered Vader, who ordered the populace of the planet enslaved and an orbital bombardment, reducing the planet to rubble."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This event devastated Hesz, who undertook a personal mission to find Sol and his people.
