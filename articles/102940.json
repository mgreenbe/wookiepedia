With the help of Rylee Dray and Destris Veran, they managed to infiltrate Paladius's rally. Paladius ordered his cultists to attack Kallig, but they were defeated. Afterwards, Paladius contacted Kallig and said he would give Kallig the artifact without any further confrontation. Kallig, along with Dray and Veran, visited Paladius's main base. When they arrived, Paladius calmly offered Kallig a drink, but it was quickly revealed that it was all a trap. Paladius had severed Kallig's connection to the Force and attacked the young Sith. However, Paladius was overwhelmed and defeated by Kallig. Paladius immediately offered his complete loyalty to Kallig. Veran and Dray protested, but Kallig betrayed them and killed Veran by throwing him off the main platform of the base. Paladius then assured Dray that she would survive, but be punished. Dray attempted to flee, but Paladius killed her with Force lightning. Kallig then left Paladius in charge of the cult in their name."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Moff Pyron contacted the now Lord Kallig, Pyron agreed to side with him against Darth Thanaton if Kallig could deliver him the CN-12 sensor chip. He told Kallig that his cult on Nar Shaddaa would be able to assist. Kallig met with his cult on Nar Shaddaa, where Paladius welcomed them and assured them they were the future of the Sith. When Kallig asked if he had any CN-12 chips, Paladius answered that the Veil had bothered them and made them temporarily unavailable. Kallig then traveled to the Veil's safehouse, where three men all claimed to be \"the Veil\". They wanted Kallig to hand the cult over to them and Kallig would gain many members of the Veil as his servants across the galaxy. Kallig was not fooled, however and killed them all. Kallig returned to Paladius, who greeted him and thanked him. Kallig then told Pyron of his success."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Paladius was among those who swore their loyalty to Darth Nox when they ascended to the Dark Council."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and Abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Paladius was capable of using Force lightning and Force push.
