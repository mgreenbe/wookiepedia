Augmented with superior armor, weapons and computer interface systems, 13-K became the center of Krell's plot to wipe out the Rebel fleet. 13-K commandeered a Rebel blockade runner and intended to detonate the ship at the Rebel rendezvous point. However, the meddling of Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker, and a failure of 13-K's logic capacitators, led 13-K to instead destroy Krell's Star Destroyer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Created in the wake of the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY, the probe droid designated 13-K was created as one of the first Infiltrator probe droids, created as part of a joint venture between Arakyd Industries and Imperial technicians under the supervision of Admiral Damon Krell. As part of the Infiltrator program, 13-K was upgraded with additional armor and weapons, plus the ability to plug in and completely control electronic systems. Desiring recognition from the Emperor, Krell saw the Infiltrators as his chance to wipe out the Rebel fleet in one fell swoop. Krell dispatched 13-K on a solo mission to capture a Rebel blockade runner, which it did without issue, blasting through the ship's hull and killing everyone aboard before an alarm could be raised."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That was the first stage of Krell's plan for glory\u2014the next step was for 13-K to plug into the blockade runner's systems, commandeer the ship, return to the Rebel rendezvous point and self-destruct, causing catastrophic damage. However, a chance encounter during the ensuing transit led to the plan's unraveling, when 13-K happened across and destroyed an X-wing piloted by Rebel hero Luke Skywalker. Skywalker and his astromech droid R2-D2 managed to make their way aboard 13-K's ship and determine what was happening, also learning that 13-K's link into the ship's reactor ensured that attempts to damage or dislodge the droid would result in their deaths."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Skywalker was in a seemingly impossible situation, the young Human was suddenly struck with an idea. Skywalker started causing damage aboard the blockade runner, prompting 13-K to respond by overloading a wall circuit and causing an explosion that knocked Skywalker unconscious. Upon awakening, Skywalker used the Force to keep his vital signs at coma level, masking his presence from 13-K as he sabotaged key systems within the ship. In the meantime, Skywalker's presence triggered prior programming directly from the Sith Lord Darth Vader, which ordered it to take Skywalker alive and return him personally to the Emperor. 13-K deviated from its previous trajectory towards the Rebel fleet and instead turned back, ignoring Krell's commands to proceed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "13-K intended to return to turn Skywalker over to Krell, but all the while, Skywalker's sabotage was turning the blockade runner into a ticking time bomb. Skywalker weakened the ship's systems enough that him and R2-D2 were able to launch an escape pod, and with the blockade runner's reactor still wired to explode, 13-K suffered a catastrophic failure in its logic capacitators that prevented it from acknowledging Krell's directives. 13-K's ship ultimately exploded and ripped through Krell's Star Destroyer, bringing an end to droid and creator both."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Based off the shape of the more well-known Viper probe droid, 13-K had several significant upgrades over its commonplace counterpart, including thick armor plating, augmented weapons and the ability to directly control electronic systems. It was much larger than a regular Viper probe droid, and its firepower was such that it could blast a hole clean through the hull of a corvette. 13-K also had the ability to operate and make decisions much more independently than a typical probe droid, but its augmented systems struggled to integrate with its regular programming, causing a crucial failure of its logic capacitators during its final mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "13-K first appeared in Star Wars 45, an issue of the original Marvel Star Wars comic series, written by Archie Goodwin and released on December 2, 1980. In the issue, the droid was illustrated by Carmine Infantino."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
