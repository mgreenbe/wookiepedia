The Confederacy of Independent Systems won a victory over the Galactic Republic in the battle. The Republic's defeat at Carida, coupled with similar defeats elsewhere, led Jedi Grand Master Yoda to believe that the Republic needed another victory in the war. However, later during the war, Carida was once again controlled by the Republic. Around 20 BBY, the Republic held a strategy conference aboard the Valor space station orbiting Carida."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle was briefly mentioned in The Clone Wars: Wild Space, a novel written by Karen Miller and published in 2008."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
