It was also the day Ezra Bridger was born, and two days before the births of Luke and Leia Skywalker on Polis Massa. From the following year on, Empire Day became a holiday marking the anniversary of the rise of the Empire. Festivities of the holiday included a parade on various Imperial-controlled planets, the playing of the Imperial anthem, \"Glory of the Empire\", as well as the airing of Palpatine with two Royal Guards at the Imperial Senate, but the footage used made the Emperor seem younger and more physically appealing than he actually was at the time of the speech. Attendance to the festivities was mandatory. On Coruscant, the holiday was the cap to a week of festivities known as Ascension Week."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The term Empire Day was derived from a holiday within the United Kingdom and extended throughout the countries of the Commonwealth, celebrating the anniversary of the British Empire's formation between 1902 and 1958.
