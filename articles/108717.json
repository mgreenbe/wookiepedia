The main engines were mounted in the superstructure rising above the hull platform at the rear, which was topped by a row of sensor globes. The primary armament consisted of two weapons turrets mounted ahead of the superstructure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The light cruiser had a docking bay capable of launching several TIE Series starfighters, and it was sometimes equipped with more potent TIE Advanced x1 starfighters.
