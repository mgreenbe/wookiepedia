Near the city of Kergara, the Drinking Cup was noted for the seawater that flooded its bottom, which allowed for the formation of whirlpools during tidal shifts.

Whistler's Whirlpool had a brief period of popularity before eventually shutting its doors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
