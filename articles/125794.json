Around 15 BBY, she acquired the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO when they were dumped at her refueling station. The Bimm later taught R2-D2 to play dejarik holo-chess. However, the droids departed when Sindee's gambling addiction led her to lose them in a game of Liar's Cut to the smuggler Zevel Hortine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The refueling station was first mentioned in the 2002 reference book The New Essential Guide to Characters, written by Daniel Wallace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
