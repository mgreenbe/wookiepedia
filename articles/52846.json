It was the capital city  and main trading hub on Dantooine during the Jedi Civil War. The city evidently did not host a large population, as Dantooine was considered to have no urban center. Garang had some form of municipal authorities, along with a database that archived business transactions and criminal records. It also boasted a spaceport to handle the planet's exportation of foodstuffs and other products. The city, along with Dantooine itself, was aligned with the Galactic Republic and worked closely with the Jedi Order, who had an enclave on the planet. In 3956 BBY, it played host to at least one sub-orbital transport corporation and was, according to rumor, the base of operations of a local unnamed Hutt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
