The unit was named after its supervisor Zaluna Myder, a thirty year veteran of the Transcept. Operators corresponded with several surveillance supercomputers that were linked to all surveillance cameras operating in public spaces and facilities on the planet Gorse and its moon Cynda. The floor that the Mynocks operated in was equipped with full-spectrum lightning to compensate for the lack of sunlight on Gorse's nightward side. The Mynocks operated from World Window Plaza, an upside-down truncated cone that was regarded to be the newest building on Gorse."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Myder's Mynocks was founded during the last years of the Galactic Republic to monitor electronic communications and certain monitored public places for \"conversations suspected to pose a threat to the lives of Republic citizens.\" During the Clone Wars, the Mynocks' mandate was changed to identifying threats to \"Republic security.\" By the time of the Galactic Empire, the organization was tasked with monitoring all threats to \"public order.\" Their functions included hunting for fugitive Jedi who had survived Order 66 and reporting verbal threats made by citizens against the Empire.

As a result, Imperial forces were dispatched to arrest Skelly. Later, Hetto was arrested for accessing incriminating information about the Empire and making contact with the rebel operative Hera Syndulla. This information concerned the Imperial industrialist Count Denetrius Vidian and was of interest to Hera, who was part of an emerging rebel network that was dedicated to opposing the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The following day, the entire division was suspended. The Mynocks' supervisor Zaluna was also suspended after she did not turn up for work. Due to her suspension and entanglement with the rebels Hera Syndulla, Skelly, Kanan Jarrus, Zaluna decided not to return to Transcept and instead played a role in stopping Vidian's plot to destroy Cynda during the Gorse conflict. Later, Zaluna settled on a remote agricultural world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
