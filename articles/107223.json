Power crystals were used to bore a hole in deflector shields. They fire a red beam of energy that split into a spiral of red lines upon impact with the shields; the red lines then began to corkscrew, opening up a hole in the shield. Power crystals required a large amount of energy to operate. The salvagers Khedryn Faal and Marr Idi-Shael kept one on their freighter, the Junker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
