It can mean the collection, the building or room that housed such a collection, or both. The term \"library\" has itself acquired a secondary meaning: \"a collection of useful material for common use.\" Public and institutional collections and services may be intended for use by people who choose not to \u2014 or can't afford to \u2014 purchase an extensive collection themselves, who need material no individual can reasonably be expected to have, or who require professional assistance with their research. In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are experts at finding and organizing information and at interpreting information needs. Many libraries were also repositories and access points for maps, prints, or other documents and various storage media."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Libraries were defined as places to get unrestricted access to information in many formats and from many sources.
