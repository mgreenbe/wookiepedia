The Father placed it with the Daughter's body in her tomb, but the dagger was stolen by the Son shortly thereafter. Rather than have the Son murder him with it, the Father took it from him and stabbed himself with the blade, mortally injuring himself and severing the Son's powers, allowing him to be killed by Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the death of Abeloth, the former Mother, in 44 ABY, Grand Master Luke Skywalker sent ten Jedi Knights out to search for the Mortis monolith so that they could recover the Dagger. The Jedi wanted the Dagger as insurance against the return of Abeloth. The Son and the Daughter were the ones who had defeated Abeloth every time she had escaped before, and since the Dagger could kill the Ones, Luke believed it could also kill Abeloth\u2014who had drunk from the Font of Power like the Son and bathed in the Pool of Knowledge like the Daughter. It is unknown whether the Dagger was created on Mortis, or the Ones' original home planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
