He once theorized that his species was possibly a naturally Force-sensitive one."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like their Sullustan cousins from Sullust, the Jashwik were a humanoid species, with two arms, two legs, and a head. Their face had a mouth and a nose, two eyes, all arranged in the same approximate positions as on a Human's head. They had peach-colored skin and their thick-lipped mouths were filled with white, blunt teeth. Their eyes were globulous and egg-shaped, with a yellowish sclera and a small black pupil. Their arms ended in hands with four long, claw-like fingers, including an opposable thumb to aid grasping. Contrary to the Sullustans, who sported wide, round earlobes, the Jashwik had tapered ears. Males of the species also had the ability to grow hair, both on the top of the head and on the cheeks and chin. The Jashwik also had knees that bent forward, thus allowing them to sit on their buttocks with their back upright. During emotional stress, a Jashwik would go though a perspiration process to maintain normal body temperature. It was speculated that the whole species was naturally keenly attuned to the Force, a mystic energy that flowed through all living things and bound the galaxy together, but only in a latent way."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some male Jashwik favored shoulder-length hairstyles and dressed in bright colors\u2014including yellow, red and blue.

Cody Sunn-Childe, who was introduced and killed off in the very same issue, is the only known representative of this species in canon. In Star Wars 46, Sunn-Childe only referred to the Jashwik as \"my own race.\" The proper species name was not revealed until 2013, when Abel G. Pe\u00f1a wrote Viva Space Vegas! The History of the Marvelous Wheel for the official StarWars.com blog. In the same article, Pe\u00f1a also established the genetic relationship between the Jashwik and the Sullustans, a jowled species first introduced in the 1983 movie Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
