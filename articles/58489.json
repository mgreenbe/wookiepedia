It was thought of as both a work and a functional weapon, and featured clean lines and bronzium plating, with a streamlined, tubiform aesthetic. The Equalizer teetered on the edge of a heavy blaster pistol classification, as a result of its accuracy, energy output, and space for aftermarket kits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They were released by Coronet Arms in limited numbers due to the Equalizer's extensive handcrafting that went into every blaster pistol, which made it a major status symbol among what few CorSec officers and successful free traders wielded them. Outside the Corellian sector, the H-7 was exceptionally rare, being found in the collections of the most dedicated and knowledgeable gun enthusiasts.
