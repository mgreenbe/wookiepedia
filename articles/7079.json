The various circles on Kegan formed an interconnected ring around the Gathering Circle. V-Davi hoped to work in the Animal Circle upon graduation from the Learning Circle, but until O-Vieve and V-Tan were ousted as Benevolent Guides, providing more choice for workers, chances of that were slim as there was a surplus of workers for the Circle during 44 BBY. Via worked in the Animal Circle following their Benevolent Guides' removal from power, and she helped teach V-Davi how to care for animals within the Circle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
