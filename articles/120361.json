Little did Pirrell know, however, was that his bounty hunter was secretly in the Great Hunt and their target was Ivernus himself. As Ivernus came out of his ship, the hunter attacked and killed him, as well as Pirell's Cathar servant, Murghir, who was revealed to be the other hunter attempting to kill Ivernus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
