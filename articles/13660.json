Despite this, the Starfleet was able to hold its own at first, until the Yuuzhan Vong pulled back. What the Remnant expected to be a retreat was soon revealed to be the launch of a swarm of thousands of grutchins."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fleet responded to the grutchins with appalling disorganization; only Pellaeon's own Star Destroyer, the Chimaera, responded with appropriate efficiency and effectiveness on short notice.

After assessing the situation, they jumped toward the gas giant where a force composed of the Chimaera, the Imperial Star Destroyer Superior, and their support craft were pinned against planet's gravity mass shadow by a powerful enemy contingent. The Jedi provided Pellaeon with information on the location of the enemy's yammosk before departing for Yaga Minor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pellaeon dispatched TIE Fighters to deal with the yammosk carrier and then attempted to break out of the gas giant's mass shadow. The Superior was critically damaged and Pellaeon ordered its evacuation as it fell into the depths of the planet. The Chimaera had also taken considerable damage by the time a coralskipper rammed its bridge. The suicide run nearly killed Pellaeon, but a junior officer pulled the Grand Admiral from the bridge and loaded him aboard a medical frigate carrying survivors from Superior. Under the cover of wreckage from the dying Star Destroyer, and the brave sacrifices made by a dozen of the Superior's TIE Fighter pilots, the frigate was able to escape for Yaga Minor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Toward the end of the battle, a Yuuzhan Vong slaveship arrived over Bastion and began to harvest Imperial citizens who had been unable to escape in time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While caught off guard, the efforts of the Imperial Navy enabled most of Bastion's population to escape in time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon arrival in the Yaga system, the shuttle's pilot, a Human male named Vitor Reige, ferried Pellaeon to the Imperial frigate Widowmaker.
