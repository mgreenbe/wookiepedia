The caverns were inhabited at some point prior to Durace's devastation and they contained a number of primitive carvings. The carvings were later studied by scholars and while the pictographs revealed little about the nature of the calamity that beset the world, the academics remained hopeful that they would find more such carvings elsewhere."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
