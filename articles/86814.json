The Marillion and four other cruisers of its type were part of the Republic force commanded by Admiral Pevel Kronara at the Battle of Kur against the Nihil marauders of Kassav Milliko's Tempest. Two of the Pacifier-class cruisers present in the Kur Nebula, the Marillion and the Yekkabird of Corellia, were destroyed by the Nihil.
