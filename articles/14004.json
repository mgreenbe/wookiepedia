By 3964 BBY, the Mandalorian Neo-Crusader armies, led by chieftain Mandalore the Ultimate, had begun probing the Republic's borders. Preparing for a larger invasion aimed at the ecumenopolis of Taris, the Mandalorians soon set their sights on Flashpoint Stellar Research Station, a Republic scientific installation within striking distance of Taris and its tributary worlds. Located on the barren world of Flashpoint extremely close to its star, Flashpoint Station was situated under an artificial magnetic shield that protected it from the extreme heat and radiation generated from the nearby star."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A scientific research station, Flashpoint Station was only lightly defended and was an easy target for a Mandalorian attack.
