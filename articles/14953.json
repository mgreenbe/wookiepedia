The X-wings then jumped in and destroyed the static defenses. While the B-wings made torpedo runs at the main Sensor Array destroying it. The platform meanwhile had sent TIE/LN starfighters and TIE/IN interceptors to try to stop the Rebels. It also sent TIE/sa bombers to try to take out the Assault Transports knowing that once they were down they could call in reinforcements. This was unsuccessful as the Rebel Starfighters managed to stop the TIE Bombers and the stations shields were failing. The Imperial Officers then attempted to escape in the Lambda-class T-4a shuttle Jev.
