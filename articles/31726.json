Although serene looking and graceful, the crown of silk was a vicious predator. It would encircle the head of its prey and compress it to paralyze the creature and feed on its ambient energies for one to a few hours, and would leave the victim dazed for a few days after the attack. Though many things could damage a crown of silk, only heat or fire would cause it to release its prey before it had finished feeding. Simply pulling off the crown could leave its victim with permanent neurological damage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The crown of silk was attracted to Force-sensitive people.
