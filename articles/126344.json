Izax, the Ultimate Devourer, was the chief deity of the pantheon, while the other members were his wife, Scyva, and their four children: Tyth, Aivela, Esne, and Nahut. The demon serpent Zildrog was another entity worshiped by the Old Ways, though Zildrog was often considered simply an aspect of Izax. Valkorion claimed to be the Demon Savior of prophecy, one who would topple the Old Gods and usher in a new era of prosperity, and worship of the Old Gods was mostly abandoned by his Eternal Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Old Gods were originally created by Iokath's original architects as titanic droid superweapons to be used on unready civilizations to pacify, subjugate, and destroy them, which lead to the deaths of trillions aeons ago. Among the victims affected by these superweapons was Zakuul, which lead the superweapons to be mythologized as ruthless deities. The superweapons slumbered after the disaster that wiped out the Iokath species, but The Old Gods were eventually awakened. This occurred during the Machine Gods crisis on Iokath in 3629 BBY. The Heralds of Zildrog still followed the old ways but were considered more of a cult."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
