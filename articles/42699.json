When Quelsh asked an independent agent to help in the investigation of the theft, Yamagh pointed the spacer to a group of local thugs known as Braggan's Fist. The agent managed to successfully solve the case of the stolen medal and found proof that Quelsh had framed former CorSec officer Kal Braggan for a crime that Quelsh had committed and that he had later murdered Braggan. Yamagh was left speechless by Quelsh's crimes, as he had always considered it an honor to work for a highly decorated officer like Quelsh."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Edbr Yamagh was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
