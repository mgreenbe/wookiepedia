Out of twelve subjects, only six of them survived the incubation period. They underwent flash instructions and live exercises, where they obtained unmeasurable high scores.

She would provide information regarding Separatist spies, and in return, all clone troopers and settlers on Qiilura would be relocated within a year. Wennen, on the other hand, revealed herself as an undercover Republic Treasury agent and sympathetic to the plight of the clone troopers. Kal assured her that what they were doing was for the benefit of all clones. Wennen surprised everyone by voluntarily giving them her datapad, which contained Treasury data, codes, and encryption algorithms. This action made Ordo consider her as a potential ally, so she was allowed to live.

It involved chanting the lyrics while simultaneously beating the rhythm into one's armor, then striking the armor of the person beside him. All of the clones present joined in, including Ordo and Captain Maze. Through the dance, Ordo was distracted by the absence of Wennen, whom he had invited, and was hit several times in the face by Maze because of it. The repeated strikes drew blood, but Ordo let the matter drop, considering it as his payback for when he struck Maze in the nose days before.

On their first flight aboard the Aay'han, they were contacted by Delta's sergeant, Boss, about Vau's mishap on Mygeeto, and learned that Vau had fallen into a crevasse after robbing the Dressian Kiolsh Merchant Bank. Despite their deep dislike for Vau, they risked their lives by going to the blockaded planet and fast-talking their way in.

He wiped the droid's memory of the event and took Tur-Mukan to Dorumaa to help with the search for Ko Sai. When he arrived, the group had already captured her. Ordo was faced with Sai once more since his early days on Kamino. Prior to this encounter, Ordo had already been angry, and radiated more fear in the Force than Tur-Mukan could remember. His troubled frame of mind was exacerbated when he heard the news of Fi's injury in the Battle of Gaftikar. Even with Tur-Mukan's help in the interrogation, Sai refused to divulge information on how to stop the clones' accelerating age growth. Ordo finally snapped, and shot the datachips containing all of Sai's research with his hold-out blaster. When asked by a devastated Kal on why he did so after all of their hard work, he reasoned that she once held the power of life over them and was doing so again by withholding information.

The Cuy'val Dar was the title given to the one hundred training sergeants, of which seventy-five were Mandalorians, Jango Fett recruited to train the clone commandos. Ordo and Kal soon left Kyrimorut after Wennen started an armed siege on the Republic Central Medcenter. Fi was being treated at the medcenter after suffering a serious head trauma during a mission, and a medical droid had pronounced him brain-dead and attempted to euthanize him. Wennen refused to allow this act to happen and threatened the medical droid with a blaster, guarding Fi until help arrived in the form of Obrim and his men from the CSF. Tur-Mukan and Mereel continued to interrogate the devastated Sai; what the Kaminoan scientist did not know was that her research still existed. Ordo had destroyed a different set of datachips and hid the real ones in order to break Sai's resolve. Knowing that Kal's genuine reaction to the research's loss would convince Sai of the reality of the situation, Ordo decided not to tell his adopted father of his plan. On their way to Jaller Obrim's residence where Fi was relocated after his extraction from the medcenter, Ordo received the message from Mereel, stating that Sai was beginning to cooperate.

Aboard the speeder, Ordo interrogated the agent, whose name he learned was Arbian J. Lemmeloth; a very highly placed intelligence agent who was two promotions shy from reporting directly to the Chancellor. He made sure Wennen would not be implicated by accessing Lemmeloth's secure comm system and sending a message stating Wennen made no contacts and went straight home.

The reunion was later moved to the ship's wardroom upon Kal's suggestion. They celebrated their reunion over nerf steaks and Chandrilan wine, over which Kal formally adopted the rest of the Nulls; an act that quelled the guilt inside Ordo, as he didn't want to be seen as the favorite and wanted to be on equal terms with his brothers. Their celebration was noticed by Ensign Luszgoti, an unpopular officer who was also part of COMPOR. Luszgoti insulted Ordo by calling him a \"clone\" instead of his rank, and also referred to Kal as hired help. Luszgoti further protested Kal and A'den's presence in an officers-only area. Ordo tried to be civil by pointing out his rank to Luszgoti, and cited a subsection in the regulations, stating that an officer could bring guests to the wardroom. Luszgoti refused to apologize, and threatened to have Ordo court martialed, which earned him a head-butt and a broken nose. Ordo forced him to apologize to Kal, and charged him for insubordination.

Ordo volunteered for the operation, along with Vau and Tay'haai. They first sent an immediate prisoner transfer request to the RDS headquarters using a bogus authority code from Republic Intelligence. The ploy worked, and Zentis was scheduled to be transferred.

As an ARC Captain, Ordo began ordering units to defend strategic locations, sending Yayax Squad over to the HNE Headquarters. Ordo joined Kal, Fi and Jusik in extracting Doctor Ovolot Qail Uthan from her imprisonment at the Valorum Center. After Ko Sai's suicide, Uthan was Kal's next choice to work with all the cloning data they had accumulated. It was all due to Uthan's experience with the Fett genome, when she had previously sought to create a clone-killing nanovirus under the Separatists before being captured by Omega Squad and Tur-Mukan. Using the battle as an excuse, Jusik showed the nursing officer on duty a fake clearance, stating that they need to move the Uthan in case the Separatists took her. The extraction was successful and along the way, Jusik deviated from their plan and unexpectedly took another prisoner based on a hunch he had.

When he left Zey's office, Ordo found that Maze was following him. Testing their comradeship, Ordo offered Maze a piece of ruik root, and commented on his lack of retaliation to Ordo's tirade against Zey and the Jedi Order.

The Nulls rendezvoused with Gaib and T-KO on a freight terminal on the planet Ralltiir, aboard Vollen's ship Cornucopia. During the trip, Ordo was irritated by the rest of the Nulls when they kept dropping unsubtle hints to Vollen about marrying Kal. Though he also approved of the match between the two, he was worried that it was too soon for Vollen, who just learned that her husband, Terin Vollen, was dead.

When Niner filled Darman in on the extraction, Darman decided to stay in the army to gather intel as a spy. Knowing that his son Venku, now commonly referred to as Kad, was protected by the others, Darman believed that he could protect his son best by providing information from within the Empire. Despite having been told by Ordo that his son kept asking when he was coming home, Darman refused to change his decision and made his way back to the Special Operations barracks. Niner made it to the extraction point, and Ordo asked him for his commando armor. Ordo planned to slip into the barracks and extract Darman even if it meant physically dragging him out. But Niner surprised him by declaring that he too was staying to keep an eye out for Darman, and that he only came to the extraction point to give the Nulls a datachip secreted to him by Obrim, who was now part of Imperial Security.

Kal was shocked at seeing another Jedi brought to his secret refuge, and Ordo took charge of the matter by herding everyone inside the bastion. A small terse meeting ensued and Ordo almost got into a physical fight with Maze but was stopped by Jusik. Ordo ushered Kal out of the room to cool off but another fight began a few hours later between Kal and Vau, the latter incensed at the news that Kal was still accepting Jedi refugees. When the argument was over, Ordo asked Jusik if Zey was inclined to rebuild the Jedi Order, and if so, that Ordo was prepared to kill him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A decision regarding the Jedi on Kyrimorut was forced when Darman learned of their presence. Afraid that they would take Kad then train him as a Jedi, Darman took the news badly and severed his comlink connection to Kyrimorut. Kal felt guilty about the situation and thought of a way to make the Jedi leave without compromising his clan's security. Ordo and Wennen suggested that they have Jusik erase the Jedi's memories through the Force then pass them over to Altis. Kal considered the plan but Ordo was adamant about doing it, so much that he promised to do it himself without Kal's consent. Ordo believed that risking his life for a Jedi was a mockery of everything he and his clone brothers went through."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around this time, Uthan developed an immunogen that would act as an antidote from the virus FG36, which was also her own creation and was used by Palpatine to subdue her homeworld of Gibad. Seeking revenge, Uthan was convinced by Gilamar, who developed a relationship with her, that the best way she could hurt the Empire was to create an antidote for the virus, in case Palpatine decides to use the virus again. Uthan had Ordo and Kom'rk gather the entire clan inside their home where Uthan gave them all hypospray shots with her immunogen. She then tested the immunogen by exposing her own body to the FG36 virus, as Ordo, Gilamar and Scout watched. When Uthan survived the virus immersion, Kal immediately contacted Mandalore Fenn Shysa, who was the leader of the Mandalorian clans, and asked permission to spread the immunogen around Keldabe. With Shysa's consent, Kal, Gilamar, Vau, Jusik and all the Nulls went to Keldabe in pairs to cover as much ground as possible. Paired with Gilamar, Ordo watched over him as they walked through the streets of Keldabe, knowing that Gilamar was out looking for fellow Cuy'val Dar Dred Priest and Isabet Reau, both of whom Gilamar hated due to their leanings towards the Death Watch, which was a faction within the Mandalorians that believed they should conquer and rule over everybody else. While checking the other pairs progress via comlink, Ordo was momentarily separated from Gilamar. When Ordo managed to find him, Gilamar had already found Priest and was having a conversation regarding Priest's invitation to join the Death Watch. Gilamar introduced Ordo as his nephew\u2014not wanting to reveal that Ordo was a clone deserter\u2014and opted to move the conversation to a private place. The three of them continued the discussion near the Kelita river's side, and having heard enough information from Priest, Gilamar killed him by severing his femoral artery with a knife. Priest died in mere minutes due to severe blood loss and his body was disposed by Ordo and Gilamar by throwing it into the river. Later in the day, Ordo accompanied Kal in meeting Altis to discuss the turnover of their Jedi guests. Deciding to meet out in space rather than land on a planet, Ordo docked their Aggressor assault fighter along side Altis's own ship the Wookiee Gunner and welcomed the Jedi aboard. After the successful discussion, where in both Kal and Altis agreed to help each other out, Ordo programmed a course back to Mandalore."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With all the modifications the Kaminoans performed on the Jango Fett genome, Ordo was emotionally unstable, like the rest of the Nulls. Their capacity for loyalty was greatly enhanced; they were either one's best friend or worst enemy. An example was their unshakable devotion to their adoptive father, Kal Skirata, who was the only man from whom they ever took orders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ordo had fixed ideas on what a man should be; living his life according to Mandalorian customs and Kal's philosophy, as surmised by Besany Wennen when Ordo married her in a short Mandalorian ceremony. He shared Kal's empathy, especially in regards to the welfare of clone troopers. After Ordo encountered a wounded Arligan Zey after Order 66 was issued, he found out he could not summon any compassion for the Jedi, as he was not part of the small circle of individuals he cared about. Ordo could also be indifferent, yet merciful, when he performed assassinations, as shown by his promise of a clean death to Republic Intelligence agent Arbian J. Lemmeloth before quickly killing him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ordo had the habit of saying the most unexpected things on his mind, making Kal realize that he did not always know what Ordo was thinking. Ordo was very outspoken, having no problems saying things plainly and undiplomatically. There would be times when Kal was not certain how Ordo would react to situations, either surprising him with unexpected compassion and diplomacy, or becoming physically violent. When agitated, Ordo frequently balled one fist at his side. Of all the Nulls, Ordo was the only one who slept with a blanket covering his head, as if he wanted complete darkness. Kal later explained to Wennen that it was due to being exposed to live fire exercises when they were young."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ordo tried to accompany Kal as much as possible, never having been assigned to long missions like the other Nulls. This caused him uneasy feelings, as Ordo wanted to be on equal terms with all his brothers, preferring not to be seen as the favorite. Even though the rest of the Nulls had no problem acknowledging Ordo as the leader of the group since their birth. During times when there might be trouble, Ordo would always pair with Mereel\u2014who would fall into a sidekick role\u2014and take charge. Amongst all the Nulls, Ordo was the most serious one, never joking around like Mereel or Jaing. During missions, he would always be in constant alert and checking every detail. Nyreen Vollen once thought that Wennen suited Ordo perfectly as both of them shared the same traits, though any child of theirs would be unsmiling perfectionists that would need to have jokes explained to them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite being lethal and confident of his own skills, Kal observed that Ordo was vulnerable to his approval. Ordo tended to be very hard on himself whenever he made a mistake, as if failing would mean a death sentence, in spite of Kal's repeated assurances and encouragements. Wennen, in particular, thought that this was because Ordo and his brothers were almost killed by the Kaminoans for failing to reach their standards. Ordo knew that he lacked a certain awareness\u2014social blind spots\u2014that most Humans had and took for granted, though he was careful not to offend the feelings of those he cared about. Observing Darman's blossoming relationship with Etain Tur-Mukan, Ordo realized that the other Nulls could step beyond the community of clones as well without feeling adrift, while he personally found it distressing. He rationalized that it was due to his traumatic childhood experience with Ko Sai that he felt incapable of trusting a female."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ordo's favorite food was roba sausage, and his favorite color was dark red, choosing it as the color for his Mandalorian armor. Ordo had strong feelings of dislike for the Jedi Order, as he was raised not to think of them as his superiors. However, when Tur-Mukan was accidentally killed by a Jedi, his hatred of them grew, and he resolved to kill any remaining Jedi he encountered. Through the Force, Bardan Jusik felt Ordo's impression in the Force as someone with complete physical confidence and possessing an agile mind, coupled with a teenager's wild emotional swings; while Tur-Mukan described him as a disjointed turmoil of emotions, held in place by a ferociously intelligent logic. Amidst all the violence and anger, Tur-Mukan sensed the dark side in him, and it scared her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Skills and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Being a Null-class clone of Jango Fett, Ordo had all the skills and physical prowess of an Advanced Recon Commando. Owing to the experimental genotype the Kaminoans first developed, his build was slightly heavier than the troopers and commandos. His intelligence score was thirty-five percent higher than commando types and he had an eidetic memory which allowed him to remember facts with perfect recall.
