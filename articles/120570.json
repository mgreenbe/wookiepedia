Savi, an elder of the outpost, owned the company Savi & Son Salvage and its associated workshop near the middle of the outpost. The dirt path named after him led from Black Spire Outpost Market, past Savi's scrapyard on the outskirts of the outpost, and to the ancient ruins."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 34 ABY, Resistance spy Vi Moradi came to Batuu to establish an outpost, but was forced to crashland her starship in the forest after a collision. Salju, a local Batuuan and one of Savi's Gatherers, came to aid Moradi and led her to the outpost along Savi's Path. Moradi used the route for her work shifts at the scrapyard and for visits to the outpost, and it was also traveled by others after she established a Resistance holdout in the ruins. Eloc Throno, author of books such as the Traveler's Guide to Batuu, wrote that he would often wonder about Savi's son while walking Savi's Path."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
