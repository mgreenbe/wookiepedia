Deciding that a test was needed to try all which Dyshkava had learned, his Master assigned him his first solo mission to aid in negotiations on a distant planet. While the mission would challenge him mentally and emotionally, it was one of minimal physical risk. While Dyshkava could have completed the mission by calling his Master for aid, the arrogant Human was injured when a band of terrorists attacked the negotiations hall, and the boy gave into the dark side of the Force to complete the mission. The Master waited patiently for Dyshkava's return, but the young man never rejoined his mentor. Disappearing from the eye of even Grand Master Yoda, the Jedi Master and other members of the Order sought in vain for the wayward Dyshkava."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
