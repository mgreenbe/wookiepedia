Unit 07 and the other droids used Droch-class boarding ships and a meteor shower to land near the base. After sneaking in and killing several clone troopers, the droids hard-wired the \"all-clear\" signal, despite several clones managing to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clone Captain CT-7567 \"Rex\" and Clone Commander CC-2224 \"Cody\" arrived for a standard inspection, a droid disguised as a clone approached them in an effort to cancel the inspection. When Hevy alerted the clone officers with a droid attack flare, Rex shot and destroyed the disguised commando droid. They were subsequently ambushed and driven off the platform, with the Separatist droids believing that they were pulverized. Afterwards, Unit 07 and two other droids, 08 and 09, guarded the entrance to the base when Rex tricked Unit 07 into opening the doors for Unit 26, a droid that was previously destroyed. When the doors opened, Unit 07 and the other droids were destroyed, and the clones succeeded in recapturing the base, but not before a fleet of Separatist warships arrived overhead and deployed reinforcements to retake the base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unit 07 first appeared in \"Rookies,\" a 2008 episode of the first season of the TV-series Star Wars: The Clone Wars.
