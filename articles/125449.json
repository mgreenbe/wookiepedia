Using these illuminated objects, an operator could transmit visual messages from one signal station to another via a language known as semaphore. The Signal Corps, part of the militarized government of Alanciar, a continent on the planet Kesh, manned their civilization's signal stations as they kept watch for invasion from the Lost Tribe of Sith, who inhabited the continent of Keshtah to the west."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
