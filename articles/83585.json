He created the weapon using computer components found in the Great Temple on the moon on Yavin 4. These components included a focusing lens and an enhancement jewel that he used as the lightsaber crystal. When ignited, the blade was similar in shape to a club and nearly as wide as the 15-year-old Jaina Solo's arm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Construction"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Lowbacca, Jacen Solo and Jaina Solo's abduction by the Second Imperium's Shadow Academy and their rescue by  Tenel Ka Djo and Luke Skywalker in 23 ABY, Skywalker determined that his four young students were ready to construct their own lightsabers.
