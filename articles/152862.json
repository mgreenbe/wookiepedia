This droid gunship was ordered to take out the rebel resistance but after the arrival of Hondo Ohnaka with rocket launchers, the rebels were able to overpower all of the droid gunships and shoot them down. This gunship was shot down by Saw Gerrera and it crash landed into the cliff side where Saw's sister and King Ramsis Dendup were. Unknown to the group, this gunship was still operational and while Ahsoka Tano attempted to lift Steela to safety with the force, the gunship fired its weapons, injuring Ahsoka and causing her to drop Steela to her death. Lux Bonteri managed to shoot the turret of the gunship and fully disabled the craft before it could harm anyone else."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
