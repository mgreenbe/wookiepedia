In most of the galaxy, memory wipes were used on droids. All databanks, except for basic factory-installed programming, were \"wiped\" clean. A memory wipe was performed with a memory flush unit. Sentient individuals could also undergo a memory wipe. It was also possible to wipe the memories of shipboard computer systems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Purpose"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Through their everyday experiences, droids would gradually begin to develop personality and independence, even overriding their programming. Most droid owners did not want this, so they prevented it by performing regular memory wipes. Droids tended to dread the procedure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some evidence, however, suggested that not performing memory wipes could have beneficial effects. One such benefit was that the droid became better at inferring the wishes of its master, increasing its efficiency and accuracy. Also, droids with accumulated memories were often more effective because of their increased practical knowledge and real-world familiarity. Technicians working on Luke Skywalker's X-wing found that because Skywalker refused to wipe R2-D2's memory, the droid was needed to decipher diagnostics from the X-wing; at the same time, communication between Artoo and the ship had greatly improved over time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Similarly, Skywalker refused to perform regular memory wipes on the computer of the X-wing itself, despite it being standard New Republic procedure. As such, because the computer had spent much time communicating with R2-D2, it began to model itself after R2-D2's personality. This resulted in excellent operational speed and efficiency, but had the side effect that maintenance computers were no longer able to communicate with it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The periodic application of memory wipes became commonplace sometime after 200 BBY, when a cybersociologist of the Baobab Merchant Fleet accidentally created a personality algorithm that ran rampant as a virus through the droid population."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the days of the Old Republic a criminal organization called the Syndicat created a memory-wiping device for living beings. The Syndicat used this device to wipe the memories of the natives of Phindar who defied them, as a punishment. Obi-Wan Kenobi nearly had his memory erased, however, after surrounding his memories with the Force, he became the only being to ever withstand the memory wipe. It was destroyed by the natives in the battle that brought the end of the Syndicat in 44 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bail Organa ordered Raymus Antilles to wipe C-3PO's memory to ensure the true lineage of Leia Organa remained unknown. However, an image of a nine-year-old boy\u2014the droid's maker, Anakin Skywalker\u2014somehow survived the wipe. Years later, after the mention of Obi-Wan Kenobi's name, Owen Lars told Luke Skywalker to wipe the memory of two recently acquired droids\u2014Threepio and Artoo\u2014as part of a routine procedure. The wipe, however, was never performed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wedge Antilles had the memories of his astromech droid, Mynock, wiped after finding that in battle situations the droid's screaming was too much of a distraction. The technicians wiped Mynock's memory, and made a number of other improvements which resulted in the droid being re-designated R5-G8. Wedge then renamed the droid Gate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In one instance, Kodir of Kuhlvult, a Kuati noblewoman, secretly arranged to have a memory wipe performed on her sister, Kateel of Kuhlvult, who did not support Kodir's ambitions to seize control of Kuat Drive Yards. However, the intermediary responsible for arranging the procedure fleeced Kodir by pocketing her credits and attempting to perform the memory wipe independently rather than hiring a specialist. That decision resulted in Kateel slowly but surely regaining her memory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
