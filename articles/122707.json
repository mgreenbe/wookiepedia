It was located a relatively short distance east of the Jawa Mountain Fortress. Sometime following 0 BBY, Ephant Mon tasked a spacer with going to the compound, and disrupting Sennex's operations. The spacer succeeded in doing so by killing a swath of Sennex foot soldiers, including at least sixteen of their pirates, six slave masters, and nine guards. The spacer also obtained key chips from the guards and wiped the central computer of the compound of all information."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sennex Compound was a location in the 2003 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, prior to the game's closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
