The Gobindi discovered a cure, but failed to administer it quickly enough to survive. Thriving in hot and humid environments, the virus required a liquid medium to move from one host to another, thus remaining mildly contagious at best. Imperial scientists discovered a way to allow the virus to move through the air and developed it into a biological weapon. The virus itself resembled a tiny, horned eel that wrapped its host in a coating of green slime to maintain its environment. Covered in the slime, the host could continue to move about, spreading the virus. The Empire's plan to use the virus as a weapon was ultimately foiled."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
