In 3963 BBY the Covenant assigned Morne a mission to retrieve the Muur Talisman, an artifact owned generations prior by the Sith Lord Karness Muur that gave the wearer control over the mutant rakghoul creatures. Furthermore, Morne was tasked to bring fugitive Padawan Zayne Carrick to justice. Over the course of her mission, however, she came to doubt Carrick's culpability in the Padawan Massacre of Taris, for which he had been implicated by the members of the First WatchCircle of the Covenant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As she fought through the obstructions to her mission, including the unexpected outbreak of the Rakghoul Plague on the planet Jebble and her own doubts about Carrick, Morne fell under the possession of the Muur Talisman. In order to protect the galaxy from herself, Morne allowed Carrick to seal her in Dreypa's Oubliette. She would remain there in stasis until 19 BBY, when the Sith Lord Darth Vader obtained the oubliette and released her. She emerged haunted by the spirit of Karness Muur and discovered that the Sith ruled the galaxy in the new era she found herself in. Enraged at this discovery, Morne dueled Vader, but after being defeated used the Muur Talisman to force him to retreat. For approximately nineteen years afterward she lived secluded on a desolate moon, until she was visited by a company of elite stormtroopers, all of whom she turned into rakghouls in a moment of temporary insanity. Soon after, Rebel Alliance leaders Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa conducted a mission to recover what they thought to be a secret Imperial weapon, but was in fact, Morne.

She then met bounty hunter Cade Skywalker, and after witnessing him cure himself of the rakghoul plague with the Force, joined Skywalker in his plan to assassinate the current Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Krayt. Their quest took them to the planet Had Abbadon, where Morne allowed for the knowledge of Skywalker's presence in the Deep Core to reach Krayt. He arrived and a battle ensued, ultimately resulting in his defeat to the strike team and death at the hands of his own servent Darth Wyyrlok. With the Dark Lord finally eliminated, Morne focused on her own dilemma: the fear that the Sith spirit trapped inside her would soon dominate her completely.

Four distinct individuals also appeared in the vision: former Jedi Padawan Zayne Carrick, a tall individual encased in black full-body armor, and two young blond haired men, one of whom was clad in a long brown coat. Aside from Zayne Carrick, the Covenant members did not know or recognize the latter three individuals. In response to the vision, Lucien contacted Morne and gave her the task of finding the Muur Talisman, which they believed to be on Taris, as the Tarisian Undercity was the only known location of the Rakghoul Plague.

However, Lucien Draay's own apprentice, Zayne Carrick, escaped. To prevent the Covenant from exposure, the WatchCircle placed the blame for the killings on Carrick and ordered his elimination.

Despite Morne's expressed disdain for their company, Carrick and Hierogryph accompanied her as she continued to navigate the Undercity in the hopes that she would lead them off-planet and provide a route to their friends on the spaceship Moomo Williwaw. The precarious environment that the group found themselves in, combined with Carrick and Hierogryph's continued loud squabbling, led an exasperated Morne to wonder how it would have been possible for Carrick to kill anyone.

Once inside, Morne concluded that Carrick should warn the Republic about the impending attack on Alderaan while she retrieved the Talisman.

After defeating the rakghouls, Morne and Carrick tried to find a way out of the citadel.

While Carrick's back was turned, Morne activated her lightsaber to kill him, but stopped when he made contact with the Mandalorian Field Marshal, Cassus Fett, who was en route to Jebble with transports for the invasion. Carrick alerted Fett to the presence of the Rakghoul Plague and cautioned him not to land or allow any more of his people to disembark from their ships. Morne realized that Carrick was concerned for all life, both citizens of the Republic and Mandalorians, which gave her pause.

Pulsipher then threatened to encase him in a Sith artifact known as Dreypa's Oubliette; Carrick would be put into infinite stasis, and no sensor would be able to penetrate the Oubliette to detect his existence. The scientist's interrogation was interrupted when the Talisman detached itself from the Mandalorian; the rakghouls, now lacking a controlling influence, turned on Pulsipher and killed him.

Morne used her rakghouls to locate Hierogryph as well as Carrick's lightsaber, and had both brought to them. An indignant Hierogryph revealed to Carrick that Morne was an agent for the Covenant and was under orders from Lucien Draay.

Furthermore, after realizing that she was a threat\u2014by virtue of being bonded with the Talisman\u2014Morne allowed herself to be sealed in Dreypa's Oubliette, even while knowing that it would be a torture chamber for her. Nearly four thousand years later, after being awakened by Darth Vader, she risked losing control over herself by tapping into the power of the Talisman in order to prevent Vader from claiming it for his own. Twenty years later, Morne's duel with Vader's son, Luke Skywalker, resulted in the Muur Talisman leaving her, giving her freedom from Karness Muur. Nevertheless, she realized that she was the only one who was capable of imprisoning the spirit of Muur. When asked by Cade Skywalker a century later why she had not simply buried the Sith artifact somewhere, Morne replied that she could not take the chance that someone weaker than herself would find it and set loose an army of rakghouls upon the galaxy. Morne also explained that she had found methods of imprisoning the spirit of Muur within herself and had gone into self-exile for the protection of all."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Morne did not make friends, she did become allies with people who made an impression on her, giving them her trust. Zayne Carrick had made an impression on her while they were on Jebble, and before she was sealed in the oubliette, Morne asked him to transport her to the Covenant's secret storehouse for Sith artifacts on Odryn, where she hoped that researchers would be able to help her. She trusted him to somehow find a way to help her affliction and gave him her key to the storehouse. Upon her awakening by Lord Vader, and learning the fate of the galaxy, Morne was despondent, believing that Carrick had failed her. Not until the death of Lord Krayt on Had Abbadon did she finally understand that Zayne had not failed her in that he had sent Cade Skywalker to help her. Morne judged Skywalker strong enough to withstand Karness Muur, and trusting him to destroy the Muur Talisman, she allowed Skywalker to kill her and end her imprisonment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a Shadow, Celeste Morne was trained to live her life as a sleeper agent for the Covenant, living her daily life until summoned for a mission. She was secretive and unorthodox, taking pains to avoid dressing as a Jedi, and she rarely used her lightsaber in public. In order to fulfill her duty and follow the Covenant's mandate in using all means necessary to bring about a successful conclusion to an assignment, Morne was skilled in using many forms of subterfuge, both with the Force and without. Fluent in the Bocce language, Morne also developed an ability to move quietly in many types of environments, such as the Undercity on Taris, and the ice fields of Jebble. Calling upon her Force powers, Morne was proficient in persuading or confusing her enemies and opponents into following her commands; these actions could include performing a specific action, as she did with Pulsipher aboard the Mar'eyce, or clouding an individual's perception so as to be able to move about undetected, a form of Force cloak referred to as Force Haze. Likewise, Morne could communicate with individuals through the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During combat, Morne was skilled in using a lightsaber, often using the Force to gain a small height advantage over her enemies and to augment the strength of her blows. Furthermore, she was talented with the use of telekinesis, using the Force power to hurl enemies and objects away from her. Morne also had the ability to use the Force as protection from an opponent's attacks. After bonding with the Muur Talisman, Morne gained the ability to employ Sith magic in transforming certain species into rakghouls and directing the mutants according to her will.

John Ostrander, the writer for the Legacy series, explained that Morne was created early on in the conception of the story arc for it was recognized that in order to unify the crossover, a single character that the readers could identify with was needed. Furthermore, it was felt that a single character would eliminate the need for elaborate explanations as to the fate of the Muur Talisman; the Talisman could have created a new vessel during each of the eras, but then the story would have had to explain their disappearance as well as the Talisman's. The developers had also decided that with a new character they would have the opportunity to explore the protagonist's personality and ultimately decide the manner in which the character would exit the Star Wars universe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Morne made her first appearance in a scene in which she is fighting a group of rakghouls in Knights of the Old Republic 25, drawn by artist Scott Hepburn.
