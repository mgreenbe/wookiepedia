The Sith Lord Count Dooku, head of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, owned at least two FA-4 pilot droids, which he used onboard his Punworcca 116-class interstellar sloop solar sailer. One droid piloted the Sith from the planet Geonosis to the planet Coruscant after the Separatists' defeat during the First Battle of Geonosis. This droid was destroyed when Dooku crashed onto the planet Vanqor. The pirate Hondo Ohnaka later held the droid's face plate. At some point afterwards Dooku would acquire another of this droid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "FA-4 units also worked on Coruscant itself, and around the time of the Battle of Coruscant, these droids bustled around the Senate Building and the Senate Office Building."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
