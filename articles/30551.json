Mostly, the Coruscant Guard was found protecting vital infrastructure and government buildings as well as serving as guards at the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center.

The Guard also served as peacekeepers, assisting Coruscant's civilian police, the Coruscant Security Force (CSF). They coordinated their activities with them through the Homeworld Security Command and deployed riot clone troopers to assist the CSF in patrolling the streets of Galactic City.

The Guard remained a separate organization from the Stormtrooper Command structure as well as from the stormtroopers assigned to the CSF. They also received distinct crimson-colored armor that was light, yet heavily padded, and made them into a easily recognized presence. The Guards became ruthless symbols of Palpatine's power, not only on Coruscant, but a few other select Core Worlds as well.

The Guard itself consisted of clone shock troopers, so called because of their focus on lighting fast responses. Within the Guard, shock troopers could be assigned to two specialized duties. One was the riot clone troopers who were trained in crowd dispersal and urban patrol. Squads of riot troopers were always ready for deployment, stationed in barracks across Galactic City. The second was the Diplomatic Escort Group duty during which troopers charged with protecting Republic officials on key missions. The Diplomatic Escort Group was led by a clone commander, though he was subordinate to the overall commander of the Guard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The primary duty of the Coruscant Guard was the security of Coruscant, but more importantly the safety of the galactic government. This task gave the Guard and its commander a wide jurisdiction and far reaching authority.

Under the Galactic Empire, the authority of the Guard was expanded yet their duties and organization changed little. Though composed of specially trained stormtroopers, the Coruscant Guard remained separate from the overall command structure of the Stormtrooper Corps. They were given primacy on all investigations and police activity on Coruscant, though they were few in number. As such, general policing was still carried out primarily by the CSF."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Armor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a unit of the Grand Army, the Coruscant Guard originally used the Phase I clone trooper armor. The Grand Army at first used colors on armor to designate military rank. The Coruscant Guard was one of the first divisions to use color to designate unit affiliation rather than rank. As such, all shock troopers had crimson markings on their armor, crimson being the color of Coruscant and the Republic government. Additionally, the symbol of the Galactic Senate was painted on the armor. While it was normally situated at the middle of the chest plate, it was also at times painted on shoulder or upper arm plates. Various troopers also made additional modifications to their armor, a trait that would become increasingly common among the Grand army."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Coruscant Guard later adopted the new Phase II clone trooper armor along with the rest of the army.

Additionally, the Senate symbol was removed from the armor plates of the shock troopers. A notable exception was the markings present on the armor of the Guard commander which, while crimson as before, was a different pattern then the rest of the Guard, and retained the Senate's symbol on its shoulder plates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Imperial era, the Coruscant Guard was issued distinctive armor. Unique to only members of the Guard and in keeping with the established precedent, the armor was colored completely in crimson. Underneath, Guards wore a black body glove suit. In contrast to the plastoid Stormtrooper armor worn by other units, it was designed for urban policing. Heavily padded, yet light and versatile, the armor protected Guards from physical attacks and the majority of weapons they were expected to encounter. The helmets worn by the Guards were lined with advanced sensors, which allowed them to work in complete darkness. They also contained a comlink scrambler for communication with fellow personnel.

For general duties, the shock troopers carried the DC-15A blaster rifles, DC-15Ss, and thermal detonators. Coruscant Guards were also issued DC-17 hand blasters that could be carried as side arms. For special missions and military expeditions, troopers could carry missile launchers such as the RPS-6 rocket launcher and Z-6 rotary blaster cannons. As the Coruscant Guard was not only a military unit but primarily a peacekeeper force, the riot clone trooper units that patrolled various areas of Coruscant were armed with non-lethal weapons. This included riot shields and stun batons. Under the Empire, they received new weapons with Merr-Sonn Munitions, Inc. providing much of their armory. While Guards carried blaster pistol side arms and blaster rifles, they were well known to utilize Merr-Sonn taser staves on patrol. The taser stave had variable power settings and was capable of delivering a lethal or incapacitating charge when it struck its target. For major riots or crowd control situations, Coruscant Guards also carried the more advanced Merr-Sonn R-88 Suppressor riot rifle. The rifle was well liked by both the Guard and the CSF as a crowd control device."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While much of the Coruscant Guard was stationed at various posts around the planet, the shock troops lived up to their name as a rapid response force. To this end, the Guard made use of the Low Altitude Assault Transport (LAAT) favored by the Grand Army. The LAAT was able to provide the Guard with a rapid deployment and patrol craft. Additionally, thought they did not always do so, the Guard could procure Republic police gunships from the CSF and utilize them during missions or as patrol craft. The police gunship was so successful it saw continued use during the Empire. During that time, the Guard also changed over to using the Imperial Rapid Deployment Airspeeder as their primary form of transportation. It allowed them to deploy several Guards as a unit as had their other troop transports. For pacifying operations against unruly mobs, the Coruscant Guard favored the All Terrain Recon Transports.

The Imperial Security Bureau, when conducting their own investigations into criminal or Rebel activity, agents would call upon the Guard to assist them. Also, the Coruscant Ministry of Ingress (CMoI) was brought firmly under the control of the Coruscant Guard.
