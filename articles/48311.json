Finn fought in the defense of his homeworld, an effort which ultimately failed, although he was able to evacuate safely from Artorias due to the timely assistance of the Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. The rest of his family did not fare as well; his sister and mother were captured, while his father chose to remain on Artorias to lead a guerrilla resistance.

Finn Galfridian, however, chafed under this peaceful existence, and spent his spare time taking physical risks under the supervision of his droid Prowl to alleviate his boredom. It was just after one of his exercises when the Yuuzhan Vong, an aggressive race of extra-galactic invaders, assaulted the planet. The Yuuzhan Vong had recently attacked the galaxy, destroying the planet of Sernpidal in the process.

Although the two Galfridians and the evacuees were able to reach the hangar, the Yuuzhan Vong kept the building under siege. The refugees were unable to escape on the ships in the hangar since they had been sabotaged by a Yuuzhan Vong agent.

As the refugees piled onto New Republic evacuation ships, Finn protested to Skywalker that he had no idea how to lead, but Skywalker assured him that if he pretended to know what he was doing, the people would follow him. Finn also demonstrated his Force affinity to Skywalker when he sensed his mother and sister being herded toward a Yuuzhan Vong slaveship. This prompted the Jedi Master to ask Finn to come to his Jedi academy on Yavin 4, which Finn accepted.

Despite some initial awkwardness around Jaina, Finn quickly showed his mettle in a practice duel with her. Jaina warned Finn of the dangers of hatred and of falling to the dark side of the Force after he expressed his worry and anger at fate of his planet and family. They were interrupted by Anakin Solo, who had heard a large noise issuing from a nearby cave.

It was shortly after his first wife, the mother of Finn and Kaye, had died and he and a group of soldiers went to remove a slaver named Dowron from the planet. Dowron had Nina as a slave and after Caled freed her she killed Dowron with her bare hands.
