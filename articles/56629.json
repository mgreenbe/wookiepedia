The Muur Talisman, the first of the amulets created by Syn, was gifted to her fellow Jen'jidai Karness Muur, while the second\u2014the Dreypa Talisman\u2014was crafted specifically for Baron Remulus Dreypa. According to her chronicle, Syn had intended to create the third for her own personal use, though the specific details of its creation were unknown to later Force users.
