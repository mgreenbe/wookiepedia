Fighting alongside Captain Dal, Senessa and the rest of the crew were saved by a Jedi Knight and Kira Carsen. After reclaiming the ship, Senessa and Dal explained how Darth Angral combined the Planet Prison, Shock Drum, and Death Mark into a single weapon: the Desolator and used it to destroy the planet Uphrades. When Doctor Senessa detected lifeforms on the planet, meaning there were survivors, Dal argued that if the Daybreaker landed on the planet, the ion field that had been generated by the Planet Prison component of the Desolator would destroy the ship's engines and trap them there. The captain attempted to convince the Knight to let them go by bribing the Jedi with the frigate's medical supplies, but the Knight instead informed Senessa of Dal's treachery. Senessa was shocked that Dal would break his oath to the Republic. After Dal left in an escape pod, Senessa navigated the Daybreaker through the debris field and landed on what was left of Uphrades' surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, she sent a message to the Jedi, stating that there were indeed hundreds of survivors on the planet. It would take a long time for the ion field to dissipate, but thanks to the Daybreaker's medical supplies, most of them would be able to survive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
