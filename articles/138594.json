Like the other TIE Experimentals, the M3 was remotely controlled by a modified Beta-class ETR-3 escort transport.

The lure was successful, and the Z-95's, armed with experimental ion pulse warheads, managed to disable or destroy the entire Imperial attack force. The TIEs were found to be unmanned, and the life-support systems on the control craft were rigged to malfunction as soon as the transports were disabled. Renegade Squadron also made an attempt to steal a vessel of this class."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, when the Alliance ordered an intelligence-gathering strike on a TIE Experimental production facility, several waves of M3 fighters were found in the station's defense screen.

They were also present at the main research facility, defending the hangar ship Sardis and space station Obsidian."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the destruction of space platform Obsidian, no TIE Experimental fighters were seen again."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
