Launching in the freighter Millennium Falcon from an Alliance base in an asteroid field, Rebel-allied smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca recovered the Talisman and discovered that it produced a sleeping virus that rendered Humans unconscious. Solo was indeed a Human, and his Wookiee co-pilot accordingly hung his prone form upside-down, as preventing blood from rushing to the head was the only way to keep him alive. Chewbacca also destroyed the Talisman."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Concurrently, Lord Darth Vader of the Empire sent the bounty hunter Boba Fett to befriend the Rebels and discover the location of their hidden base. During a transmission between Lord Vader and the bounty hunter, R2-D2 received the transmission, finding out Boba Fett was working for Vader.  When Chewbacca and Fett returned, R2 warned them of the transmission he received. Fett then fled the scene, and Solo woke up."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
