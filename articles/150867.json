During the High Republic Era, Jedi Master Sskeer hung one pendant from the top of one of the Needles on Shuraden, challenging his Padawan Keeve Trennis to find it for her Jedi Trials. The arrival of a swarm of ridadi, giant star-locusts, disrupted Trennis' attempts, and she gave up trying to locate the pendant in favour of saving a nearby Ximpi city which was threatened by the swarm, thinking to herself that given the damage the ridadi had done to the Needles, the pendant was probably no longer where Sskeer had left it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Tythonian pendant was first mentioned in the 2021 comic book The High Republic 1."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
