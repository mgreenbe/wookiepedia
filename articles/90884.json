Soon afterwards, Marec was killed when his ship suffered a hull breach, leaving Vel to raise Gev alone. Vel, however, was constantly hunting for the famous bounty hunter and leader of the Mandalorian clans Boba Fett, who had deserted Vel and her mother Sintas when Ailyn was still a child, fostering a desire for revenge in his daughter.

At one point in the course of her career, Gev encountered former ARC clone trooper Jaing Skirata during an ill-fated mission, though Gev only knew him by his last name. Skirata and Gev were both after the same target, and eventually met. When they met, Skirata claimed that he had fought in the Clone Wars. At one point prior to 40 ABY, Gev was married, but that relationship ended. Gev also assisted her mother in her search for Boba Fett, hoping to aid Vel in her revenge.

Afterwards, Gev, and a group of Mandalorian commandos assembled by Goran Beviin met in the Zerria's Bar bar on Drall two days later.

It was in the Zerria bar that Gev met her future husband, Mandalorian warrior Ghes Orade, for the first time. The two went to Corellia, where they were met at the spaceport by Dur Gejjen, a rising Corellian politician, who took them to Sal-Solo's office. During the meeting, Fett told the Mandalorians of Sal-Solo's offer. Gev, Fett, and the rest of the Mandalorians went to Corellia to speak with Sal-Solo, who outlined the offer. On the way out of their meeting with Sal-Solo, they were pulled aside by Gejjen, who made a counteroffer. Gejjen was scheming to eliminate Sal-Solo, and needed a contract killer. He offered Fett the job, and Fett accepted, bringing Gev along with him. Afterwards, Gev and Fett approached ex-smuggler and Sal-Solo's cousin, Han Solo, offering their help to assassinate Sal-Solo, as Han Solo was already plotting to kill him. However, due to the history that Solo had with Fett, he was mistrustful of the bounty hunter. Solo became convinced that Fett was trying to trap and kill him when he saw Gev and recognized her as Ailyn Vel's daughter, who had previously been after Solo and his family.

Stricken, Gev pulled her blaster out, aiming it at Fett. However, Organa Solo used the Force to pull the blaster away from Gev before she could fire a shot. Upon losing her blaster, Gev revealed her true intentions for traveling with Fett; she wanted to return him to Vel, so that she could kill him once and for all. Since Vel was dead, Gev wanted to kill Fett to complete her mother's mission. Gev broke down in tears upon divulging her motives, and had to be calmed down by the Solos. Afterwards, Vel's body was returned to Fett and Gev, and Gev decided to bring her mother's corpse back to Mandalore.

Once they landed on Bador, the two entered a local establishment known as the Paradise Cantina. The barkeeper and employees of the cantina, however, were hostile to the two, as the last Mandalorian to enter the cantina, Skirata, had killed a local crime boss named Cherit. The hostility from the bartender led to an all out brawl, with the Mandalorians winning.

Meanwhile, Fett finally used the Ko Sai data provided to him by Skirata to overcome his illness. Gev attended his medical procedure with Orade, and was introduced to Venku Skirata, also known as Kad'ika. In a meeting with Venku Skirata and his friend Gotab in a Keldabe tapcafe, Fett asked Gotab if he could psychometrically read the Heart of Fire pendant. Gotab read the pendant, and discovered the location of Sintas Vel. According to Gotab's readings, Vel had been on the planet Phaeda, after an unsuccessful fight with a crime lord named Rezodar.

However, by investigating further, Gev found out that Vel's body, frozen within a carbonite slab, was among these objects. Gev and Fett traveled to Phaeda together in the Slave I, intending to bring Vel back to Mandalore and thaw her from her carbonite slumber, before helping her rehabilitate. On route to Phaeda, Gev was excited that she would be able to meet her grandmother for the first time, while Fett dreaded seeing the woman he had abandoned years before. Once on Phaeda, they went to the planet's Registry of Testaments and Legacies, where Vel had been stored, and retrieved her body. The pair returned to Mandalore, where Vel was unfrozen. Over the next few months, Gev helped care for her grandmother as she dealt with memory loss and dementia caused by her years in carbonite. While Vel was under her granddaughter's care, Gev also gave her the Heart of Fire. Eventually, with the help of Gotab, Vel was able to fully recover both physically and mentally, and forgave Fett for leaving her and Ailyn.

When the bounty hunter was later incarcerated on the prison deck of the Anakin Solo, she indicated to Jaina Solo that she would rather be put out of her misery than undergo further interrogation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mirta Gev was created by author Karen Traviss for her novel Legacy of the Force: Bloodlines, the second book of the Star Wars: Legacy of the Force series. Before appearing in Bloodlines, a picture of Gev was included in the Star Wars Insider 86 article, The Mandalorians: People and Culture, which showed an illustration of a Mandalorian wedding by Tom Hodges. Although the article did not identify the Mandalorians in the picture, the illustration was later included in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia as a representation of Gev and her husband getting married. During the creation of the character, Gev was originally named Vessin Ghif, but this was changed to Mirta Gev before publication. After her first appearance, Gev appeared in Traviss' next two novels, Legacy of the Force: Sacrifice and Legacy of the Force: Revelation. Gev also was featured in the final novel of Legacy of the Force, Legacy of the Force: Invincible, written by Troy Denning. She was later included as an antagonist in Denning's follow-up novel to the Fate of the Jedi series, Crucible."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After her first depiction in Star Wars Insider, several sketches of Mirta Gev were included in Topps' 2011 Topps Star Wars Galaxy Series 6. Several sketch cards of Mirta Gev by Shea Standefer showed her with the braids in her hair that were shown in the original Tom Hodges image. However, this hairstyle was not included when Gev was illustrated for inclusion in The Essential Reader's Companion. An image of Gev by Brian Rood depicted her with the dark hair that previous illustrations had shown, but did not include the braids. An additional image from the book by Joe Corroney which depicted her first appearance in Bloodlines also failed to include the braids that previous drawings had established. In Gev's first depiction in Star Wars Insider 86, she is shown with armor painted orange and yellow and shaped for her feminine figure, but in Bloodlines, Gev's armor is described as \"practical\" with \"no concessions to feminine fashion whatsoever.\" In the sketches by Shea Standefer, she included the yellow color to Gev's armor. However, this was not included in the illustrations in The Essential Reader's Companion, as they showed her with simple gray armor that matched her description in Legacy of the Force. In Crucible, Denning mentions that Gev is outfitted in orange and gray armor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
