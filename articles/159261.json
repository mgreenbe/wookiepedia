The Guild attempted to blackmail Kayl as well as attack the skylane network around the Senate Building. Kayl responded by sending a contingent of police officers with the Coruscant Security Force under the command of CSF Chief of Security Captain Winborn. With the assistance of an individual, the CSF were able to prevent the attack. However a recording of Kayl arguing with a leader of the Guild was found. The individual who assisted the CSF confronted her and after some debate called a session of the Senate to disclose her actions. After the session, Kayl resigned from her position."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vanara Kayl appears in the Star Wars: The Old Republic Coruscant quest called \"Crisis in Galactic City\".
