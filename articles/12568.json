They held meetings in the Merchant Council chamber, during which they assigned missions to junior members. Mungo Baobab's father was a member of the council. In 15 BBY, the council ordered Mungo Baobab to undertake a mission to the planet Hrill. Baobab ignored the order and instead traveled to the Roon system to find the fabled Roonstones. He brought the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO with him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
