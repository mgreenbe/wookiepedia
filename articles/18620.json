The motif first appeared in \"Chapter 14: The Tragedy,\" an episode of The Mandalorian directed by Robert Rodriguez, a filmmaker known for taking the lead in his movies' musical scores. While Fett already has a leitmotif in the Star Wars saga composed by John Williams, Rodriguez had established the tone of Boba Fett's new leitmotif by the time composer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson began working on the episode, and the two collaborated in playing with raw sound effects as their guide for the motif over Zoom sessions. For the final outcome of the motif, G\u00f6ransson added sounds of didgeridoo and human breath to distort \"some kind of war horn\" that the episode director featured."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Boba Fett's motif is used in \"Chapter 14: The Tragedy\" as well as the post-credits scene of \"Chapter 16: The Rescue,\" the second season finale of The Mandalorian.
