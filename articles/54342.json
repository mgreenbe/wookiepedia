The Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure's LO-KD57 luxury barge, the Khetanna, was equipped with Gi/9 cannons mounted on the rails of the sail barge's top deck. As the weapons were removable, the exact number of cannons on the ship varied, but there were typically twenty mounted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The weapons saw use during a skirmish above the Great Pit of Carkoon on the planet Tatooine when a group of Jabba's prisoners freed themselves and attacked the Hutt's forces. As the fighting broke out, the Nikto Vizam mounted a Gi/9 on the Khetanna's rails and opened fire on the Bantha-II cargo skiff carrying the prisoners. A human member of the sail barge's crew also manned a cannon later in the conflict and fired on the same skiff."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gi/9 antipersonnel laser cannons first appeared in the 1983 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi.
