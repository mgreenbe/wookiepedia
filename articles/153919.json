During the Imperial Era, the Mon Cala monarchy's trade fleet was commandeered by the Galactic Empire and designated as the Mon Cala Imperial Trade Fleet, which contained at least one of these starships. After a recording of Mon Calamari King Lee-Char's final words before being killed by the Empire, the Mon Cala fleet, including one vessel of this class, mutinied, but was soon met by an Imperial fleet led by Admiral Meori. The starship had at least fourteen engine units."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This model of Mon Calamari starship first appeared in Star Wars 48, released in 2018 and was written by Kieron Gillen and illustrated by Salvador Larroca.
