The transport was on standby in the Nebulon-B2 frigate Ludwick to capture Rebel fugitives aboard Cargo container CRM908A which was inside a base used by Pirates. When Ludwick launched an assault on the base to destroy it, Imperial Ace Maarek Stele scanned the containers to find the desired container. The assault transport was launched and boarded the container to arrest the Rebels. The Pirate stronghold was destroyed to pave way for the construction of XQ3 Platform NL-1 in the Pakuuni system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tiger was used again with a second ship to board Modified corvettes Z-Oz to recover stolen Hyperdrive units from ZA-13 during the Zaarin insurrection."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
