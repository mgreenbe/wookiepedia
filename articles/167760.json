He had a reputation of never bringing in a bounty alive. He was sent by Rogun to find Ace on Nar Shaddaa and was to bring the smuggler back to him in pieces. When he attempted to capture the smuggler aboard Drooga's pleasure barge, the wookiee Bowdaar stepped in, returning the favor after the smuggler previously helped him fight a group of Kaleesh warriors. Zank was killed in the fight that ensued, much to Drooga's entertainment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
