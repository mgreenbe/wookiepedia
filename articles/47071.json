For a time he was the lone pilot stationed at a rebel base on Cassidode VI, before transferring to join Blue Squadron under General Antoc Merrick at the rebel headquarters on the moon Yavin 4. In 0 BBY, he participated in a mission to kill Imperial scientist Galen Erso on the planet Eadu.

The split squadron then fought against the Empire on both sides of the gate and suffered several casualties, but the plans were finally transmitted to the fleet, and the surviving Blue Squadron pilots retreated back to Yavin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Engagement at Eadu"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Farns Monsbee was a human male who served the Rebel Alliance as a pilot during the Galactic Civil War against the Galactic Empire. For a period of his service, he was the sole snubfighter pilot stationed at an ill-equipped rebel outpost on Cassidode VI, where he logged a large number of flying hours. Monsbee was eventually transferred to Blue Squadron, an unusually large starfighter squadron within the Massassi Group of rebels operating out of the Great Temple on the moon Yavin 4. While on the moon, he often served as a recon flier."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 0 BBY, Blue Squadron was under the command of General Antoc Merrick. After the Alliance lost contact with Intelligence officer Cassian Andor, who had been sent to kill the Imperial scientist Galen Erso on the planet Eadu, Blue Squadron was partially raised by General Davits Draven to complete the mission. Monsbee numbered among the pilots who participated in the mission and flew through the stone pillars of Eadu before opening fire on the landing platform of the secret Imperial laboratory where Erso was stationed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The attack landed a successful blow that led to Erso's death, after which Blue Squadron briefly engaged enemy TIE/ln space superiority starfighters and turrets before retreating. Monsbee and the rest of the squadron then returned with Andor and his team to Yavin, where a meeting of the Alliance Civil Government convened to discuss a potential attack on the Imperial base on the planet Scarif to steal the plans for the Empire's Death Star superweapon. However, the council ultimately decided that there would be no attack."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Scramble for Scarif"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the council's decision, the recently enlisted rebel Jyn Erso led a squad of Alliance operatives to Scarif to capture the Death Star plans by themselves. Soon thereafter, the entirety of Blue Squadron numbered among the forces that Alliance Admiral Raddus scrambled to aid the rebels on Scarif. Monsbee flew to the battle as Blue Five in a T-65B X-wing starfighter with an astromech droid bearing orange and silver plating."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon the reinforcements' arrival in space above Scarif, Raddus ordered Blue Squadron to quickly head to the planet's surface through the Imperial Shield Gate\u2014the only opening in the otherwise impenetrable planetary shield over Scarif\u2014so that it could aid Erso's squad. As Merrick ordered his pilots to follow him in, Monsbee made an observation that they would not have long before the Imperials closed the gate, thereby sealing the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Monsbee proved to be correct, as only seven of the squadron's X-wing starfighters and a single UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft made it through before the gate closed, with three Blue Squadron pilots dying as their X-wings impacted with the gate.

He was a keen historian and had a reputation for being chatty in the recreation room, a habit caused by his time in isolation on Cassidode VI. Monsbee had light skin, blue eyes, and blond hair."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a pilot of the Rebellion, Farns Monsbee was equipped with a blue flight suit, a white flight harness, a gray Diagnostech life support unit, and a dark-green K-22995 light flight helmet.

An X-wing carrying an astromech droid with the same orange coloring as Monsbee's droid can be seen among the fighters defending the Alliance Fleet once the Shield Gate has shut, although it is unclear if this is the same droid and therefore Monsbee's ship or not."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Farnaby initially turned down the role of Blue Five after being offered it over the phone by a producer, as he was in the middle of writing the film Paddington 2. However, after his writing partner, Paul King, told him to take the role despite their deadline, Farnaby accepted and filmed his X-wing cockpit scenes on a gimbal with a large screen around him. Farnaby is uncertain why he was chosen for the role but has stated that the makers of Rogue One were looking for characterful faces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
