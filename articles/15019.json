It was a failed attempt by the Galactic Alliance to reclaim the planet Duro from the Yuuzhan Vong. The battle lasted for over a day, as the Alliance fleet fought its way through the outer Duro system, only reaching serious resistance in the inner system, where Yuuzhan Vong reinforcements arrived. General Wedge Antilles ordered a retreat in order to protect Alliance forces at Fondor, the entire battle having been a feint to draw Yuuzhan Vong reinforcements from the battle there; however, the ships crewed by native Duros refused, and were destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
