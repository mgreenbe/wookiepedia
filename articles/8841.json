At one point the Poporov merchants of Armstiss rebelled against the Empire, and Captain Strayit and Lieutenant Zertik Strom of the Imperial Navy vessel Marshall Awe were sent to deal with them. The conflict was ended when Strom took a blaster bolt meant for Strayit, and then stuck a thermal detonator down the pants of the leader of the rebels, throwing him off a cliff into his supporters. The resultant explosion destroyed half the merchant stalls in the area, but discouraged any further defiance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Armstiss was first mentioned in the second part of Viva Space Vegas!
