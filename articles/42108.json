The ship had bridge stations that allowed the four-person crew to monitor and operate the E-9's systems. The crew quarters were located along the neck of the ship, and were large enough to be comfortable on long voyages for both the vessel's crew and up to four passengers; the crew and passengers could also avail themselves of a ship's lounge that had an autochef system, a hologame table, and other entertainment facilities. The main body of the ship held an engineering section and a three-deck cargo bay; this bay could hold a small repulsorlift vehicle, which could exit the ship through a ventral cargo elevator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A network of crawlways was built under the main deck that could reach almost any part of the ship, giving technicians easy access to ship's systems during flight. However, the only entry/exit point was through the gunwell in the fore of the cargo bay; entering the maintenance tunnels anywhere else would require cutting through the deck plating."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The E-9 Explorer's armament consisted of two laser cannons, one above and one below the ship's main hull. The designers believed this armament would provide sufficient defense, but owners of E-9s found that the weapon systems were easy to upgrade, and often opted to install double, quad, or heavy laser cannons in their stead; some even installed a proton torpedo launcher into the underside of the ship's nose. Such modifications were viewed by Loronar and the Empire as unnecessary at best, and in some cases deemed sufficient cause for the Empire to seize a ship so modified."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Loronar introduced the E-9 Explorer towards the end of the Clone Wars as an unarmored transport. In the face of tumultuous political times and the increasing market share of the Corellian Engineering Corporation's successful line of freighters, the E-9 was only able to achieve mild success. Loronar maintained support for the ship with the expectation that sales would improve, though they nearly discontinued the ship several times in the ensuing years. When Loronar followed the lead of other starship manufacturers and began weaponizing its offerings, the E-9 was one of the first to receive this treatment, and the change and subsequent advertising promotion raised sales figures and ensured the ship's survival."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, soon afterward, the Empire began cracking down on manufacturers that were adding armaments to their ships. Loronar pleaded with the Imperial Bureau of Shipyards and Construction and began a string of legal battles that again put E-9 production in jeopardy. Ultimately, Loronar secured permission to continue selling the vessel as an armed transport intended as an exploration vessel, justifying the ship's weapon loadout as required to defend itself away from Imperial protection."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Given a new direction by this justification, Loronar upgraded the ship's sensor suite and changed its marketing strategy. Although sales suffered somewhat, Loronar chose not to shy away from the good fortune of avoiding an Imperial production stoppage, and continued supporting the E-9 until several years after the rise of the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "E-9 Explorers in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "E-9 Explorers were most often encountered in unexplored star systems or in spaceports far removed from populous regions like the Core Worlds, in the hands of rugged crews of scouts seeking new planets and secrets. Other groups operating E-9 Explorers were small mercenary bands, using it as their primary mode of transportation; pirates, employing it to loot merchant and luxury transports; and merchants and wealthy individuals, who occasionally adopted E-9s as personal yachts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The E-9 Explorer originated on the website SWRPGNetwork before Wizards of the Coast canonized it in the Message to Spacers series of web articles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
