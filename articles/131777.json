The map comprised sectors of 10 systems (the number of sectors was customizable for either 10, 15 or 20), all known from the Star Wars universe. Some of them belonged to 'unknown' regions, and needed to be explored. The sectors on the game map did not correspond to the canon information otherwise available, so it was assumed that the location of various systems was arbitrary for gameplay.\nThe player assumed the role of an officer of either the Rebellion or the Empire. He was called to manage command and maintenance, like colonization, diplomacy, creation of buildings and units, supervising of mines and resources, building and assigning of fleets, conversion of systems to one's own side, recruiting of characters, (60 in the game, both from the movies and the Expanded Universe) and dispatching characters or units to systems (up to 200 available) or fleets."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Story"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The game started right after the Battle of Yavin and the destruction of the Death Star. The Galactic Empire was ready to strike back against the Rebel base of Yavin 4, while the Rebel Alliance was readying to move to another system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Apart from the given time of the beginning, the game was not story driven and the scenario expanded freely. Events of the later movies are mentioned and can happen randomly (like the capture of Han Solo by bounty hunters or the Jedi training of Luke Skywalker)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some characters were Force sensitive and could be trained by Jedi characters (like Skywalker or Vader) to augment their abilities. This would lead to a powerful team that could turn many missions successful, improve the morale of planets and fleets they were in, etc."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Opening crawl"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Objectives"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The standard objective of each game was to take the headquarters of the enemy (Coruscant or the mobile Rebel base) and capture the two leaders of the opposite side: The Alliance had to capture Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine, and the Empire's objectives were to capture Luke Skywalker and Mon Mothma."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another mode was also available where you only had to find and destroy the enemy's headquarters."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Canonicity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The game is non-linear and open-ended (the player is able to do anything in any order, according to his or her own preference and skill); therefore, the player could change or avert some events of the canonical timeline, like not migrating to Hoth after Yavin, creating more than one Death Star, killing off important characters like Chewbacca or Lando Calrissian and even leading the Empire to victory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There were, however, some inconsistencies to the canon, like having to \"discover\" planets and \"recruit\" characters who, according to the timeline, were already known. Gameplay values are also radically changed; many spacecraft have shield values different from their canonical values. The Interdictor cruiser, for example, has twice the shield power of the Imperial-class and the Super Star Destroyer is \"merely\" four times as strong as the Imperial-class."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The game contains a large number of misspelled location and character names (such as Farrfin sector spelled as \"Farfin\"). Some bloopers also are present, such as the identity of Bob Hudsol (switched with Vanden Willard) and inaccurate encyclopedia entries, such as the one on the Dark troopers (suggesting they are Force-sensitive stormtroopers). Also, more noticeably, some planets are shown in the wrong sectors. As such, cartographic placements are treated as canon in this article unless they contradict already established locations, in which case the original placement supersedes the Rebellion placement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An additional aspect is the random way that Force-sensitivity is determined. Characters that have no known Force abilities outside of this game, such as Chewbacca or Piett, can randomly be generated as Force-sensitive at the start of a new game and trained up to Jedi Master level."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Side strengths and weaknesses"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Both the Rebels and the Empire have their own strengths and weaknesses, which affect how a player should use them."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rebels"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The primary strength for the Rebels is that, like in the movies, the Empire has to look for their headquarters, and the Rebels can move it to another location. The Rebels start with a larger number of diplomatic, recruiting, and combat characters than the Empire does, so they can start off with missions to move planets to their side or recruiting characters more quickly and at a higher rate than the Empire. The Rebels' main weakness is that, like in the movies, they are outgunned. It isn't until later in the game that they can get ships that can match what the Empire can build, but they compensate somewhat by having much better fighters than Empire for most of the game. Also, the Rebels are unable to do Assassination Missions, since the Rebels belong to the \"Good side\"."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Fleet outguns the Rebellion for most of the game. Part of this is because the Empire starts with the ability to construct Star Destroyers, which the Rebels starships can't compete against for most of the game. The Empire also starts off with a larger number of skilled generals and admirals (who receive an additional 50% bonus to their Leadership Skill if the Emperor resides on Coruscant), giving it an edge in battles, and they can research better ships, and troop types more quickly. The Empire's weakness is that, unlike the Rebels, they can't move their headquarters. It's always located on Coruscant and will be the constant target for the Rebels from the game's start. The Empire also doesn't start off with as many recruiting or diplomatic characters as the Rebels do. Also, although the Empire's starships are better for most of the game, their starting fighters are extremely weak."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Encyclopedia"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Every element of the game had its own encyclopedia-like 'card' with a short description and abilities sheet. This amounted to a total of several hundred encyclopedia cards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Unit management"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There were several kinds of buildable units. Each kind could be constructed by one of three construction facilities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As research progressed, new units and facilities became available for construction. Research could be sped up significantly by ordering characters with the corresponding ability to conduct design missions. Characters could also have the ability to research facilities, starships or troop designs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime during the game a planet could be hit with a Natural Disaster that would destroy resources and energy on the planet, making it worthless. At the same time, new resources can pop up on a planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characters"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There were two kinds of characters in the game: major and minor ones.\nMajor characters were always available at the beginning of the game, while most minor ones had to be recruited. Only major characters could embark on recruitment missions and could not be killed in the line of duty but could be injured, removing them from play for a while."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Minor characters could sometimes be generated Force-sensitive and could be trained by Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader, to augment their abilities. The main characters with Force control could also enhance their abilities by conducting missions. Characters with higher Force ratings had better abilities in diplomacy, espionage, and combat, and could therefore perform missions with a higher chance of success. Force sensitivity could be a two-edged sword however, as Force-sensitive characters stationed in a system could detect the presence of enemy Force-sensitives trying to perform a mission there, and foil the mission automatically. Princess Leia could become Force-sensitive, but only if Luke Skywalker learns of his heritage (i.e. if he meets Darth Vader in combat and is not captured) and the two meet on a planet or ship somewhere in the galaxy where he reveals that she is his twin sister."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some characters could be given military ranks by the player to put them in specific roles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some characters can betray your side to the enemy if the winning conditions favor the other side. Traitors can only be detected by Force-sensitive characters, and the only ways to remove a traitor are to either improve your winning conditions or retire the character, where retiring means the character is out of the game entirely."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "List of characters"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Starships"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The list shows the entire fleet of ships and starfighters for both sides.

Some loathed it, reacting with heavy criticism, considering it one of the most low-quality products of LucasArts, a failed attempt to bring Star Wars into strategy. Others praised the value of game mechanics over graphics, and considered it a high-water mark before the proliferation of games connected to The Phantom Menace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Its orientation towards broad strategy and relatively slow play turned off players who looked forward to greater control over battles. The only action of the game was focused on space battles above planets that were realized through poor graphics, difficult controls, and a lack of interesting options. Indeed, one of the factors most criticized was the complex interface, which discouraged players at first. Despite this, some players embraced the alternative gameplay for its challenges and enjoyed the contrast Rebellion offered against the deluge of real-time strategy games released around the same time."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Modifications"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the main problems of Rebellion, and surely one of the reasons for its lack of success, was its rather limited gameplay.\nThis problem was solved when a player named Revolution released his Rebellion Editor (or RebEd). This program allowed the player to easily edit many aspects of the game, from ship power to in-game interface.\nThese modifications could be saved as \"cards,\" which could then be loaded by any other person who had the Editor. Thanks to this, a solid community has been growing, which offered over a thousand cards to download freely."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The last RebEd version to ever be released was 0.26. There had been speculation and suggestion about Revolution having written a 0.27 version; since this version was never found, this was believed to be untrue.\nThe release of the Editor had also allowed the game to gain popularity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
