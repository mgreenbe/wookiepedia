They were suitable to be used as the primary power source in lightsabers. The first lightsaber Obi-Wan Kenobi wielded as a Jedi used one, which was surrounded by the notched hand grip. Darth Vader's lightsaber used a high-output diatium power cell. Vader's grandson, Ben Solo, also used a lightsaber with a bronze colored diatium power cell cradled in its handle during his training with Luke Skywalker's reborn Jedi Order and after his fall to the dark side as Kylo Ren. Other than lightsabers, the power cell can be used in other weaponry, such as Jannah's bow."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
