It was also rumored she was once owned by Sennex slavers. She was brought to the Jedi Order as a candidate for Jedi training. In an attempt to control the young woman's overtly aggressive instincts, the Council assigned her to the Dark Woman, a mysterious and secretive Jedi Master with a track record of training difficult apprentices. However, the two did not get along well and Sing never progressed past the stage of Padawan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around the age of nine, she was kidnapped by Sennex pirates on Ord Namurt, who played on her deep-seated fears of abandonment and betrayal to shake her trust in the Jedi. They raised the conflicted young woman as a fellow pirate. Tragedy struck again when she was eventually captured by the Hutt crime lord Wallanooga, who in turn lent her to a group of Anzati assassins. The Anzati trained her to be a remorseless killer, even equipping Sing with a bio-computer that fed her additional sensory data.

They would formally meet a decade later."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the deaths of Peerce, J'Mikel and a group of Republic Peace Officers, J'Mikel's Padawan Xiaan Amersu described the attack to the Council. The Council then decided to send Ki-Adi-Mundi, Adi Gallia, and A'Sharad Hett to begin a hunt for Sing. Sing was soon brought to the planet Talas where she was attacked by droidekas dispatched by two Quarrens named Tallet and Lekket. The Quarrens explained to Sing that they needed her services to assassinate the Quarren Senator Tikkes, who had tipped off the Republic on an operation the Quarrens had been running. Sing took no interest in the senator but agreed to the mission anyway after finding out that her former master, the Dark Woman, led the raid. Sing was nearly captured by the Jedi hunting her, but escaped aboard a personal flier. After crashing on a lush jungle world, Sing engaged the Jedi protecting Tikkes. Sing managed to get aboard the ship holding the Senator with only Hett guarding him. Sing and Hett dueled with their lightsabers with Hett coming out as the victor.

She first posed as one of the locals, and asked the young Jedi's help in eliminating a womp rat nest that was harassing the inhabitants. To her surprise, Skywalker managed to solve the problem without any incident. She revealed herself, and temporarily distracted him, by setting off a thermal detonator. Skywalker chased after the Dark Jedi and cornered her near Jabba the Hutt's palace.

He shot poison gas into his main chamber, but Sing escaped, to find herself surrounded by Nikto assassins being led by a Chadra-Fan with a nail gun. After finding another way to escape, she sniped out three Duros assassins, who were also trying to snipe her.

Boba, under the name of \"Lucky\", boarded the Endurance as a clone cadet. After his first attempt on Windu's life failed, he contacted Sing to ask for advice. Sing told him to blow up the reactors, much to Boba's surprise. After Boba successfully destroyed the Endurance's reactors, sending it crashing towards Vanqor, he got into one of the escape pods along with several of the other cadets. Once they were away from the plummeting vessel, the pod was docked by Slave I. Bossk and Sing entered the pod to confront Boba. After telling him that the other cadets must be launched into space, due to the fact that they are \"living witnesses\", Boba reluctantly came aboard Slave I and jettisoned the pod from Slave I's docking area. Although the group of bounty hunters escaped, the cadets were saved by Anakin Skywalker and Windu, who had escaped the Endurance in their Jedi Starfighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She later abducted Admiral Kilian, Commander Ponds, and a naval officer from the crash site of the Endurance on Vanqor. After Skywalker and Windu triggered their bomb in the crash site, Boba convinced Sing to go back there and get the two Jedis' heads to bring to Dooku, who might pay them for their trouble. Sing, along with Boba and Castas, went to the crash site. Due to the ship falling apart, and R2-D2's interference, Sing decided to blow up the crash site. As they left, Bossk contacted Sing, telling that a explosion happened near where the Jedi landed. Sing then ordered Bossk to jam all transmissions from the planet. When Sing and her team returned to Slave I, they saw Windu's Jedi starfighter taking off. Unbeknownst to Sing, only R2-D2 was aboard. Though Slave I took out the Jedi fighter's communications, Artoo reached the hyperspace rings and escaped. Knowing that Windu would not hold a grudge against them, she decided to motivate Windu by using the hostages."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When contacting Mace Windu to come and find her, Sing shot Ponds, whom she had abducted, after Boba wouldn't do it. The group of bounty hunters then docked on Florrum for a visit with Sing's old flame Hondo Ohnaka to see if he would give them any advice. During a visit in the bar with Hondo, Sing overheard Castas communicating via hologram to a friend on Coruscant. After hearing him calling her an old hag, she shot him. Plo Koon and Ahsoka Tano later caught up with her. After having a quarrel in a room, Sing fled away, leaving a discouraged Boba behind. Tano chased her, but after getting an order from Plo Koon, she went to free the hostages. Sing got suspicious, so she went to go and stop the Padawan. After Tano pursued her, she fled on Slave I, but because of a wing failure caused by Tano, the ship crashed. Sing was presumed dead by the Jedi.

She tracked the Senator to Alderaan, where Amidala was due for a conference on refugee concerns.

Only the timely intervention of Tano gave Amidala a flesh wound, forcing Sing to flee."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sing later made a second attempt on Amidala's life when she tracked down the Senator, not being fooled by the BD-3000 luxury droid acting in her place.

To see how \"solitary types\" like Aurra Sing, Robonino and Shahan Alama would work together, Bane set them on a test mission to capture bounty hunter Davtokk on the planet Keyorin. Davtokk attempted to take out Bane to collect the bounty on his head, but was overcome with relative ease by Bane's team.

Eventually, with the help of Robonino they managed to render Skywalker unconscious. When the Hutt crime lord was freed, Aurra Sing successfully left the crime scene along with the rest of the group.

To find out, she entered Jabba's demolition games on her ancient swoop, using her sniper rifle to take out targets. She eventually discovered that that her target was the young Wade Vox, whom she tried to take out after he won his freedom.

She possessed a great hatred of Jedi, believing that they had abandoned her. Because of this she was an angry and pained individual and Aayla Secura took advantage of this by taunting her about being abandoned by the Jedi Order, allowing her to defeat Sing. Sing had no qualms about committing murder and killed Clone Commander Ponds without a second thought. During her youth, she was also noted for being very aggressive, and therefore the Jedi Council placed her under the instruction of An'ya Kuro. However, Sing hated Kuro, possibly because she used brutal and, to some, disturbing training methods, and she quickly believed that the Jedi Master had abandoned her when she was captured by pirates and thus turned to the dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, despite her ruthlessness, Sing was also somewhat of a mother to Boba Fett during his teenage years, sometimes addressing him as \"honey\" and stopping him from drinking alcohol in Hondo Ohnaka's bar.

No one had, by 23 BBY, ever gained Jango's entire trust, and very few\u2014only Zam Wesell and Cradossk\u2014had ever earned his respect. But ever since his first run-in with Sing, he'd felt something for her that was\u2014for Jango\u2014even more powerful than trust or respect: she had his sympathy, something Fett kept in extremely short supply. While others looked at Aurra and saw nothing more than a trigger-happy psychopath, Jango saw her as a broken spirit, the result of a lifetime of bad breaks.
