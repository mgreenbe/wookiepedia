The cousin was too small to contribute towards the defense of the family, which left Phasma and her brother Keldo needing to rise to the occasion to defend the family. At some point before Phasma and Keldo joined the Scyre clan, the Dug Balder captured the cousin for the rival Claw clan during a raid. The cousins capture was eventually recounted by Scyre member Siv to Resistance spy Vi Moradi when the latter traveled to Parnassos seeking information on Phasma. Moradi later revealed the past of Phasma to Captain Cardinal, a rival of Phasma within the First Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
