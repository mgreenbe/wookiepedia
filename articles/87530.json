The end of the bridge pointed toward the site's dominating structure, the Great Temple, and ended in a reflecting pool. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, the viaduct still existed, although some of its spans had collapsed. The Alliance to Restore the Republic, which had settled its headquarters in the Great Temple, had also installed a small command post under the viaduct. During the Blockade of Yavin in 0 ABY, the 501st Legion of the Galactic Empire attacked the Massassi Site in retaliation for the destruction of the first Death Star by the Alliance a few months earlier. During the strike, the Imperials secured the viaduct, the pool and a nearby water fountain."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
