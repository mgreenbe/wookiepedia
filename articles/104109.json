That 17-level, octogonal complex was devoted to Lorrdian theatrical arts. Each level included several theaters and performing areas, faced an open-air courtyard, and featured a facade representing a type of Lorrdian architecture. It took its name from an ancient gathering place in New Shallos that had been destroyed by the Argazdans. Although actors performed mainly in the theaters, those who had not booked often played in the many courtyards. The Performance Square was considered a good place to discover the next rising stars, which prompted many agents and talent scouts from Adarlon, Per Lupelo, or even Coruscant to attend the shows it hosted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
