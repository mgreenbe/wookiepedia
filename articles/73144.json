Around the time of the end of the Clone Wars, on the planet Cularin, the Human Sal, the Rodian Renna and the Wookiee Ooorlak shared a kaavo that had been prepared by the chef Val-Aruun. Soon there was only one slice left and in order to decide who would get to eat it, the trio decided to each tell a story about the death of a loved one and to give the slice of kaavo to the person who told their story best.
