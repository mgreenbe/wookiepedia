In 34 ABY, the Shipboard Tracking Control Complex on board the Supremacy was able to track the fleet of the Resistance, using it to ambush the rag-tag fleet. The tracker was eventually disabled when members of the Resistance, Finn, Rose Tico, and BB-8, along with a hired slicer, DJ, were able to board the Supremacy and disable the tracker. By the end of the engagement, the Supremacy was destroyed when the Resistance flagship, the Raddus, rammed into it when it entered hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
