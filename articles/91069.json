Duja reported that Separatists were on Mokivj and had a droid factory in place. Padme would go on to investigate, but her husband, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker would go in to find out what went wrong. Anakin would later meet a mysterious ship underneath the command of Chiss Senior Captain Mitth'raw'nuruodo, also known by his core name of \"Thrawn.\" When Thrawn met Skywalker, he introduced himself as a commander instead of a Senior Captain. His pilot, the Sky-walker Che'ri, reasoned that using the lower rank was less intimidating."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
