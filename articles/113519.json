During the Age of the Empire, the Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant used Reitgen Hoops to train Imperial cadets how to fly. During one of Thane Kyrell and Ciena Ree's training exercises, ten of these hoops were positioned in different places around the Academy from group level up to the Sky Loop. The cadets had to fly through these hoops with the winner receiving fifty points. Thane and Ciena's bikes got entangled but the two still managed to win the race, sharing the prize among themselves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
