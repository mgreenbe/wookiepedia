Although it lacked key exports, Inusagi benefited through its proximity to wealthy planets, such as Naboo, the homeworld of Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine. For centuries, Inusagi was a neutral planet, but by the year 6 BBY, it became allied with the Galactic Empire after the chieftess of Inusagi was pressured into signing a treaty. Shortly after, the Empire used Inusagi's traditional sakoola blossom festival to announce a new planetary leader, Governor Cor Tophervin, a personal friend of the Emperor. However, given Inusagi's relation to Naboo, the anti-Imperial Arane Oreida saw the party as an opportunity to send a message to the Empire, and she hired Saw Gerrera to infiltrate the festival. With invitations forged by Jyn Erso, Gerrera and a group of Arane's partisans entered the festival in the chieftess's palace, and they massacred the guests, both Inusagian and Imperial."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Inusagi appears in Beth Revis' 2017 canon novel Rebel Rising.
