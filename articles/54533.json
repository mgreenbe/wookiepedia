The ship was guarded by a full battalion of Knights of Zakuul and Skytroopers and had a vault so strong, it could survive the rest of the ship being reduced to atoms. The ship would spend most of its time hiding deep in the atmosphere of gas giant Vandin, only coming up annually for air.

Dretcher's part included forging the identity of High Justice Vaylin for her mother Senya, who provided a genetic match and required character knowledge. Dretcher's holographic disguise worked, allowing Senya to get on board under the identity of Vaylin, with SCORPIO posing as her attache droid. From the bridge, SCORPIO opened the way to the vault for Gault and the Alliance Commander, while Vette disabled the vault's security mechanisms. While inside the vault, Gault planted a missile warhead inside the vault, which upon detonation vaporized its entire content of precious metals, while leaving everything outside the vault intact. The vault's entire content of precious metals, which was then pumped into a tanker piloted by Lana Beniko and Theron Shan, while the rest of the team made their getaway. At the same time, Vaylin herself arrived on board, but the team managed to avoid her by going on the exterior of the ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Gilded Star appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire Chapter 13: Profit and Plunder."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
