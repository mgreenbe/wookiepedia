Four years after the Empire's formation, Borkas held the rank of major and was working as the commanding officer of Ryloth's Equatorial Communications Hub. During an attempt by the rebellious Free Ryloth Movement to assassinate Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine and the Sith Lord Darth Vader, Borkas's communication hub was attacked by movement members in order to disable communications across Ryloth. The attack was successful, and Borkas immediately ordered his men to begin repairs. Moff Delian Mors then arrived at the station and requisitioned Borkas and some of his men to help her find the Emperor and Vader, who had crashed somewhere in the nearby wilderness. They eventually found the pair and helped them in fighting off Free Ryloth movement members who had hunted them down, also making sure the traitorous Imperial Colonel Belkor Dray was killed during the fighting."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
