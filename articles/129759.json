The transport was present at the rebel outpost on the jungle planet Lowik. The rebel forces on Lowik, led by Lieutenant Kondra, were forced to evacuate, and the transport was commanded by Commander Hill Purpura in the escape. The Spirit of Jedha was sabotaged by Purpura, who intended to betray the Rebellion by selling the transponder codes of the rebel armada to the Empire, having lost faith in the cause after its defeat at the Battle of Hoth. As the result of the sabotage of its hyperdrive motivator, the Spirit of Jedha dropped out of hyperspace while in transit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The transport was left stranded at Terminus, the intersection between the Corellian Trade Spine and Hydian Way hyperspace routes, where it and its two X-wing starfighters came under attack from the Ohnaka Gang pirates. Kondra was unable to return for the transport or call for assistance from Rebel Command as the Rebellion's security codes had been broken by the Empire. As such, Kondra tasked the bounty hunter Beilert Valance, who owed him a favor, with rescuing the Spirit of Jedha. Valance traveled to Terminus in his starship, the Broken Wing, and attempted to contact the transport, whose crew, consisting of fifteen rebels at the time of his arrival, warned him to flee. The vessels of the Ohnaka Gang, commanded by Captain Skragg, subsequently fired upon the Broken Wing. Valance was forced to eject the central module of the Broken Wing and land in the Spirit of Jedha's hangar, where he was apprehended and imprisoned by Commander Purpura, who claimed Valance could be working with the pirates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mechanic Blanch Sproull freed Valance, who utilized the transport's sole remaining X-wing starfighter, ordering the astromech droid Tee-Six to send a message for him while he exited the starfighter, grabbing onto the outer hull of the Spirit of Jedha. As the pirates brought their Corona-class armed frigate alongside the Spirit of Jedha, preparing to board the vessel, Commander Purpura held his blaster to the back of the other rebel crewmember on the transport's bridge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
