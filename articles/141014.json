In c. 31 BBY, Tebari was present in the Underground cantina on the moon Tilnes when collapses in the world's crystal mines resulted in the cantina's ceiling falling in, destroying the building. Tebari subsequently accompanied the Heroes of Cularin, the Wookiee Ulucca and the Humans Nia Reston, San Herrera and Philinda on an expedition into the crystal mines, to search for any people who had been trapped in the tunnels by the collapses."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
