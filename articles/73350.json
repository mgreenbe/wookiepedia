Interrogated by Republic Intelligence, he insisted that the entire Kaikielius campaign was a training exercise and believed that commando droids disguised in clone trooper armor had replaced his squad. Owing to this incident he was dubbed \"the Mad Clone of Kaikielius\" by HoloNet commentators."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
