After Danak failed to return from a scouting mission to the factory, Surro led the team to scout Imperial camps for his location, but they arrived too late and Danak was executed by Imperial Captain Bowenn right in front of them. Surro then led the team to follow a local Imperial sympathizer Ivo, who turned Danak to the Empire in the first place.

Theron Shan and Sith Intelligence Minister Lana Beniko uncovered that Vitiate's mind control over his subjects was broken by electrocution and arranged for Surro and other puppets to be shocked en masse in the city of New Adasta. Vitiate claimed that Surro's body was his favorite so far and engaged Shan's ally in combat, but was defeated and Surro regained control on her body in time to be taken away from Ziost by Shan and Beniko."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After being taken offworld, Master Surro succumbed to her wounds and became one with the Force.
