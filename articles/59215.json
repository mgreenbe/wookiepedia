Solo frequently stopped over at the apartment along with his partner Chewbacca whilst visiting Nar Shaddaa, though after Solo embarked on a relationship with the mechanic Salla Zend, he often stayed at Zend's residence instead, and he allowed his associate Jarik Solo to stay at the apartment in his absence, to keep Chewbacca company. After Solo won the housekeeping droid ZZ-4Z from the smuggler Mako Spince in a card game, Solo tasked the droid with maintaining his apartment, though he soon found the droid to be a nuisance that hindered his efforts to keep the apartment tidy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Solo later joined the Rebel Alliance and left his career as a smuggler, and he abandoned his apartment for several years. In his absence, ZZ-4Z failed to keep the apartment clean. During 10 ABY, Solo ventured back to the apartment accompanied by his wife Leia, hoping to pick up some power couplings that he had kept stashed there. However, Mako Spince betrayed his former friend by informing the bounty hunters Boba Fett and Dengar\u2014who hoped to collect a bounty that had been placed on Solo's head by the Hutts\u2014that Solo was on Nar Shaddaa, and Spince and the two hunters subsequently staked out the apartment, waiting for Solo to arrive. When Solo and his spouse entered the apartment, a firefight quickly broke out between the Solos and the bounty hunters. ZZ-4Z was destroyed in the crossfire and the Solos then fled out onto the streets of Nar Shaddaa, with Dengar and Fett in hot pursuit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
