Many gladiators died fighting in the arena, which included a huge statue of the Tionese Despot Xim holding a heatbeam which towered over the fighting area. The statue was made of polysteel and made in a factory on the planet Centares during the chancellorship of Kirbat the Unready. The Historian Bleys Harand mentioned the arena and the statue in his text Travels Amid Strange Stars, in which he dismissed the statue as an inaccurate depiction of Xim."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The arena was first mentioned in 2013 in the third instalment of Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare Author's Cut, a series of posts on the StarWars.com blog featuring material cut from The Essential Guide to Warfare.
