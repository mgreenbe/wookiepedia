His name literally translated as 'slithering smasher', although he was also known as 'Beater'. He was part of a symbiotic pair known as 'Biter and Beater' with the other being, Sgauru."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tu-Scart was the only one of his kind. The 'Serpentine Crusher' resembled a massive elongated Hutt and was covered in glossy black scales. His skin was sleek and moist, interrupted only by the bony ridge that ran the length of his spine and served as an anchor point for the chitinous Sgauru. Two black eyes were set in the sides of his bony skull and a pair of non-venomous fangs protruded from his jaws."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although calm in the presence of the biotechnology of the Yuuzhan Vong, the 'Serpentine Crusher' became vicious when exposed to the technology of the galaxy. When deployed onto planetary surfaces, 8 handlers were often required to herd the Tu-Scart off the landing craft, at which point he would begin his rampage. The Beater used the olfactory glands located in his tongue to locate the largest concentrations of enemy targets and instinctually headed in that direction, all the while communicating with Sgauru through a form of mental telepathy similar to that of the villips. When assaulting a building, Tu-Scart used his bony head as a battering ram, although he preferred to loop his coils around the structure and crush it to the point of collapse."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tu-Scart and Sgauru were created by a group of Master Shapers 50 standard years before the Yuuzhan Vong War. Tu-Scart was the 'Beater' while Sgauru was the 'Biter'. According to legend Yun-Yammka, the Slayer, blessed the Master Shapers with the knowledge necessary to create such creatures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Slayer ordered the creation of the pair for the use of destroying the monolithic duracrete structures in use by the galaxy and to allow the Warrior caste to attend to more \"honorable duties.\" Due to the 'divine nature' of their conception, Tu-Scart and Sgauru were respected by the Yuuzhan Vong military."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "'Beater and Biter' were first deployed against the New Republic during the Evacuation of Rychel in 25 ABY, and later during the Battle of Duro in 26 ABY. During the battles, Tu-Scart was deployed to smash buildings, also at Rychel, it was used to project fear into the minds of the New Republic troops. Later, New Republic scientists and psychologists involved with the Eclipse Project came to believe that the 'Pair' may have been only deployed for only the most important battles at the command of the Warmaster, Tsavong Lah."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar in 29 ABY, Jedi Knight Jacen Solo faced the 'Biter' and the 'Beater'. However, he used the Force to persuade the World Brain which controlled them to turn on its Yuuzhan Vong masters. Since the World Brain controlled all the Yuuzhan Vong war beasts present at the battle including the 'pair', it used Sgauru to transport Jacen to Shimrra's Citadel, where the Yuuzhan Vong command was located."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, this action angered the surrounding Chazrach slaves whom began pelting both warbeasts with razor and thud bugs, and firejelly grenades. Luckily for the 'Beater and Biter', help arrived when the rakamats turned on the Chazrach.
