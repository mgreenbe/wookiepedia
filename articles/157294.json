He soon encountered a Rebel. The two fought for 45 minutes before they agreed on a truce, though they hardly got along in any friendly capacity. The scout trooper threatened to bring the Rebel trooper in as his prisoner, only when he attempted to subdue the Rebel, he brought not only the Rebel, but himself into a trap created by the native Ewoks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ewoks eventually came back to their trap, tying the scout trooper to a log and giving the Rebel trooper food nourishment. The scout trooper demanded that the Rebel trooper talk the Ewoks into releasing him upon return to their village.

Resigned to being stuck on Endor forever, the scout trooper nearly gave up. The Rebel trooper, however, spotted a left over AT-ST. While the pair checked the leftover vehicle's power cells, a Gorax attacked the Ewoks that had been leading them. The Rebel trooper used the walker's cannons to kill the beast, much to the chagrin of the scout trooper, who wanted to keep the energy in the power cells. During their argument about the \"circle of life\", the Rebel trooper spotted a huge structure on the radar, about the size of a small city and transmitting an Imperial code."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Getting Off Endor"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When they arrived at the location of the signal, they discovered that it wasn't a city, but rather an Imperial Star Destroyer that had plummeted to the moon during the battle.

He also discovered that the signal was an automatic evacuation signal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next morning, the freighter arrived.
