There, Kenit served well, though he reported the political errors of some of his superiors, which led to him being promoted and transferred away from the base."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thomquizzar Naval Base was first mentioned in 1998's The Far Orbit Project, by Timothy S. O'Brien. The Far Orbit Project was a supplement to West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game and had the same theme of the previous publication, Pirates & Privateers, as it followed the privateering vessel Far Orbit. In The Far Orbit Project, the base's name is written as Thomquizarr Naval Base. However, The Essential Atlas, published in 2009, named the system that the base was at as Thomquizzar. This article assumes the Atlas is right, as it is the newer of the two books."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
