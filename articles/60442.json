It had a top speed of one hundred and thirty kilometers an hour, and a ground clearance of two meters. Heavy Trackers were equipped with an omniprobe sensor array, a standard military-grade sensor array, and integrated long-range comlink to detect enemy forces and then relay that information to front line combat units. The omniprobe conducted low-level scans tied to a planet's gravitational center, with the sensor beam following the terrain which allowed it to detect enemy units without requiring line-of-sight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Heavy Tracker was a heavily armored craft armed with a single Mk 2e/W heavy laser cannon The cannon was fed data acquired by the omniprobe, allowing it to fire at selected targets from long range. A crew of six operated the craft, two of whom were the gunners assigned to man the heavy laser cannon, although it could be run by a crew of three individuals if needed. Five additional crew operated the omniprobe; two communications technicians, two sensor technicians, and the commander. It could carry two hundred and fifty kilograms of cargo, and consumables to last a week. Heavy Trackers cost 125,000 credits to buy new, and 75,000 used."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Alliance to Restore the Republic classified the Heavy Tracker as a Combat Assault Vehicle, but utilized them as mobile scanning units rather than direct assault craft. Due to the vehicle's large target profile, slow speed, and long-range targeting capabilities, Heavy Trackers were kept behind the front lines since they had no reason to enter close combat situations. They were also employed as mobile command units.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
