Specialized for in-atmosphere missions, the atmospheric fighter was identifiable by its horizontal high-speed wings and large central pod. Largely because of its specialization for such missions, it was one of the few TIE models to be used by the Imperial Army as well as the Imperial Navy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE/sk x1 experimental air superiority fighter featured flat, pointed wings specially designed for in-atmosphere combat. Thus, it was faster than the standard TIE/ln space superiority starfighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the striker's wings were unusually shaped; straying from the typical TIE fighter's wing shapes, the TIE/sk's wings helped increase the ship's VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) capacity. The craft was able to gain additional speed by curling down its wings, engaging from flight mode to attack mode."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fighter was heavily armed, sporting four pairs of laser barrels and proton bombs that were particularly effective against vehicle units, dealing heavy damage over a large area. The TIE variant was equipped with ArmaTek's VL-61/79 proton bombs, which were deployed from a proton bomb chute fitted upon the armored hull of the craft's underside."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although its intended role was as an atmospheric fighter, it could also be used as a starfighter to some extent, and accompany standard TIE fighters. However, the attributes that made the striker a useful atmospheric fighter made it less than ideal in space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE striker could be further modified with lightweight frames, thus allowing for an increased speed.

In particular, because of the secrecy behind the Imperial security complex on the jungle planet Scarif requiring a vigilant and swift defense force, the TIE pilots stationed there utilized the fighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE strikers notably defended Scarif during a Rebel attack that was part of the Rebel mission to steal the plans to the Death Star.
