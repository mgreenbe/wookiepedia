The Hoskas gathered in herds of several thousand and migrated and stampeded across the plains, eating and trampling everything in their path."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and Appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hoskas were huge, hoofed quadrapeds standing nearly three meters at the shoulder and capable of running at speeds of up to 15 kilometers per hour. They were predominantly black, but combinations of brown, tan, yellow, pale red and even white could be found among the hoska population. Each of these huge creatures had a set sharp horns which were used to spear anything that got in their way."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hoskas weren't very intelligent, and would not avoid hazards or dangers, so even if several dozen members of a herd were killed, the survivors would mindlessly continue on. They were also easily frightened: as soon as one creature had been spooked and began running away, the rest of the herd followed. Lightning, meteorite impacts, the scent of terecons and a blaster shot were all known to cause stampedes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
