There, Jorgatha attended a meeting led by Sergeant Carver to determine a plan of action for their group of personnel. After the group travelled to the Scar of Troithe, a continent on the planet, Jorgatha was part of another meeting held by Carver, where he and sergeant drew out plans on an attack on the 204th at the Core Nine mining megafacility, debating whether a frontal assault was valid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, Jorgatha and his sister Gorgeous Su served as soldiers in the 61st Mobile Infantry, a company in the New Republic's army. Around 5 ABY, the 61st participated in a campaign in the Cerberon system as a part of General Hera Syndulla's battle group. During the campaign, the battle group's fleet above the planet Troithe was devastated by the Galactic Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing, which then forced the 61st squads from their positions on the planet. Jorgatha rendezvoused with almost fifty more 61st personnel and around twenty local insurgents in a speeder garage in the Highgarden District, a lightly urbanized district on Troithe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the 61st's captain, Hazram Namir, and half of the company stranded off-world, Sergeant Carver called a meeting with Jorgatha and the other senior members of the 61st's personnel at the garage, as well as two New Republic pilots, to discuss their situation. There, the sergeant assumed leadership of the group at the garage, despite protests, and the attendees debated what they should do. After Carver suggested that Imperial reinforcements may arrive if the New Republic personnel wait to long, Jorgatha, who took up one of the rooms corners, shifted himself and attempted to speak before being interrupted by the elderly human Junior."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the meeting, the New Republic group, Jorgatha among them, traveled from the Highgarden District to the Scar of Troithe, a heavily mined continent on the planet.

During the meeting, Jorgatha and Carver sketched their own plans to assault Core Nine in the dust of the ravine they were sat at. The pair further debated whether a frontal attack on the facility was too late. After the 204th's forces began diverting towards Core Nine, the New Republic group launched an attack on the facility, with the 204th fleeing Troithe in the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jorgatha was a male Houk who was large with a big jaw.
