Its armament consisted of two primary mega-ion cannons\u2014which were designed to disable entire squadrons of starfighters and sub-capital ships\u2014along with hundreds of turbolasers, ion cannons, flak cannons, and other assorted weaponry. These vessels were operated by a crew of 23,350 officers, droids, and other enlisted crew, while also carrying tens of thousands of battle droids, as well as Vulture-class droid starfighters, Hyena-class Droid Bombers, several landing craft, ground combat vehicles, shuttles, and utility vehicles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Malevolence was one of two examples of a Subjugator-class model that was used as the flagship of the Kaleesh Separatist General Grievous and the initial testbed for the mega-ion cannon early in the Clone Wars. After a series of strikes on Galactic Republic fleets that left no survivors, the Malevolence was tracked to the Abregado system by Jedi Master Plo Koon, whose fleet was destroyed in the subsequent battle, but Koon and several clone troopers managed to survive the attack and report their findings to the Republic. Sometime later, the warship attempted to destroy the Republic's secret Outer Rim medical station, but was stopped by a small strike force led by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, which resulted in the destruction of the ion cannon and forced the Malevolence to retreat.

Built around a pair of massive mega-ion cannons, the Subjugator-class heavy cruiser maintained a bulky, split-level prow suggestive of a mouthful of ragged teeth, as a well as a narrow stern that tapered to the ship's propulsion array.
