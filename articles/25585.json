Eventually the academy closed and was only remembered in the modern era by the scant records that remained in the Archives of the Jedi Temple or the personal collections of some Dark Lords of the Sith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the rough draft for the original movie Leia leaves the Palace of Lite to study at the Academy, which is located in a place called Yuell on Aquilae.
