Although largely uninhabited, there was a small tribe of Ortolans who occupied a village within the wastes. The Plains were also stalked by a terentatek and were scattered with large statutes and ancient ruins. During the Great Galactic War, the Ash Plains were visited by the Sith apprentices Exal Kressh and Teneb Kel, as well as the Jedi Master Jerbhen Hulis.
