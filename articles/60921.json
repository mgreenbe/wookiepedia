Taking a leave of absence from his normal duties, Kame spent a decade on Iktotch working on the Gauntlets. Frustrated that he could not perfect them, he occasionally entertained local village children during his time in isolation. Realizing his application of the Force was the problem, not the Gauntlets, he was able to successfully change his approach and lift a village girl into the air. The gloves were made of the hide and horn of a local ungulate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
