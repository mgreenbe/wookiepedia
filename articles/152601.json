In addition, from the presence of multiple red horizontal floor girders in the ship, there were also plans to narrow down and separate various trenches. Because the cloaking devices were exposed, they were vulnerable targets. However, this was largely compensated with several turbolaser turret batteries surrounding the area to outright remove the chance of an aerial bombardment from starfighters and/or capital ships, as well as mitigate the chances of a starfighter commencing a strafing run to destroy the cloaking devices."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like the Terror, it also possessed three cloaking devices that allowed the ship to become invisible. One was located close to the bow of the ship; the second was located directly below the ship's command tower; and the third was located at the stern of the ship. The cloaking devices, however, were connected to the power generator, which makes them a crippling weakness to the ship should all of them be destroyed, resulting in its destruction, as Rogue Squadron demonstrated during its mission."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Armament"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The vessel was armed with a number of turbolaser towers that provided defense during its construction. Though the tower defenses could not prevent an assault on the exposed cloaking devices, they made the gauntlet very dangerous for attacking Rebel fighters. The turrets could easily target starfighters who flew too high above the Dreadnought's surface. Many of the turbolaser turrets were put on towers that were higher than normal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite Kuat Drive Yards being granted exclusive development rights to any and all Super Star Destroyer-style ships (including the Executor-class Star Dreadnought) after the Executor's completion, the Empire nonetheless somehow managed to grant permission[source?] for Fondor Shipyards (the ones who finished development of the Executor) develop a variant of the Executor-class Star Dreadnought line that was equipped with cloaking technology."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In actuality, the vessel was made as part of a ruse by Emperor Palpatine to give the Rebel Alliance an easy victory that would increase their daring before the climactic Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The shipyard that the prototype was berthed in was surrounded by an extensive network of space stations fitted with deflector shield generators. In 3 ABY, an initial Rebel strike team blasted their way through one of the stations, with an unmanned GR-75 medium transport ramming the dock's primary control center."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having fought their way through the protective shielding system, the Rebel fighters, led by Wedge Antilles, managed to knock out three main cloaking devices on the unfinished Star Dreadnought, which caused it to explode."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Executor-class Star Dreadnought with the cloaking devices appears in the 2003 video game Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
