While not foolproof, the Vibre sported matte-black stealth plating and sensor masks that allowed it to close within firing distance before it was detected."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Vibre's primary armament were four heavy ion cannons, which were turreted to maximize firing arcs. The Vibre depended on these cannons to disable ships too large for it to destroy outright, and was fully capable of disabling or driving away the heavily armed and shielded escort ships that accompanied New Republic convoys."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With its target disabled, the Vibre could use its laser weaponry to precisely target and cripple enemy systems, as well as to blast a hole in a target's hull for boarding.
