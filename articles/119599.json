He worked for the Galactic Empire and was based in a laboratory in the Middle City of the planet Taris. However, the Alliance to Restore the Republic suspected that Narubo was developing dangerous biological agents for the Empire, so they sent a team of agents to Taris, to capture him. The agents gained custody of Narubo and began to transport him to Taris Spaceport, where a YT-1300 light freighter was waiting, to take Narubo off-world. However, they were tailed by Karvas Toll, an Imperial agent who planned to free Narubo from the Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
