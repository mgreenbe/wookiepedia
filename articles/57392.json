During the war, Grimgrim participated in an assault on a secret Imperial base on the planet Vatleria. Although the Wookiee and the rest of the unit overcame the stormtroopers who guarded the outpost, the Rebel Four were plunged into subterranean traps by Darth Vader, an Imperial-allied Sith Lord who was hiding within the ruins.

Grimgrim eventually became a member of an Alliance unit known as the Rebel Four, a quartet in which the Wookiee served alongside F4-MF, Falaem Onn, and Soo Rcharrz."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point before 4 ABY, an informant tipped the Rebel Four off to the location of a hidden Imperial base on the planet Vatleria, a world that had been abandoned by its original population. Under the command of the droid F4-MF, Grimgrim and the others sought out the base to stop whatever Imperial machinations were afoot there. The team eventually discovered stone ruins guarded by Imperial stormtroopers. Confident that the fortress was the base they sought, they sneaked past the guards. Upon F4-MF's command, Grimgrim and the others stormed the base and attacked the last group of stormtroopers there. In the ensuing fray, Grimgrim fought with bare hands, while the other Rebels fired on their enemies with blasters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unbeknownst to Grimgrim and the Rebel Four, Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith, detected the Rebels' assault with the the Force and watched the goings-on from a viewscreen inside the fortress. When Vader sprung a trap for the intruders, ropes ejected from the ground and snagged Grimgrim and the others. The Wookiee was separated from the rest of the Rebel Four and dropped into a pit. There, a barrage of boulders tumbled down upon the warrior. Although the Rebel attempted to deflect the rocks with brute strength, the barrage proved too much, and the Wookiee died. Similar traps killed the rest of the unit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grimgrim was a stocky member of the Wookiee species, with black eyes and a muscular body covered in blond fur.

Grimgrim mirrors the character Ben Grimm, also known as the Thing, who has a rocky body and incredible strength, with the catchphrase of \"It's clobberin' time!\", which Grimgrim mirrors with his own catchphrase of \"It's rebellin' time!\". Similarly, the way in which each member of the Rebel Four dies mirrors the super power of his or her Fantastic Four prototype; in Grimgrim's case, death from boulders reflects Ben Grimm's rocky body."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
