It was worn about the head in a manner similar to a circlet or crown, and was small enough to be concealed by many headdresses. The first known mind-control devices were commissioned by the Baroness Omnino in the years leading up to 37 BBY as part of her plot against the Galactic Republic and the Jedi. They were used by her and her lieutenant, Taxer Sundown."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
