Skywalker was chased by one, until Kenobi knocked it unconscious. The gundark was sealed in a cave by Skywalker's padawan, Ahsoka Tano.

Unfortunately, a pair of gundarks attacked the two astromechs and R8 was torn apart. As the gundarks attempted to do the same to R2, a bomb went off and killed one of the gundarks.
