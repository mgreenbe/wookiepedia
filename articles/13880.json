She successfully led Separatist forces against the Galactic Republic during multiple battles and engagements. However, during the Battle of Sullust, Count Dooku was contacted by his Sith master Darth Sidious. Sidious believed that Ventress had grown too powerful, and believed that she was being trained to be used against him so Dooku could take power, in line with the Sith Rule of Two. While Dooku denied this, Sidious ignored him and ordered Ventress' death. Dooku was forced to agree to kill Ventress. While the battle raged on between the Republic and Confederate fleets, he called off her reinforcements, and ordered the T-series tactical droid TJ-912 to fire on the ship Ventress was on, where she was dueling Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Following this, Dooku informed Ventress by Hologram that she was no longer his apprentice and that she would die."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite Dooku's scheme, Ventress managed to survive and escaped from both the Jedi and the Confederacy.

After taking part in safe cargo objective, she remembered Talzin's final words to her, though now without the same feeling of pain.
