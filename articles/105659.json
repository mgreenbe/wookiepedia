They were used by the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the later stages of the Clone Wars for purpose of disabling enemy craft and were the successor to the Mark One Pistoeka sabotage droid. They were transferred to enemy fighters via specialized discord missiles, and popped open to reveal their insect-looking body. They operated quickly, using their tools of vandalism, such as drilling cutters. While their tools were effective, the central eye was a weak spot which could take the buzz droid out of commission when hit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pistoeka sabotage droids, otherwise known as buzz droids, were disposable weapons produced by Colicoid Creation Nest for the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and were typically deployed via discord missiles from either HMP droid gunships, Vulture-class droid starfighters, or droid tri-fighters, which contained up to seven buzz droids. The sabotage droids utilized a variety of specialized tools such as a circular saw, drill head, pincer arm, and plasma torch, to swiftly dismantle starfighters, vehicles, or even droids. Despite their individual insignificance, a swarm of buzz droids were capable of making short work of a craft by targeting its vital systems. The droid was 0.25 meters in diameter and were equipped with red sensor systems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, buzz droids were used by the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
