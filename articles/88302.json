Her task was to use her Jedi healing techniques in order to assist the medical staff aboard the Rimsoos, the medical facilities tending to wounded clone troopers during the Battle of Drongar. If Barriss is successful in healing the clone troopers, she will return as a Jedi Knight. She makes friends with Republic surgeons Jos Vondar, Tolk le Trene, Klo Merit and Zan Yant, as well as the protocol droid I-5YQ and Republic news reporter Den Dhur. I-Five's purpose on Drongar is to find a way back to Coruscant to find and look after Jax Pavan, a young Jedi apprentice who was the son of I-Five's late business partner, Lorn Pavan. Lorn died twelve years earlier by the Sith known as Darth Maul for being in possession of a Sith Holocron that would have revealed vital details to the Blockade of Naboo that followed shortly after Lorn's death, and plans for the downfall of the Jedi Order. Den Dhur begins to associate himself with CT-914, a clone trooper whose friend had died during the battle. CT-914 would later be killed by a Separatist ambush. Barriss finds an antagonistic enemy in Phow Ji, a Republic-hired mercenary who kills Separatist sentient beings on Drongar not just for money, but for his own sadistic pleasures. Their polarized ideals clash that results in a rivalry between them. And meanwhile, in orbit around Drongar, corrupt Republic Admiral Tarnese Bleyd makes a shady deal with Filba the Hutt so that Bleyd can return to his home planet and can result in the Republic's loss over Drongar. Amid all of this, a spy lurks in the corners, sabotaging the Republic's operations on the planet. Bleyd's deal with Filba is ruined when the Hutt is poisoned and dies. Later, Bleyd is confronted by Kaird the Nedij, a member of the Black Sun crime organization which Bleyd is associated to. Kaird confirms to Bleyd that Black Sun is aware of the Admiral's interests, and Kaird kills Bleyd. Phow Ji sacrifices himself by using a bomb to wipe out an entire platoon of Separatist sentient beings, and he has already recorded this to have sent to Den Dhur as an impressive news report to the Republic. Eventually, the spy, who goes by the alias Column under the leadership of the Separatists and the alias Lens under Black Sun, sabotages the Rimsoo that Barriss and her friends reside in. Though they successfully evacuate to another Rimsoo, Zan Yant is killed, throwing Jos Vondar, Dr. Yant's friend, into a deep grief, even despite finding the comfort of a new girlfriend from Tolk le Trene."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On page 53, the Great Hyperspace War is mistakenly referred to as the Stark Hyperspace Conflict."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This is a gallery of the different cover variations of Medstar I: Battle Surgeons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
