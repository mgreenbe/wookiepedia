While in the Shadowlands, Freyyr became almost feral, to the extent that he would attack anyone he met, even his own friends.

While Freyyr had the warblade during scenes in the Kashyyyk Shadowlands, the warblade was not the sword that Freyyr used later in the game when taking back his position as chieftain from his son, Chuundar. During the coup, Freyyr wielded a single-bladed weapon that was similar to the vibroblades seen in the game. The weapon was first referred to as Freyyr's warblade in the 2004 video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords by Obsidian Entertainment. In The Sith Lords, it was a rare melee weapon that could be found in randomly determined places throughout the game. Due to this fact, the player was not guaranteed to find the weapon each time through the game. Freyyr's warblade was one of the most powerful melee weapons in the game, and it also possessed an increased attack bonus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
