During the Battle of Saleucami, the Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker and Adi Gallia used a microjump to emerge from hyperspace a short distance from Grievous's warship. In 14 BBY, Moff Wilhuff Tarkin ordered the Venator-class Star Destroyer Electrum to conduct a microjump to the rimward edge of Sentinel Base's system. This enabled the Electrum to ambush a group of insurgents led by Berch Teller. A microjump had limitations too; traversal over too short of a distance could cause a ship to overshoot its destination, possibly ending up thousands of kilometers away."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
