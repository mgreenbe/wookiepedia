The base of the spire contained a massive Frangawl Temple deep within the caves under the spire. Originally constructed using local timber hauled up the mountain in a show of strength by the Dagoyan Order, the interior chambers were carved into several stories of the rock of the host spire. Undergoing many expansions led by different monarchs, the Palace was reached from the ground only by undertaking the arduous climb up the rock face of the spire, mirroring the spiritual journey of the Dagoyan tradition. To accommodate offworld dignitaries and representatives, the palace carved a landing pad into the top of the rock spire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
