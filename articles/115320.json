The Teedos manage to expel the TIE fighter cockpit and continue the pursuit. Rey reaches a dead end and the Teedos laugh in glee as they close in on her.

However, Rey uses the platform as a leverage to jump over the vacuum machine to higher ground. She then swings over a rope and purposely drops her jewels over the edge. Teedo and his gang move their vacuum machine forward and capture the jewels, only to fall over the edge. Rey watches the dazed Teedos with her plant while swinging on the rope. Rey soon finds a nursery full of similar plants. She laughs in joy and finds a rope which exposes a compartment full of jewels. Rey climbs out of the pit with her jewels. She laughs as the sun sets over her and her speeder."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
