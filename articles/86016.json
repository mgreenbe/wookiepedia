Men-o-war were used during the Pius Dea Era by both the Pius Dea-controlled Republic Navy and its opponents. They were capable of exchanging fire across broadsides. They saw action during the Pius Dea Crusades when the Pius Dea sect used its control over the Galactic Republic to launch military crusades against alien species in the Outer Rim to subdue chaos in the name of The Goddess. Men-o-war were still in use during the reign of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
