A neutral leader who was the single leader of the Aramandi and the final arbiter of inter-akia disputes, the Taal was also responsible for setting the overall direction for the Aramandi and dealing with otherworlders.

The selection process was laid down by the Eeronon and involved tests of wisdom, intelligence, ruling, combat, strategy, and diplomacy. An honor jury of four members reviewed each candidate, each member drawn from one of the four akias. Taals usually served until their death, although Taals could be removed by the honor jury if supported by the majority of each clan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, the Taal was Arak Omis, who was drawn from the Cirra akia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
