Far below the factory was a smelting plant used to melt, purify, and piped metals to the assembly lines to be poured and stamped. The factory had dozens of assembly lines that worked in tandem to create single, complex items, most often starship components for Rebels, pirates, and mercenaries. Lira Hardin and her engineers could retool the factory in two hours to produce parts from a variety of preprogrammed schematics."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Starship Component Factory was introduced in the 2016 Fantasy Flight Games adventure book Friends Like These as part of the Star Wars: Age of Rebellion roleplaying game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
