It was a blocky-shaped craft that measured a kilometer in length. In 27 ABY, Han Solo and Leia Organa Solo were intent on rendezvousing with the Errant Venture at Nova Station near Carida. When the Venture failed to show, the two instead ran into Plaan. There they learned that the Weequay had left his post on Tholatin and had taken on a special assignment to Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trusting their instincts, they warned Wedge Antilles and General Carlist Rieekan of their suspicions.
