They had burgundy colored feathers. Their culture included a habit that if one of them was harmed by an outsider, they demanded another life in return. They considered it \"proper return of cost\" to demand the return of doubled or tripled price. They were also concerned with matters of public honor and were reluctant to lose their face in front of the crowd.
