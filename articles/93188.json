Although spacers generally held that the planet was somewhere in the Outer Rim Territories, only the Morseerians knew its astronavigational coordinates, and members of the species chose death over revealing this information. The species attained hyperspace technology at some point and spread out beyond their homeworld to found colonies, such as Morseer, with which others most strongly associated them and from which they took their name. This helped them protect the location of their planet of origin because Morseerian colonists and spacers could become the public face of the species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, the Galactic Empire claimed Morseer as its territory after it conquered the Drackmarians, the dominant species in the area and the nominal masters of the Morseerian colonists. The Empire organized a concerted effort to find the Morseerian homeworld, which drove many Morseerians to clandestinely support the Alliance to Restore the Republic and thus sabotage such prying. This subterfuge worked, as the Empire failed to discover the location of the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
