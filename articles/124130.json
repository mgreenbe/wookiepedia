Shatterpoints were akin to fault lines, similar to different pathways of actions. Adept Force users were able to perceive these faults through the Force, and influence them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shatterpoints were perceived like faults in a Corusca gem. In relation to events, a single \"strike,\" or action, could cause events to transpire completely differently than they might otherwise have. Often, shatterpoints existed for only brief moments, as they could be affected by even the smallest actions. Shatterpoints could also be discovered in the physiology of living beings. Cade Skywalker was able to perceive shatterpoints in Darth Talon and Nyna Calixte, whom he had previously healed from mortal injury. By focusing through the Force on where the healing had taken place, Skywalker was able to see where her old wounds were, and reopen them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When applied to physical items, shatterpoints worked much in the same manner. An individual would view an item through the Force, noting where it came together and also noting weak points in its composition. By allowing the Force to surge through them into the weak point, individuals could effectively \"shatter\" the object, causing it to break into multiple fragments. Because the Force granted supernatural ability to those who were adept in its use, materials thought to be near-indestructible were easily destroyed. Such was the case with Jedi Knight Jaina Solo, who effortlessly shattered a disc of pure Mandalorian iron while practicing the technique under her uncle, Luke Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kreia could perceive shatterpoints which she described as \"fractures.\" The status of the two phenomena as one and the same was implicit in Kreia's description of the fractures, which she said could be manipulated by finding the \"critical point.\" Kreia's philosophy hinged in an important way around shatterpoints: prima facie benevolent actions might in fact end harmfully if one was unsure of the myriad repercussions that would follow."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly prior to the First Battle of Geonosis, Mace Windu perceived Count Dooku to be a shatterpoint capable of ending the war. His attachments let his old friend live, however, and so Dooku was able to go on and initiate the Clone Wars. In only a short span of time, the shatterpoint that made Dooku the heart of the war disappeared. Eventually Mace realized a number of shatterpoints connected with Anakin Skywalker, prior to Anakin's fall. Mace was also able to sense the Shatterpoint of Darth Sidious; his trust in Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith Lord Darth Caedus used this ability to destroy the beskar-forged armor of the Mandalorian Protector Roegr. By tapping the breastplate lightly with the hilt of his lightsaber, Caedus was able to completely shatter the armor. When Caedus was still Jacen Solo, he destroyed the blasters of several Centerpoint guards merely by exerting Force pressure in the weak points. Luke Skywalker revealed that he too could perceive shatterpoints, and taught this to Jaina Solo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While in the Temple of the Sith, Kol Skywalker's spirit approached his son Cade and taught him how to use shatterpoint as a tool to defend himself. Cade used this technique to shatter the transparisteel case containing his father's lightsaber and sent the shattered fragments of transparisteel toward the Sith. Cade later used it to destroy the ancient Sith artifact known as the Muur Talisman. He also tried to use shatterpoint to release Deliah Blue from a Yuuzhan Vong bioform that had been attached to her back by Darth Maladi of the One Sith, however, the biot resisted Cade's efforts, also causing excruciating pain to its host when exposed to the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the second draft of Star Wars, the character known as the Starkiller was able to divine the Death Star's weak point using the Force, similar to sensing a shatterpoint."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
