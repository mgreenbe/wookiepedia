In 5 ABY, during a revolution staged by the acolytes in Coronet City on the planet Corellia, Remi was taken to the local Peace and Security station in the city by a detective named Erno, after he caught the boy vandalizing a wall with the message 'Vader lives' and  a picture of Vader's armor on it. After being rescued by Kiza, a Pantoran female and fellow acolyte, Remi went to the archives located underneath the station and returned with a red bladed lightsaber which he used to cut off one of Erno's hands."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to the Battle of Jakku, Remi and his fellow Acolytes traveled to the planet Devaron. Remi grew besotted with his new lightsaber acquisition and delved deeper into the dark side of the Force. Remi incurred the wrath of the late Emperor Palpatine's former adviser Yupe Tashu when he expressed jealousy that Kiza had received the mask of Viceroy Exim Panshard. As punishment, Tashu stripped him of the lightsaber and handed it to Kiza. Overcome by rage and jealousy, Remi tried to recover his blade from Kiza during the attack on a New Republic outpost.

Following the Battle of Endor, Remi began experiencing Force visions of fallen Sith who had gone to the Beyond. He joined a cult known as the Acolytes of the Beyond, who revered the Sith and the dark side of the Force. During that time, Remi befriended and became romantically attached to a Pantoran girl named Kiza, who was also an Acolyte. Remi played a role in planning and organizing the Coronet City revolution. He falsified the papers which enabled Kiza to infiltrate the local Peace and Security station disguised as a secretary.

However, Remi remained defiant. When Erno dismissed the Acolytes as a \"buncha suck-ups\" for the Empire, Remi responded that he was not serving the Empire but something greater. Erno then asked Remi why he was not wearing a mask and remarked that Vader was a bad guy. Remi responded by asking Erno if he was a good man. When Erno questioned him about the mask again, Remi responded that an Acolyte had to earn it. Remi then added that the building was old and that he knew that the museum next door shared the basement with the P&S station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before Erno could question the boy further, the security officer Spob Rydel entered the interrogation room to inform Erno that the Acolytes were attacking Coronet City.
