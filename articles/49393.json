Although not as fast or capable of attaining the same altitude as a Galan starfighter, floaters used by the military were armed with missiles and blasters that could be used to attack the opposing Melida or Daan forces and defend their own territory. Obi-Wan Kenobi flew against at least seven floaters with Nield and Cerasi while destroying the deflection towers used to operate particle shields that protected the capital city of Zehava from intruders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
