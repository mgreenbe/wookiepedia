Despite the Teedos' warnings, Rey, a human scavenger, didn't share their faith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "R'iia was first mentioned in Before the Awakening, a junior novel written by Greg Rucka and published in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
