Bo-rifles had a long tradition in the Lasat culture, and were used exclusively by the Lasan High Honor Guard. Since the destruction of Lasan by the Empire, bo-rifles were rarely seen anywhere in the galaxy. They strongly resembled electrostaffs when in their extended state. Agent Kallus used a similar J-19 bo-rifle, which he was given by a defeated foe during the Siege of Lasan. AB-75 bo-rifles could switch from a blaster rifle to an electrostaff in 1.36 seconds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
