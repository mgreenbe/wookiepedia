She possessed a fragment of the Codex of Tython, an ancient Jedi Holocron. An Alliance to Restore the Republic agent seeking to reassemble the holocron came looking for Min, using the Key of Exile provided by Sarguillo, to access the Chamber. There, he found several Nightsisters guarding a large crystal which contained the essence of Axkva Min trapped within. The Codex, possessed by the Rebel, then launched a bolt of energy to the crystal, destroying it and freeing Axkva Min. She attacked the intruder, but was defeated and offered him to take her life, seeing it as a preferable fate to eternal imprisonment. The Rebel, however, was only looking for a crystal on a chain around the witch's neck. When this fragment installed back into the Code, another arc of energy jumped from the Codex to the banishment crystal. The figure of Axkva Min was transported inside again, and the scattered pieces of the crystal reformed themselves with her essence inside. Once again, the Queen of the Nightsisters was trapped within."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later she was killed by a group of spacers as she attempted to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A portrait of the former Nightsister Queen managed to survive her death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Axkva Min appeared as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
