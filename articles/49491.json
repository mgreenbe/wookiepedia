A race of spindly limbs, each Fluggrian had three fingers on each hand ending in a large talon. Their skin was dotted with several sensory inputs in the form of purple spikes, which were capable of processing information at a high rate of speed. Large, square teeth filled their mouths and were hidden behind thick lips. Breathing through gill-like neck bands, the Fluggrians could breathe oxygen with ease."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Native to a marshy planet called Ploo IV, the Fluggrians lived on floating cities which connected via thick underwater transit tubes.
