It was formed in 1 ABY, when a Corellia University expedition carried out an archaeological expedition to the Temple of Exar Kun on Yavin 4. They accidentally uncovered the catacombs beneath the temple, which reawakened the spirit of Exar Kun. The spirit enslaved them to it, making them into fanatical cultists that were devoted to its worship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A number of the cultists traveled to a Corellia University research outpost on Talus and recruited some new members to their ranks from among the students and researchers there.
