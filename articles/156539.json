They were humanoid, and their skin color was a bright to olive green with darker green mottled spots on their head and arms. The species had small green fins on the backs of their forearms and calves. Some individuals had hair on their heads, but they were otherwise hairless. Both sexes had very small ears and gill-like structures on the sides of their necks, and females had breasts. Their eyes were round with a large round pupil, and their teeth were noticeably sharp."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clode Rhoden, Madam Rhoden, and Buck were of this species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
