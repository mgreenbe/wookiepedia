Ruwahurr endeavored to open a dialogue with them, but the alien haters showed no interest in peaceful talks. Soon after, they kidnapped Ruwahurr's assistant, a Selonian healer. Ruwahurr met a spacer who was willing to help the ambassador. The spacer ambushed the alien haters, freed the assistant and escorted the Selonian to safety. Then Ruwahurr learned from a friend that the alien haters had hired a bounty hunter to kidnap the diplomat. Once again the ambassador could rely on the helpful adventurer who tracked down the bounty hunter and killed him in a fight to the death.
