These buildings were often built on worlds with strong Consortium influence, and served as the center for Consortium monetary dealings there. The building was well-defended, making it harder for Rebel or Imperial forces to destroy it. They were also equipped with a shield generator and a communications array. This structure could also create Defilers, Mobile Defense Units, and Ewok Handlers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
