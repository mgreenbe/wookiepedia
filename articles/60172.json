As construction was started, it was discovered that the Ranats, a large species of omnivorous rodents, lived on the planet. The Ranats attacked the workers, the crew was defeated, and the project ended in disaster. Trebors cause the Ranat to be considered a semi-sentient species, because if an Imperial governor declared that the Ranat were semi-sentient, more extreme measures could be used to wipe out the intelligent rodents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
