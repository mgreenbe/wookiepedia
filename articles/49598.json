The mining crews refused to go out unless the Mensix Mining Company could take care of the problem, so Chief Ulon Glost hired an expert hunter to track down the beast and kill it. The hunter was still searching for the tulrus, when Chief Glost received news of yet another attack on a mining camp.

After a fierce fight, the hunter killed Foehorn and returned to the Mensix Mining Facility."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Foehorn was a creature in Trials of Obi-Wan, the third expansion for Sony Online Entertainment's MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
