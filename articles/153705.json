To heal the boy, a shaman passed a totem through the boy's throat. Although Hoole feared the trinket would cause the boy to choke, it went down safely. The shaman reported that once the totem passed, the boy's sickness would pass as well. Hoole's description of the event was later added to the entry on the Kurtzen species in The Essential Guide to Alien Species, published during the regime of the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
