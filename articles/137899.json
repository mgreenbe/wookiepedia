A healthy population of symers kept the population of the scavenging tymps to a minimum. Unfortunately for the Seratians, they believed that the organs and appendages of the symer contained mystical powers, and killed the predators just to obtain them. The destruction of the symer population allowed the tymps to reproduce at a prodigious rate, which eventually threatened to eliminate the supplies of roti consumed by the Seratians."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
