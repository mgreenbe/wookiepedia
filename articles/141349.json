The ability was virtually ubiquitous among Force-sensitive individuals and organizations, though the techniques could differ greatly. It had a tremendous number of applications, both combative and utilitarian."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The primary purpose of most telekinetic powers was to manipulate physical matter, allowing the user to touch, hold, and otherwise move with a target. Force-users could use this ability to push, pull, and lift targets. It could also be used to disarm or physically attack opponents, as well as a method of defense for the user or the target. For a sufficiently skilled or powerful practitioner, the size, distance, weight, and mass of the object did not matter. One could lift something as small as a piece of fruit to an X-Wing or be able to affect a target from another room or even several light-years away while looking at them through a holocomm or viewscreen, so long as they possessed physical awareness of the target's location in relation to themselves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Telekinesis also entailed applying and defying physical forces without physical contact and from a distance, with the strength and intensity of this force causing the feats performed with it ranging from making small to medium-sized objects float or levitate weightlessly, to slowing or completely halting the motion of moving targets, to crushing targets with the strength and resilience of metal with extreme amounts of pressure. This manipulation of force can also be enough to generate shockwaves, vibrations, and even seismic energy, as well as concussive or explosive force, which could be used to repel, damage, or destroy targets. In addition, telekinesis could also utilize the air to achieve its effects by manipulating air pressure, currents, and pockets. This allowed a user to perform feats, such as creating explosive bursts of force or powerful winds. Not only could it be utilized for an attack, but telekinesis could allow a user to create a usually invisible field or barrier of physical force with various sizes, shapes, and intensities for defense. Many of these abilities could manifest generated directly from or around the user's body."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the ability allowing the user the ability to manipulate and interact with targets without physical contact and from a variable distance, the precision, accuracy, magnitude, range, and intensity of the ability were tied to the users' concentration, willpower, emotions, senses, and spatial awareness. Therefore, a user's power could be weakened, causing said user to be unable to properly control it.  For most users, physical or mental fatigue, stress, or disorientation would subsequently nullify the use of such an ability."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the many possible applications of telekinesis, the power often could cause physical and mental stress and exhaustion, especially when used on objects larger or heavier than the user or that already had greater amounts of force being exerted on it, such as falling objects or moving vehicles. The size, weight, and distance of a target could also affect how quickly and how easily it could be moved by the user. As the target was influenced by the user's sheer concentration and conscious effort, most Force-users were naturally unable to focus their abilities upon multiple targets for long periods and required their physical senses, such as sight and hearing, to be able to lock onto their target. In the event of exhausting or stressing their powers or themselves, physically or mentally, users would require time to regain their composure before being able to continue using their abilities properly. Additionally, Force users actively utilizing the ability were often left unable to perform other tasks in the meantime, including moving in the most extreme cases, as they were forced to divert most of their concentration and effort on the specific task, which could leave them vulnerable in dangerous scenarios such as open combat, lest they be interrupted and lose their hold on their target. Such instances would regularly hamper or limit the ability's use, especially in combat, resulting in Force users resorting to physical combat, especially with the use of a lightsaber. Alternatively, a user's telekinetic strength could be enhanced by intense emotions such as stress, anger, hate, fear, desperation, which lessened the effort of maintaining a hold on a targeted object or allowed a user to apply abnormally precise or extreme amounts of force beyond their natural limits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ability is usually channeled through bodily gestures, specifically the motion of the eyes, hands, fingers, or occasionally the entire body.  Such gestures are the most common way to use the power, especially when the user's mind or senses are strained or overwhelmed, as the user requires comparatively less concentration, focus, and effort to manifest their ability. However, the feature can also limit the use of one's abilities if the user is restrained or otherwise rendered immobile."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Applications"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Telekinesis had an extraordinary number of applications. These abilities were used to move objects, people, and so on. They could be used in both a utility-oriented manner, or as a form of attack."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Move Object"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The basic use of telekinesis that involved stretching out one's feelings and will through the Force to take physical hold of a targeted object or objects, exerting one's will on it so that it performed as the user wished. The Force power functioned on the theory that the Force reacts to a Force-user's strength of will, allowing a user to apply the Force with their mind to some other space or object. While this technique allows the user to exerts force on a target as if they where physically interacting with it, it can also be used to suspend force already exerted on a target, such as gravity, allowing a user to levitate a target, defying its weight, or to attract and repel an object in a similar manner to magnetic or gravitational force. Savage Opress managed to stop a knife thrown by Sugi just before it reached the head of Darth Maul during a mission."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Force Pull"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A telekinetic ability using the Force that could cause a material body to draw close to the user. The greater the user's aptitude with this, the heavier the object that could be pulled or the more wide arc or radius of the Force \"wave\". It could be used to pull weapons from enemies, or, at higher levels of skill, could be used to pull enemies themselves closer to a Jedi's lightsaber range. This power was also very useful when a chasm or hole lay between the caster and the opponent. It could also be used to pull foes to the ground. One of the most powerful uses of the ability was pulling a starship from the sky. In 3641 BBY, Khem Val claimed that Tulak Hord once pulled a ship the size of the Endar Spire onto a planet's surface. In 2 BBY, Galen Marek demonstrated the ability on Raxus Prime. Although unsure if he could, with great effort he managed to use the Force on an already-falling Imperial I-class Star Destroyer, turning it and sending it crashing into a Imperial ore facility."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Force Push"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The most basic applications of Force Push utilized telekinetically-derived force to push objects away from the user. It could be used to varying degrees, from simply nudging or softly moving targets away from the user, to shoving and staggering them, to knocking them backwards or to the ground, to sending them flying through the air. Functioning as both an offensive and defensive technique, the ability was a common method for Force users in repelling opponents or clearing obstacles."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At more powerful levels, Force Push could manifest as a telekinetic impulse created with the Force, generating a concussive burst of pressurized air akin to an explosive force from the user's body that impacts against the target like a projectile. Depending on the power and skill of the user, this ability could be used to do anything from shoving or staggering a target to shattering stone. The greater the user's telekinetic aptitude, the larger the pressure differential, and thus the stronger the effect and the heavier the target. With practice, a skilled Force user could increase the range and arc of the blast without lowering the average kinetic energy, creating a blanketing wave instead of a focused pulse. Truly gifted practitioners could generate a concussive blast that would radiate from them for dozens of meters in all directions, detonating with the physical force of a conventional explosive. Starkiller, while under the influence of Force rage, was capable of releasing a blast powerful enough to disintegrate Force-insensitive foes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This technique was an effective tool for keeping enemies at a distance. Particularly ruthless Force users could use a well-timed Force Push to send their enemies tumbling off balconies or into deep chasms. Additionally, Force users who were exceptionally skilled or powerful could even use Force Push to kill their opponents via the sheer force of the Push itself. Both Darth Vader and Galen Marek demonstrated this ability on multiple occasions. Beyond offense, this power had many utilitarian applications, such as removing or pulverizing heavy debris and other obstructions too large to remove without specialized equipment. Alternatively Force Push was still capable of being less directly damaging, as a burst of telekinetic energy could be used to harmlessly deflect large projectiles such as rockets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A trained Force user could resist a Force Push, presumably by shielding themselves with telekinetic energy of their own. However, this shielding could be penetrated or overwhelmed by an opponent of sufficient skill or power. Alternatively, depending on the user's level of power and skill, beings with a sufficient amount of physical strength and resilience could potentially resist the full force of a Force Push."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Force Grip"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A highly versatile and adaptable use of telekinesis, as it was used to grip a target, usually an enemy, with the Force. This technique was used either to restrain or immobilize its target, forcibly control the target's movements, or, at a high enough degree, apply a damaging amount of pressure that had the potential to crush an opponent's bones and organs. This ability had the potential to cancel out the motion of a target to not only reduce its speed, but to completely halt and suspend it in place. Oftentimes, the target of the ability was not only seized with great strength, but also lifted off the ground and suspended in the air. Due to its potential for bringing harm and its prioritization on controlling and dominating a target, Force Grip and its variations are often regarded as dark side techniques. However, as a Jedi could use it to peacefully and harmlessly immobilize an opponent, the ability could be used without accessing the dark side and without using emotions related to the dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The grip was commonly applied to not simply to levitate targets, but to exert physical force on a target to simulate physical contact. This allowed a user to grasp, squeeze or constrict a specific part of their victim, such as the neck, or, potentially, to exert an equal amount of pressure on the entire body to better restrain and incapacitate them. More powerful users of the technique were quite capable of lifting the intended target off the ground and moving them through the air. The technique is often synonymous with Force Choke, the main difference between the two was that the choke was specifically aimed at the neck, or even more specifically, the throat or trachea of its victim and was primarily used for restricting air and blood flow. The grip, on the other hand, could target multiple parts of the body at once and could be used to pin or slam its targets into walls or ceilings, throw them great distances, or to bring them over a fall or towards the user for a close-range attack. However, these techniques would often coincide, as a user could telekinetically grab, hold or even lift their target by the neck with or without choking or strangling them in the process."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some used this provision as an advantage to escape the Grip's clutches; Jedi could implement Force Persuasion or Force blinding to obscure a Grip-user's vision, or some could immediately leap to escape it (with mixed results in either case, depending on the user's knowledge of the Force). Boba Fett was known to have been able to escape a Force Grip by firing his jetpack, utilizing the external propulsion to fly safely out of the Grip-user's line of sight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If one could not escape the sight of a Grip-user, the next best method was to disrupt the user's concentration. Jedi in the time of the New Republic could commonly do this by simply pushing their enemy with the Force, and others were known to have broken a Grip by blasting the user with a weapon. These solutions were both limited, however; those most powerful in the use of the technique could maintain concentration during a Force Push, and even more could control the Grip so well that the choked target would not be able to even draw his or her weapon. A skilled user would not restrict himself to only the grip to subdue opponents, some would take the opportunity to simultaneously move an opponent over a fall, throw him, slam him into a wall, or merely force an opponent to disable his lightsaber, then follow with an attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, those most experienced and skilled with Force Grip were able to apply it without a direct visual of their target or even being in the target's immediate vicinity, so long as they knew their target's location relative to themselves. Oftentimes, users that were sufficiently skilled and powerful enough in the Force were able to apply the technique while viewing their target through a viewscreen or hologram."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Force users known to have used this power included Count Dooku, who used it on Obi-Wan Kenobi when Obi-Wan and Anakin Skywalker boarded General Grievous's flagship to rescue Supreme Chancellor Palpatine; and Desann, who used the power at least once on Kyle Katarn. Dooku in particular demonstrated the use of the technique to forcibly manipulate the motor functions of others, such as when he Force choked Turk Falso while simultaneously forcing the pirate to draw his blaster and shoot his comrade. He performed a similar feat when he made Padm\u00e9 Amidala aim at and shoot Bec Lawise. Additionally Grandmaster Yoda used the technique to freeze his former apprentice's Sith assassin, Asajj Ventress in place as she was attempting to strike down King Katuunko on Toydaria before throwing her aside."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kyle Katarn himself used this very Force power, for he first exercised a degree of control over Force Grip during the Reborn crisis, against Tavion Axmis, who had enraged Katarn by her involvement in his partner's apparent death. Though Katarn released Axmis once she revealed that the supposed killing was a ruse, and though he would quiet his anger from that moment forth, Katarn would continue to demonstrate the power through the rest of his days. Darth Vader's apprentice, Galen Marek, was also extremely competent with Grip and employed it as one of his primary weapons. Anakin Skywalker was seen using it in his duel with Barriss Offee at the Jedi Temple, preventing her from attacking and ending the duel. When he became Vader, he would routinely utilize it against fellow Force users, and developed his skill with it to the point that he could grip and throw even Starkiller with it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Derivatives of Force Pull"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Force Rend"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rend was a dark power that allowed the practitioner to move a single target, be it creature or object, in two different directions simultaneously, potentially tearing the target apart or otherwise damaging it."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Force Disarm"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Force Disarm used the Force to pull a weapon from an opponent's grasp.  The Force-user could then choose to have the weapon fly into his hand. Yoda used Force Disarm to disarm Asajj Ventress when she tried to assassinate Toydarian King Katuunko, though it is noted that due to Yoda's greater power in the Force, he would have been able to overwhelm any attempts of Ventress to resist his power with her own. Prior to the Occupation of Bespin, Darth Vader used this power to disarm Han Solo as part of the capture of Solo and his companions by Imperial forces. Starkiller had employed force disarm against riot troopers by taking their weapons and using it as a weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Derivatives of Force Push"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Force Wave"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the most powerful forms of Force Push, it was essentially a wave of pure Force energy that pulsed out from the Force user that utilized it which knocked back anything within the power's blast radius.\nThe strength of Force Wave was extremely potent, and its raw power was on more than one occasion described as a telekinetic explosion. It was more widespread, like a wave, hence the name, and could push multiple opponents at once. It was very useful in tight, cramped quarters when the Force user needed room to move, since Force users could damage their opponents by pushing them into the walls. It could also be used as \"crowd control,\" when overwhelming numbers of enemies immediately swarm toward the user. Using Force Wave could be used to give the Force user time to rethink their strategy and cast more Force powers, or they could also attack fallen opponents as they are stunned. The technique was almost completely synonymous with Force Shockwave."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mace Windu and Yoda used this power against B2 super battle droids during the Battle of Coruscant. Mace also used this power when he lost his lightsaber on Dantooine in the Clone Wars. This power was also used by Darth Bane against his former lightsaber instructor on Lehon to bring part of the Temple of the Ancients down on him, killing him. Darth Plagueis was powerful enough to use a Force Wave to nearly atomize six Maladian assassins after being seriously injured in a surprise attack. Darth Vader was also capable of utilizing this ability, showcasing his skill during the Gentis Coup when he used one to kill dozens of Gentis's soldiers simultaneously. Luke Skywalker also used this move during his Duel with Darth Caedus. The most powerful known user of this ability was the dark-side entity Abeloth, who once produced a wave so powerful that it destroyed the city of Tahv, disintegrating nearby beings and materials and causing objects further away to be shredded."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Force Repulse"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An extremely powerful telekinetic Force power similar in function to Force Push, and perhaps even more to Force Blow, but on a far larger scale, akin to that of Force Wave, Force Repulse was no more or less than a gigantic telekinetic explosion. The user would concentrate on the Force and violently push it outwards, creating rapidly-expanding kinetic ripples in space, flinging nearby objects away at high velocity. The power only affected objects a certain distance away from the user, and therefore could be avoided by moving further away from the user. The primary difference between it and the Force Wave ability appeared to be that a Repulse always functioned as a spherical explosion that radiated from the user, while a Force Wave typically functioned in a circular or hemi-circular fashion. Darth Vader was a master of this ability, as were his apprentices, Galen Marek and Starkiller. Obi-Wan Kenobi also utilized it during the Battle of Muunilinst against the bounty hunter Durge, causing an explosion of Force energy that blew the Gen'Dai apart from within. Perhaps the most notably powerful user of the ability was Galen Marek's clone Starkiller, who could produce a repulse so violent and powerful that it could disintegrate enemies and the surrounding objects caught in the blast. Similar abilities to this were Force Shockwave and the dark side technique of Force Destruction. In addition, a more powerful technique of this was Force Maelstrom, which combined a telekinetic explosive field with a Protection bubble and the dark side ability of Force Lightning to cause nearby objects to orbit the field and then be shot out in all directions in a forceful blast charged with Force Lightning."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Force Blast"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Force Blast was a powerful telekinetic exertion of the Force that was basically a more powerful version of Force Push, where the user would (hence it's name) blast opponents and obstacles out of the way in a much more violent manner than a simple push. Galen Marek was a notable user of this ability. Darth Vader was also capable of using this power, as demonstrated during the Battle of Kamino when he used the technique to shatter Starkiller's lightsabers."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Force Burst"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Force Burst was a sphere of concentrated Force energy shot at or sent after a target at the utmost accuracy and speed. The strength of the Burst depended on the amount of time and energy put into it. A Burst's size and intensity could range anywhere from huge and combustible, to small but relatively deadly. It was usually semi-transparent with a blue or green shade, while the Sith variant had a reddish shade. This ability shared similar characteristics to Force Destruction, but was not a power exclusive to the dark side."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Force Destruction"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Force Destruction was a massive energy field that could manifest in a sphere capable of blanketing a large radius, paralyzing or even vaporizing those in its path. It was generated from dark side energy built up and stored within the user's body until released, typically through the arm or hand. Even those who escaped direct contact with the blast would be pushed asunder by the power's backlash. Despite this, the ability was considerably exhaustive due to the amount of effort and concentration it took to use even but a few times, making it unreliable as a standard form of attack.  This ability was notably used by the Inquisitor Jerec, Darth Bane and Galen Marek."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Force Orb"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Force Orb was created from pure Force energy that obstructed the surrounding environment, forming a bubble of air. Under normal circumstances, it only worked underwater.\nKit Fisto utilized it during the Battle of Mon Calamari, creating a ball of air underwater and using it to disable a crab cannon. During the Battle of Mon Cala, Kit Fisto and Anakin Skywalker attempted to use this power to make a makeshift air helmet for Padm\u00e9 Amidala to breath when Riff Tamson broke her helmet spitefully with his jaws. They succeeded, but Jar Jar Binks's Gungan saliva proved a more effective seal."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Force Throw"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A combination of Force Push and Force Grip, this technique is used to cause objects, and even people, to be hurled toward a target or an area at an astounding velocity. A skilled Force user could throw multiple, large objects simultaneously at great speed, as evidenced by Palpatine during his duel with Yoda in the Grand Convocation Chamber of the Senate Building, during which he hurled repulsorpods at the Jedi Master. Anakin Skywalker used this ability when he was attacked on Geonosis, hurling droideka arms at oncoming Geonosian warriors. As Darth Vader, he used it to defeat Jedi Knight Roan Shryne in combat on Kashyyyk. He later used it to overwhelm and subdue his own son, Luke Skywalker, during their battle in Cloud City on Bespin."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Force Whirlwind"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A more advanced form of Force Push, and a rather feeble version of Force Wave. The Jedi would alter the air currents around an opponent, turning it into a maelstrom. This swirling force would lift an opponent into the air, spin them around, and leave them incapable of moving out of it. This allowed the Jedi to attack without resistance. One of the most notable uses of this ability was from Jacen Solo when confronting Tsavong Lah on Duro. Jedi Master Streen and Teneniel Djo demonstrated a natural talent for this ability, as well as Plo Koon, who further modified it with his knowledge.\nDarth Malak used this ability during his confrontation with Revan on the Leviathan. The former Dark Lord of the Sith, as well as the Ho'Din Jedi Master Plett may also have known how to use it. This ability was known to the Witches of Dathomir as the Spell of Storm. Meetra Surik and her companions may also have used this Force power during her quest to save the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Force Barrier"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Force Barrier was both a defensive and offensive technique that allowed the user to create a barrier or wall of Force energy around the intended target, be it self, friend, or foe. This barrier could be insulated against both physical matter and energies, to the point where a strong enough barrier could defend against sonic attacks. Obi-Wan Kenobi used this technique when a bounty hunter was firing at him with a sonic boom grenade launcher. However, the strength of the barrier could eventually weaken with constant battering and exhaustion of the user."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Valenthyne Farfalla demonstrated this when briefly encasing Darth Bane in a Force Barrier and halted his attacks by building up energy of a barrier and single concentrated burst, until Bane broke free and the shield exploded into energy fragments.

Darth Vader demonstrated this by choking Admiral Kendal Ozzel over a viewscreen, even though the admiral was on the bridge and Vader was in his meditation chamber. However, this ability requires extreme focus upon the object at hand, any break of concentration and the choke would be removed and the target's freedom of movement restored. Some individuals were also powerful enough and experienced enough to not require any visuals to kill someone via Force Choke, such as when Letta Turmond's Jedi backer, later revealed to be Barriss Offee, killed her via a Force Choke and subsequently framed Ahsoka Tano for the deed, as well as when Darth Sidious used the ability to kill the Shadow Collective guards standing near the door before opening it to confront his former apprentice, Darth Maul and the latter's apprentice, Savage Opress. Darth Vader was also seen using this ability to express his dissatisfaction with an Imperial officer during one of his Jedi hunts, choking the man while staring pointedly away from him. Shortly thereafter, he did something similar to Kento Marek, breaking the Jedi's neck via a Force Grip while he was looking away from him. Emperor Palpatine could also choke a target remotely, such as when he punished Admiral Termo for speaking out of turn during a hologram communication."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Vader was in fact one of the most infamous users of this Force technique, often choking those who displeased or had failed him, in a clear and powerful demonstration of the Force to any non-believers in view of the grim display.

After futile attempts by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to gain intelligence from the Separatist leader, Anakin lost his temper when the captured Poggle refused to give him vital information that might save Skywalker's Padawan Ahsoka Tano and Barriss Offee from the brain worms.

Luke also used it on one of the Nightsisters. In both instances, he used his ability to disable his opponent, not to kill them. In 40 ABY, Jacen Solo used this technique against a female Hapan officer who questioned his authority to chastise her, releasing her afterward. He also Force-choked Patra Tebut for disobeying orders, this time to lethal effect. Kueller used Force choke on Femon. Gorc, who would keep a victim stationary while his \"brother\" Picaroon C.
