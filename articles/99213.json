The panel was instituted at Vox Chun's request to determine Kenobi's guilt on a more formal level since he was dissatisfied with the report that the Jedi High Council provided him with. Chun had Senator Sano Sauro prosecute the case for him while Kenobi relied on his master and friend to provide testimonies that led to his innocence affirmed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Dark Jedi Xanatos infiltrated the Jedi Temple in 44 BBY and corrupted the initiate Bruck Chun to the dark side to become his apprentice. Chun became responsible for several robberies at his new master's request and also kidnapped fellow initiate Bant Eerin and threatened to kill her. The former Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi (who decided to return to the Jedi Order) confronted Chun in the Room of a Thousand Fountains and was unable to save Chun from falling to his death in their duel. Xanatos later died in a confrontation on Telos but the encounter with Chun left Kenobi reeling in guilt."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chun's father and brother visited the Jedi Temple in the aftermath to listen to the Jedi High Council deliver their report to the Chun's about Bruck's death; Kenobi was in attendance but the report left him feeling additional guilt. The Council informed Kenobi that the Chun's decided to demand a formal investigation into Bruck's death. Kenobi's master Qui-Gon Jinn knew the toll it would take on Kenobi and told him that the truth would ensure that his innocence would be upheld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The trial"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The investigation resulted in a formal hearing commissioned before several senators including Sano Sauro who was a close friend to the Chun's and would help prosecute their case. Jinn first took the stand to recall Xanatos' brazen attack on the Temple and how he lured Bruck to the dark side. Eerin spoke next about her near-death experience which was due to Bruck's actions. Senator Vi Callen was sympathetic to the Jedi and continued to question Sauro's aggressive line of questioning throughout the hearing while Pi T'Egal grew frustrated that some of the questions Sauro gave were not relevant enough to the hearing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kenobi was forced to provide his own account about the incident without his master present for support. Eerin was there but Jinn was at Centax-2 with Jedi Master Tahl to investigate sabotage on the station and its starfighter program that an old friend was leading. Kenobi received swift cross-examination from Sauro but Jinn arrived with new evidence that he wished to submit to the panel. Jinn explained that he remembered something about Xanatos and said it was probable to him that he would have monitored Chun's conversation with a listening device fitted on him somehow. He inferred that the device was in Chun's lightsaber and was able to provide it to the senators who listened to the recordings that also detailed Chun's final moments and implicated him in the events that took place in the Temple including Eerin's attempted murder. The senators proclaimed Kenobi innocent (despite Sauro's dissention; he conferred with the Chun's as the senators deliberated) and said that the matter would not be taken further up."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sauro conferred with the elder Chun who railed against the Jedi following a ruling that he believed to be biased."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kad Chun tried to attack Kenobi after the trial and struck him in the jaw before twisting his wrist and failing to further attack him during the scuffle. Chun went from that trial denouncing Kenobi and branding him a killer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chun went on in the following decade to lead Telosian people aboard the BioCruiser alongside his aged father. Kenobi (now a Jedi Knight) was dispatched to the BioCruiser in 29 BBY with his Padawan Anakin Skywalker where the pair discovered sabotage and where Chun was less than enthused with their presence. Kenobi discovered that the Offworld Mining Corporation was behind the sabotage while further investigation implicated Vox Chun and Tarrence Chenati (the same man causing sabotage on Centax-2 during Kenobi's trial). Kenobi saved Chun's life while Vox died; Kenobi and Chun were able to save the people aboard before guiding the damaged vessel to Tentrix for repairs. It was there that Chun reconciled with Kenobi and apologized thus ending a hatred lasting more than a decade while providing both men with a sense of peace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
