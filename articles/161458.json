Members of the group would pass their ideas and methods on to other droids, even those not built for military purposes, and try to sway them to their cause. They held that all sentients were culpable in the continued slavery of droids, and as such, any organic being was a target."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
