This caused the cannon to \"fire\" the ore sphere at a much higher speed than it was designed for, causing it to collide with and destroy the Star Destroyer production facility in orbit. The cannon itself was destroyed when Galen Marek pulled the lone surviving Star Destroyer down to the planet's surface, by means of the Force, annihilating both the cannon and the destroyer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
