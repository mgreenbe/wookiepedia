After Torra leaves, Kaz looks down to discover the animal has vanished. He quickly finds Buggles on the other side of the Fireball, eating from a bowl of food, and attempts to collect him, only for the Voorpak to run outside. Kaz thinks Buggles has fallen into the ocean, but sees him pestering a bird on the precarious ledges on the edge of the Colossus. He goes after Buggles, putting himself in danger, but the pet bounds off again. Back in the repair shop, Kaz is unsuccessfully searching for Buggles when Torra returns and asks him where he is. Just then Buggles, inside the Fireball, presses some buttons, causing the ship to take off. Torra asks Kaz who's flying the ship, and Kaz nervously admits that it's Buggles, causing Torra to look alarmed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The short's title misspells Buggles' name while adding a possessive apostrophe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
