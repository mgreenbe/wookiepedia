A harmless and even friendly creature, the tach could often be found on the ground searching for overripe fruits. It was characterized by its bright, reddish skin, fur that was white on the head and grayish-blue elsewhere, and long tail with a tassel-like tip. It walked on all fours, and its arms were longer than its legs. In 14 BBY, during Cal Kestis' mission to Kashyyyk, he found several tachs living on the Origin Tree whilst climbing it. His droid companion, BD-1, then scanned the creatures, supplying Cal with information on them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tachs first appeared in the current Star Wars canon in the 2017 video game Star Wars Battlefront II.
