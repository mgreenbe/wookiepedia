A four-meter long repulsorlift vehicle. It was crewed by a single pilot, carried two passengers and 200 kilograms of cargo. The vehicle had a flight ceiling of a hundred and fifty kilometers. Below ten kilometers from ground level, it could only achieve sixty hundred and fifty kilometers per hour; at greater heights, it could travel a thousand and fifty kilometers per hour."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The craft had a forward concussion missile launcher, and was one of the few private vehicles to carry armament. Being so lightly-armed, it was seldom used by military or police, instead being used by the companies' enforcers and criminal elements, such as the Bounty Hunters' Guild. It was armored though, comparable to Incom Corporation's T-47 airspeeder, which was used by the Alliance to Restore the Republic on Hoth. Unlike the T-47, the Orbitblade's cockpit was environmentally sealed, able to protect the occupants from a poisonous atmosphere, such as that on Drackmar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
