The structure was heated from within by an underground geyser that led into the Geyser Sea. The base was used primarily by Colonel Odan and his forces as well as the native Akurians. After the capture of the mobile fortress, the War Sled, by Imperial forces, Odan, the only one to escape the capture of the War Sled, made his way to the Snow Structure where he collaborated with the Rebel sympathizing Akurians. After a failed rescue of the Rebel heroes, Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker from the ruse of an Imperial commander posing as Odan, the Akurians brought back R2-D2 and C-3PO to the Snow Structure, where they planned their next rescue."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
