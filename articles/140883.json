The resulting skirmishes between the Tuskens and settlers kept the Tatooine authorities busy, and unable to focus on Jabba the Hutt's dealings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the planned execution of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca over the Great Pit of Carkoon, Skywalker equipped himself with a lightsaber previously hidden in the Astromech droid R2-D2.

As Klaatu retreated into the main hold, Dren-garen erupted from a top-mounted hatch at the front of the deck from behind Skywalker, catching him completely unawares. Dren-garen shot Skywalker's right hand, at the moment Skywalker raised his green-bladed saber above his head. Skywalker struck out at Taym with his lightsaber, slashing him across his weapon-holding hand. With a howl of pain, Taym Dren-garen fell backwards through the hatch into the depths of the Khetanna."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Taym Dren-garen was portrayed by Larry Holt in Return of the Jedi.
