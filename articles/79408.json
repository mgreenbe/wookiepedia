The ship was named after Ymile, the girlfriend of Dominic Raynor, who secretly helped Lando win Cloud City from Raynor, and whom Lando nicknamed his \"Lady Luck\" for her assistance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lando owned numerous starships throughout his long career, but the Lady Luck was the one that remained in his possession the longest. Calrissian obtained Lady Luck from an Orthellin royal mistress after the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lando lost the Lady Luck on Kessel in 11 ABY, after being forced to leave it there. He feared that it would be disassembled by the pirate forces, but when the Smugglers' Alliance came to Kessel to begin a spice mining operation, they found the Luck unharmed where Lando had left it. Mara Jade personally presented it to him when he returned to Kessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 12 ABY when Lando was captured by the Rodian gangster Reelo Baruk, the ship was impounded in a Nar Shaddaa hangar bay, guarded by many of Baruk's thugs. With the help of Kyle Katarn, Lando escaped from Reelo Baruk's hideout, and the two prepared to escape the planet, but not before Baruk made one last ditch effort to stop the two New Republic heroes. Utilizing an E-Web heavy repeating blaster cannon and a handful of thugs, Baruk attempted to damage the vessel beyond repair, though fortunately for the luxury starship, Kyle Katarn held off the attackers using one of Lady Luck's cannons. The Lady Luck escaped Baruk's compound on Nar Shaddaa and headed to Cloud City on Bespin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Black Fleet Crisis, Lando went with Colonel Pakkpekatt to investigate the Teljkon Vagabond. He and his crew attached Lady Luck to the Vagabond's hull after getting past its defenses. The group managed to uncover the secrets of the Vagabond."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 17 ABY, Lando flew it to the Skip 1 on the Smuggler's Run, in search of Han Solo. However, after he was captured by Nandreeson, the smugglers there presumed him to be dead and gutted the interior of the ship, taking whatever they could get. After Lando was rescued by Han, he returned to Skip 1 and salvaged what he could of the Lady Luck's former contents. Shortly after, he used it to transport injured smugglers to Wrea, when Kueller detonated a series of bombs that devastated the run."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lando continued to use the Luck during the Yuuzhan Vong War and flew it during the Battle of Ebaq. During the climactic Battle of Yuuzhan'tar, the advanced sensor systems of the Lady Luck proved invaluable, allowing Lando and his wife Tendra Risant to relay important information to Galactic Alliance forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Modifications"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the time, Lando's involvement with the mining operation known as Nomad City kept him from tinkering with the starship, but in the years since he repeatedly modified and upgraded Lady Luck."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lando initially planned to transform the Lady Luck into an advanced luxury cruiser. However, Calrissian's near-constant involvement with the New Republic forced him to convert the Lady Luck into a competent combat vehicle. At first glance, the fifty-meter-long starship appeared to be an unarmed pleasure yacht, but this placid exterior concealed five retractable laser cannons and a small ion cannon turret. A pair of powerful Chempat-6 deflector shield generators provided moderate protection from enemy fire. Lady Luck's engines were housed in two long engine pods connected to the main hull. Although the starship's sublight and hyperdrive speeds could not match those of the Millennium Falcon, the Lady Luck could still outrace nearly any other luxury vehicle in the galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lady Luck's secondary systems truly set it apart. It had a highly sophisticated sensor system allowing Lando to detect, identify, and scan approaching vessels at great range. When Lady Luck was scanned by customs officials or enemy forces, the ship's transponder could be programmed with up to three separate false identities that include aliases, fake cargo manifests, and modified system specs. Lando frequently changed these identities, although he used the alias Stardream on more than one occasion. A droid brain aboard the starship could pilot it in emergencies and direct it towards a beckon call that Lando always kept on his belt; this feature proved especially helpful when Lando, Luke Skywalker, and Han Solo were forced to flee the mining city of Ilic. The starship also had concealed smuggler compartments."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the Lady Luck was well-suited to combat, it was still a lavish luxury starship. An entire observation level included an exterior deck and numerous viewports. Lando's private suite and the five visitor cabins were decorated with rare art from around the galaxy. Conform-couches could be found throughout the starship, and the main deck contained a jet-stream meditation pool, and a small crystal garden."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
