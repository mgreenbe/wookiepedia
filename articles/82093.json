She later moved to Ostor and became one of the leaders of the Separatist group. When the Galactic Empire launched a military offensive to suppress the influence of the Separatists on Ostor, Starcourt and the other separatist leaders helped establish a defense strategy. This allowed the separatist general Atticus Farstar to almost completely wipe out a first wave of the empire. However, the defense did not stand up to a second wave of attacks.
