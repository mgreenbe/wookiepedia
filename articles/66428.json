The strike force was destroyed and the ships went into hyperspace. It was then an escort ship for Task Force Whirlwind. The Task Force was supposed to rendezvous with a convoy of Missile Boats that were used as bait to lure Zaarin's forces into a trap. However, Zaarin sent the Maelstrom to destroy the Task force but they were repelled. However, they managed to stall the task force long enough to be hopelessly behind schedule."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
