Removed from the rising skytowers of the planet-wide city, Unity Green symbolized the peace treaty between the Yuuzhan Vong and the Galactic Alliance. Yorik coral bluffs rose from the shores of Liberation Lake, while native hawk-bats preyed on bio-engineered yammal-jells and coufee eels. The council room at the top of the new Jedi Temple offered a spectacular view over Unity Green. Jedi Master Luke Skywalker was known to admire this vista before High Council sessions, and Chief of State Cal Omas considered it symbolic of his presidency."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
