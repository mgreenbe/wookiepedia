Arresting security members did not sit well with her squad, but the recruits had been in possession of blasters within the no-weapons area of the asteroid. The recruits demanded to speak to Nirama, but she ignored them, as every prisoner wants to see the boss, but he didn't want to see them. Less than an hour later, Nirama requested the prisoners be brought before him, and Mimb was a little embarrassed to have been proven wrong this once."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
