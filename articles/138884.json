Based on the larger TZ-2 transport, the TZ-24 was designed to serve as a rugged combat fighter for long campaigns in remote regions, and the ship's designers took pride in the simplicity and reliability of the design. It saw significant use by security forces, and thousands of the fighters were captured by the Sith Empire over the decades of war with the Galactic Republic; the Empire redesignated the fighter as the TZ-24 Gladiator. The TZ-24 was very similar to the Plug-6 heavy fighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TZ-24 Enforcer/Gladiator was introduced in the Digital Expansion Star Wars: The Old Republic: Galactic Starfighter, though it is virtually identical to a ship already identified as the Plug-6 heavy fighter in Star Wars: The Old Republic.
