Dack had been apprehended by Fondine for cheating, since he had entered an illegally-enhanced blob into a number of races in order to earn enough credits to buy passage offplanet in order to get away from the Duchess. Fondine had originally intended to execute him, but Lando Calrissian convinced him to return the fleeing Dack in order to avoid an intersystem incident. The track was, ironically, named for him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
