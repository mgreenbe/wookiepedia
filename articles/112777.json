Red commented on the entry for the d'skar, recommending that while the weapon was the easiest Ekkar Armaments to find off-world, the cost was usually four times the retail value. Red advised visiting the Ekkar Armaments site on Coyn and getting one directly from the manufacturer instead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Red also knew a contact based in the Corporate Sector who had a practical monopoly on black-powder pistols. The contact scavenged them from an old battle site and fitted the pieces together. Red also noted that every weapons collector had at least one black-powder pistol gathering dust in their collection. Commenting on the entry for the Imperial Munitions Heavy Blaster Pistol, Red noted that the weapon was going to be highly collectible due to it being the last product manufactured before the company went out of business."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
