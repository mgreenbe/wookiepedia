When the whole system adopted a policy of isolationism, Angratha followed suit. Eventually signing a treaty with the Galactic Senate, the sector was given a seat in the galactic political body, and accord all the rights as other members worlds. While talks of anti-slavery were strong under the Republic, upon the rise of the Galactic Empire they had dwindled. Angratha thrived under the Empire, supplying most of the region's frozen foods. Remaining independent after the Galactic Civil War, the sector was not attacked by the Yuuzhan Vong, accepting refugees inside its borders. As of 137 ABY, the world was enveloped by Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet Angratha was created for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game book Instant Adventures, published in 1996.
