Armed with missile batteries and the typical blue-beamed Chiss masers, she packed a powerful punch for a ship of her size. The missile launchers could also be used to deploy large shock nets, which could disable target vessels. A precisely-tuned hyperdrive enabled her to make tactical microjumps, and a powerful communications array allowed her to deploy electronic warfare techniques that could confound far more heavily-armed enemies.
