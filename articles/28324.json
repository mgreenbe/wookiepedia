It attempted to evacuate the Goff Platform. Realizing that the most serious danger to the craft evacuating the platform came from the Interdictor Compellor, it made its two starfighter squadrons Azul Squadron and Grez Squadron focus attacks on the Compellor. However, Avenger Squadron managed to destroy both squadrons down to the last starfighter. They then attacked the Colada and reduced its shields. The Imperial-class Star Destroyer Rage then demanded its surrender, a demand they refused, and as a result their ship was destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
