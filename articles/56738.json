But again, Blood continued to interfere by dispatching freelance Imperial mercenaries and later claimed that the Hunter died within the Dark Temple. Ultimately, the Hunter managed to win the final melee and became a Great Hunt competitor. Blood attempted to denounce the Hunter but the Huntmaster had already made his decision.
