At some stage in his life, Guerra was enslaved and sent to work in the mines of the planet Bandomeer. After three years in the mines Guerra met aspiring Jedi Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi and he managed to help Obi-Wan escape with the help of Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn. The two Jedi then managed to free Guerra and the rest of the mine workers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After these events Guerra stowed away on his brother Paxxi Derida's ship as Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan boarded on their way to Gala. Paxxi, however, dumped fuel in order to force a detour to the planet Phindar and have the Jedi help bring down the Syndicat. Eventually, Guerra and the other rebels alerted the other Phindians of the fake shortages and ultimately finished the Syndicat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mining on Bandomeer"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After over three years of work in the deep-sea mines, Guerra was assigned the task of outfitting the recently captured Obi-Wan Kenobi for work.

The next morning, when the guard's threw Obi-Wan overboard Guerra positioned a spun carbon tarp on the support struts of the platform. With the help of Qui-Gon Jinn, who had come to the deep-sea mines when as soon as he learned that Obi-Wan was imprisoned there, Obi-Wan landed on the tarp, and Guerra pulled him to safety. When Qui-Gon reached the pair, he deactivated the electro-collar that had been placed on Obi-Wan. However, before he could do the same for Guerra's, the two Jedi were forced to fight off more guards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the firefight, Guerra was grazed by blaster fire and he was forced to hide; Obi-Wan promised him that after reaching land he would find a way to deactivate the collars, Guerra noting that he trusted that Obi-Wan would keep his word.
