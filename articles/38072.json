Matt Cooper, an associate industrial designer at Coke, mentioned that the resulting project challenged his design team to \"take their brands places they've never taken them to,\" namely the Batuu setting. They intended to design the bottles to look as if they were pulled off a ship or left behind at Batuu and then repurposed, all while keeping to the aesthetics to the Star Wars franchise. This is not the first time Coca-Cola has partnered with Disney for one of its products. Coca-Cola was present in aiding Disney since the opening of Disneyland in 1955."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A bottle of Diet Coke appears as an easter egg in the 2020 web series Star Wars: Jedi Temple Challenge, a children's gameshow set in the Star Wars galaxy.
