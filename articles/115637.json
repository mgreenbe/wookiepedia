When the Gravestone piloted by Koth Vortena arrived to combat the Fleet, the freighter send a distress call, with SCORPIO impersonating its captain. Vortena allowed Ridala to land inside the Gravestone hangar for repairs, from where SCORPIO, Vaylin and a host of Knights of Zakuul and Horizon Guard rounded up Koth's crew and took control of the vessel. The Gravestone with Ridala still docked inside later traveled to Iokath system, where SCORPIO used it to travel to the surface of Iokath.
