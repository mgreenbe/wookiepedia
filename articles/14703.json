In retaliation for the joint Black Sun-Grappa the Hutt funded pirate raids on New Republic hyperspace routes during the crisis against the Interim Ruling Council, Red Leader commander Mirith Sinn led a multi-squadron raid on Black Sun's forces on Smarck, destroying their Spaarti cloning cylinders there and helping unravel the connection between the criminal forces and the Ruling Council. During the fighting, Commander Sinn was contacted by the force's base informing her that they had intercepted a transmission from Imperial channels. Upon learning that it concerned the whereabouts of Kir Kanos, Sinn's force broke off their attack and departed for an assault on Grappa's fortress on Genon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
