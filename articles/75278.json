Kenner acquired the license to produce Star Wars toys when the Mego Corporation rejected it in 1976[source?], and upon the success of the line, popularized the 3\u00be-inch scale, which became an industry standard that dominated the action figure toy market for years. In addition to producing action figures based on Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi, the toy company also produced more-stylized figures for the Droids and Ewoks cartoon series."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to their toy lines, they released games including the Star Wars: X-Wing Aces Target Game in 1977 and Star Wars: Electronic Battle Command in 1979."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After several changes of ownership, Kenner was purchased by the toy company Hasbro in mid-1991. Following a long hiatus, Hasbro relaunched its Star Wars line under the Kenner brand in 1995, with the release of a revived The Power of the Force collection. After that collection and other subsequent releases, the Kenner logo was finally replaced with Hasbro branding in 1999.
