A few of the moves were translated and described, however; Piercing Touch and Striking Mist. The former, Piercing Touch, was described as a powerful punch that was able to penetrate bone, chitin, and various armors. This move was demonstrated by Ooryl Qrygg when he punched a hole through stormtrooper armor while stationed on Talasea. The other move, Striking Mist, allowed the attacking Gand to sneak in close to their opponent, so that the hits could not be parried or dodged."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
