After the people of the planet Valahari took the side of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Republic was forced to establish blockades of neutral worlds that supplied military aid to the Separatists. An Aqualish Jedi was placed in charge of one such blockade, along with a fleet of Venator-class Star Destroyer and V-19 Torrent starfighters. Around 22 BBY, the Aqualish's forces were attacked by the Valahari ace pilot Tofen Vane and his squadron, Tofen's Raiders. The Jedi flew a Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor into battle, but was killed by Vane. The Jedi's fleet was also destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
