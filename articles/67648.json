Kershner agreed after Lucas told him he would concentrate on visual effects at the Skywalker Ranch and would leave directorial control to him; Kershner said Lucas told him it would be \"[his] picture.\" Kershner wanted to take The Empire Strikes Back in a more serious direction than the first film, although he did not want to stray too far from what Lucas described as the \"Saturday matinee, fun kind of film\" it had been. Kershner later described directing the film as \"one of the great experiences of my life.\" Kershner also had his funnier moments.
