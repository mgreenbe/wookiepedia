During the Clone Wars, both the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems utilized this type of siege weapon, while the Gungans, the Naboo, the Trade Federation, and the Wookiees of Kashyyyk did so in the years prior. During the Galactic Civil War, both the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic also used these vehicles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Air cruisers were a type of very large atmospheric, and occasionally spaceborne, combat repulsorcraft. Heavily armored and mounting a single large, siege-type weapon similar to a turbolaser, which caused significant damage to anything caught in its blast radius, these military vehicles were very slow and cumbersome."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While a group of them could lay waste to an enemy encampment, troop formation, or military base in relatively short order despite their slow rate of fire, they were extremely vulnerable to starfighters and other types of armed airspeeders. In addition, if air cruisers wandered too near, they could be shot down by air defense turrets or soldiers equipped with surface-to-air missiles despite their standard-issue shielding. Because of this, they were often escorted by smaller, swifter craft capable of dealing with potential airborne threats. Air cruisers utilized by the Gungans were actually mounted aquanna, a species of large, flying ray-type creature that was native to the wilds of Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known examples"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
