During this time, he took the Human Dendro as his Padawan. In 19 BBY, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine issued Order 66, mandating most clone troopers to murder their Jedi Generals. Shortly after, Palpatine declared himself Emperor of the new Galactic Empire. Hylon and Dendro survived the initial stages of the Great Jedi Purge and allied themselves with the Ovoni natives on the planet Otavon XII. A few months after Order 66 was issued, the Ovoni staged an assault on the local Imperial station, Tremor Base, which constructed All Terrain Armored Transports. The assault team was defeated, however, by the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader and Imperial forces under his command.

Hylon informed Vader that he had known that the Sith would use a mind trick on the sugati in order to reach the top of Mount Dijandi to confront Hylon. When Vader inquired as to where Hylon's starship was, the Jedi replied that there had never been a ship, and suggested that Vader be more concerned that the sugati was leaving. He then attacked Vader with his lightsaber while he was distracted.

Vader demanded Hylon tell him what his name was before the Dark Lord ended his life. The Jedi answered, stating that his name meant \"trickster\" in the Ovoni language. Vader further asked Hylon why he had come to the mountain without any hope of escape, and the Jedi replied that Vader would know when he went back to the Imperial base. The Dark Lord then used Dendro's lightsaber to kill Hylon, unaware that the Jedi Master had sacrificed himself by distracting Vader in order to ensure that the sugati would be able to destroy Tremor Base.
