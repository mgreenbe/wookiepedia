On the eve of the First Battle of Geonosis in 22 BBY, Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks convinced the Senate to increase the scope of the Chancellor's emergency powers, enabling Palpatine to bypass the Military Creation Act and form the Grand Army of the Republic. Four additional amendments were made to the Constitution throughout the war, further expanding Palpatine's emergency powers. One of them was the Reflex Amendment, which granted the Chancellor near-absolute power over military affairs, almost completely bypassing the Senate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unbeknownst to the Senate, Palpatine had deliberately engineered the Clone Wars so that he could remain in office and plot the downfall of the Jedi.
