As a more remote installation, DS 5 deployed aged Z-95 Headhunters, from Wolf Squadron but also mustered a group of B-wing fighters to intercept the encroaching Imperial scouts. Not long afterwards the Protector (the admiral's flagship) arrived and started launching its TIE Avengers. Stele, inspected the cargo containers near XQ1 Platform DS 5 to find water, Liquid gas, ground vehicles and grain. Following the reconnaissance of Harkov's logistical necessities Gunboats Mu proceeded to destroy the precious supplies. As ordered, the Assault Gunboats proceeded to leave the system upon the arrival of the Protector, easily motivated by the swift introduction of TIE Avengers from Protector's hangar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The destruction of the containers meant that the Rebels had to bring in more supplies to Harkov.
