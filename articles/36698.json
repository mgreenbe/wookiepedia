When Izal Garsea attempted to retrieve a package for Dok-Ondar that had mistakenly been sent to Ohnaka Transport Solutions, she was forced to stun Jeet. When Jeet woke, she searched the outpost for Garsea. The smuggler Ana Tolla used Jeet's dislike for Garsea to trick her into assisting them with a job that they claimed was sanctioned by Oga Garra.
