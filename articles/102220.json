The Overlord was badly damaged during an assault on the Republic border (an attack that was illegal under the terms of the Treaty of Coruscant) and became separated from its escorts. The ship attempted to hide in the upper atmosphere of Makem Te, but the Republic learned of the Overlord's presence and sent the elite Coruscant Aegis squadron to capture the ship. The squadron was able to cripple the Overlord so that the Republic forces could capture the warship and Moff Jocend himself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
