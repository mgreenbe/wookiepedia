Onith was one of the scene's booth-dwelling aliens whose masks were designed by makeup artist Rick Baker, created for supplemental shooting done during post-production when Lucas decided to liven the scene with more action and additional characters. Given the on-set nickname of Yam Nose, Onith was intended to receive the proper name of Yamnoss, but the idea never saw the light of day. However, a H'nemthe character in 1978's The Star Wars Holiday Special that re-used Onith's mask was eventually dubbed Yamnoss. Onith's mask was also re-used for a H'nemthe character that appeared in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Onith's name was established in 1995 with the release of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game's Premiere Limited set.
