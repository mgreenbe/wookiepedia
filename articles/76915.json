Eventually, the Rebel Alliance against the Empire sent a strike team to Endor, whose members befriended the Ewoks of Bright Tree Village and convinced them to join the fight. Princess Kneesaa participated in the ensuing Battle of Endor, helping rebel pathfinder Kes Dameron to coordinate complicated tactical maneuvers. They stayed with each other throughout the battle, communicating through verbal stresses and gestures.

The distressed princess Kneesaa and her friend Wicket enlisted the help of the Rebel heroes Commander Luke Skywalker and General Leia Organa to reset the tribe's Gorax traps, \ufeffwhich had been re-purposed for taking out the Imperial All Terrain Scout Transports during the Battle of Endor. Once they arrived at the location of the traps, the group immediately encountered the Gorax, and were forced to scatter. As the creature pushed Skywalker and Organa into a corner, Kneesaa and her friend managed to climb up a tree where one of the log traps was installed, and called Organa for help. Kneesaa threw the general her spear, which she used to cut a rope while Skywalker faced the giant, creating a diversion. Finally, Skywalker lured the Gorax right in front of the trap, and lend Organa his lightsaber. \ufeffWith the rope cut at last, the giant trunk swung into the predator, throwing it into a nearby swamp where it fell unsconscious. As Skywalker thanked Organa and retrieved his lightsaber, Princess Kneesaa and Wicket cheered, breaking into a happy dance."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Flying with the Ghost"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\ufeffIn the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Endor, Kneesaa and Tokkat also befriended Chopper, an old astromech droid that belonged to Rebel general Hera Syndulla, and the Ewoks attempted to teach the droid how to use a spear. However, the training session was interrupted when Syndulla came to inform the droid that the comm/scan of her starship, the Ghost, had picked up a couple stray Imperial TIE fighters heading for the Ewoks' village. Because they did not have time to gather any more crew members, Syndulla thought that only she and Chopper would have to do. The droid, however, brought Princess Kneesaa and her Tokkat aboard without his owner's knowledge. Although the general was disatisfied at first, Kneesaa and the other Ewok did wonders handling the ship's turrets, despite their small stature. Having proved their mettle in Syndulla's eyes, Kneesaa and her friend chattered excitedly as the Ghost took them home."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kneesaa's great bravery and leadership skills allowed her to succeed her father as chief of Bright Tree Village following the battle, becoming the tribe's first female chief."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kneesaa first appeared in the 2015 non-canon video game Disney Infinity 3.0.
