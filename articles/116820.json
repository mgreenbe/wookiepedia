It was released on December 16, 2016, the same day as the film itself. In addition to developing new themes and motifs such as the The Imperial Suite and the messenger motif, the film score incorporates leitmotifs from John Williams' Star Wars scores, particularly those from Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. The Rogue One soundtrack also makes extensive use of dies irae, which forms a significant part of Jyn Erso's theme."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the musical score does not begin with the \"Star Wars Main Title\" as with the Star Wars saga films, the Main Title is briefly played in the track \"Scrambling the Rebel Fleet,\" when C-3PO and R2-D2 appears on screen. A chorus is used for the tracks \"Your Father Would Be Proud\" and \"Hope,\" which plays in the film as its protagonists and other members of the Rebel Alliance meet their death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The soundtrack includes 21 tracks, which give a total runtime of over 69 minutes. The original soundtrack was published by Walt Disney Records on compact disc as well as vinyl record.
