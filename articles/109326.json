The duty of maintaining a peaceful coexistence between the Mon Calamari and Quarren was passed on to Kolina's son, Prince Lee-Char. During this time, the Quarren Isolation League, under Chieftain Nossor Ri, believed that the prince was inexperienced and demanded a Quarren king. At the same time, the Separatist Alliance ambassador, Commander Riff Tamson saw his opportunity to stir up the disagreements between the Mon Calamari and Quarren using it wisely. Noticing the anger on both sides, Mon Calamari Guard Captain Gial Ackbar requested that the Galactic Republic send Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala and her bodyguard, Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, to help mediate the dispute."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the Quarren refused the Republic's intervention and ended all chances of negotiations.

A deadly battle ensued, in which Quarren warriors were on the offensive. At last, Republic reinforcements arrived. As fights raged in seemingly every place imaginable, both sides suffered heavy casualties. Eventually, the Separatist and Quarren forces were forced to retreat. Shortly after, however, the Separatists unleashed deadly weapons that killed many Mon Calamari and clone troopers. Seeing their chance, the Quarren returned to attack with droids by their side. Gaining the upper hand, the Quarren were able to subdue many Mon Calamari and clones, who were later put into underwater prisons where they were forced to work as slaves. Gungan forces sent by the Republic soon arrived to turn the tide of the battle in favor of the Republic and Mon Calamari. However, Tamson ordered Trident-class assault ships to create a vortex to disable their enemies. This allowed nearly the entire force backed by the Republic to be shattered and captured, though Lee-Char and the Jedi had managed to escape.

After being brought before Tamson and Ri, Lee-Char pleaded with Ri to join the Mon Calamari against the Separatists, to which he received no response. The entire Republic force was brought out in chains to witness a public execution of the prince. During the planned killing, a Quarren warrior informed Ackbar that Ri and the Quarren had decided to ally themselves once again with the Mon Calamari, unbeknownst to Tamson. Ri then saved Lee-Char from an untimely death. By that time, the Quarren had armed their allies; the prisoners revolted, destroying the majority of the droids, though at least one Quarren warrior was shot dead during the ensuing conflict. Lee-Char and Tamson soon came face to face with each other, and Tamson revealed he had assassinated the former King, confirming that the popular belief, the Quarren murdering Kolina, to be false.

Negotiations between Lee-Char and Telvar did not go well, and, soon after Telvar boarded his shuttle to leave the planet, an explosion occurred, in which Telvar was killed. This resulted in the Empire attacking Dac City. At least two Quarren were killed during the initial attack, perishing while defending Mon Cala along with countless Mon Calamari. A massive tidal wave later swept the king away, caused by sea creatures he had unleashed upon the Empire's forces. Fortunately, King Lee-Char was soon found and rescued by two Quarren warriors. Shortly after this, a skirmish ensued in the waters of Mon Cala, where one Quarren was killed. Three warriors were visible blasting numerous stormtroopers dead in a corridor, while another shot enemies directly in Mon Cala's oceans. Later, at least three Quarren were present on Admiral Raddus's ship. After numerous clashes with the Empire, the majority of the Mon Cala force was finally crushed, though several ships, including at least one which had Quarren aboard, escaped the Imperial blockade of Mon Cala after King Lee-Char surrendered.
