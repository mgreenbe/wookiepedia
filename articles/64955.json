It was tough little unit and consisted of a disc with three projecting arms that could be twisted down to form a tripod stand."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It projected three-dimensional images formed by the interference of light beams and could carry up to one hundred minutes of projected images. The quality of the images was useful rather than outstanding and included the \"scan lines\" running through the image that were typical of holoprojectors of the time that the Imagecaster was released."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to being used as an independent image projector and recorder, the Imagecaster could also be coupled with the Hush-98 comlink also manufactured by SoroSuub, allowing its user carry a hologram transmission while simulating face to-face contact. The Imagecaster's casing ring had three curved tines that rotated downard, allowing the device to either link to larger image projector or stand on a surface level."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thanks to its sturdy construction, the Sorosuub Imagecaster was made for field use, and it was commonly used by members of the Jedi Order in the waning decades of the Galactic Republic. The Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn had one such device with him when he visited Tatooine during the Invasion of Naboo. Before proceeding to a junkyard where he hoped to obtain repair parts for a T-14 hyperdrive generator, Jinn loaded his Imagecaster with images of Queen Amidala's royal vessel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
