The god was awakened when a techno-totem displayed in the workshop was disturbed by an Imperial Delta-class T-3c shuttle that crashed through the wall of the laboratory. It then attacked the occupants of the shuttle and a team of mercenaries led by Doctor Chelli Aphra, who had been trying to loot the workshop. The god was killed when the mercenary droideka Dek-Nil caused the workshop's ceiling to collapse on the deity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
