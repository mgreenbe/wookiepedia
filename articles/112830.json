It participated in the Battle of Vahaba, attacking Admiral Teren Rogriss's Stellar Web along with Zsinj's Victory-class Star Destroyer Serpent's Smile. The attack failed due to mass fire and superior tactics on behalf of the temporarily allied New Republic and Galactic Empire, and Serpent's Smile was destroyed. Red Gauntlet surrendered shortly after, under the guns of General Han Solo's Crynyd and Skyhook, as well as Stellar Web. General Solo captured Red Gauntlet by putting a crew aboard her and discussed using her against Zsinj until she was reassigned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
