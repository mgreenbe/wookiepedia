During his service to the Order, the Jedi High Council dispatched Tan-Doov to Romin, a Mid Rim planet stricken with a grievous social class division. His mission was to locate and topple the regime of a local crime lord, but he was sidetracked when he encountered the Force-sensitive twins Eldewn and Elsae Sarvool. After convincing their parents to allow the twins to be taken to Coruscant for induction into the Order, Tan-Doov sent a preliminary report back to the Temple warning the High Council that he believed that the twins' power could become dangerous should they not receive proper training."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unable to finish his original mission, Tan-Doov loaded the twins aboard his ship and set coordinates back to Coruscant. During take-off, the ship was damaged when a concealed thermal detonator, installed by the crime lord the Jedi had once sought, exploded. Tan-Doov did not survive the explosion and the following crash, though the Sarvool twins did. Escaping the wreckage, they set out into the Romin undercity, hating both the Jedi and the crime lord who was responsible for altering their lives so drastically."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
