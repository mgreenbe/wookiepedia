It could detect movement up to 100 meters away by measuring the differences in air displacement and temperature with low-powered pulses every half-second. Any being detected by the scanner would show up on a flat screen display. The scanner could detect movement through most walls, although deflector shields and armor would often block the signal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
