The planet was believed to have been taken over by Vahl, a Force Adept who led her followers and was later deified by the cultists of the Ember of Vahl. The ancient Vahla were regarded as twisted and decadent, and several thousand years before the Sith\u2013Imperial War, the cult was decimated by the Jedi Knights in an attempt to quash their dark and destructive tendencies. Since then, the Vahla traveled the galaxy as nomads, searching endlessly for their lost homeworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
