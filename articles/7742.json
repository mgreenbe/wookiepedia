If an individual within whom a syrox was growing placed the snot garlic on his or her pillow before going to sleep, then the smell would draw the creature out through the mouth of the sufferer. For this reason, Waleed Nagma, a native of Monsolar, had a bulb of snot garlic smuggled into the prison Cog Hive Seven whilst he was an inmate there. Nagma, who had a syrox growing inside him, had fellow inmate Zero smuggle in the bulb with the prison's supplies. Nagma then used it as the folk remedy suggested, although the Monsolar native did so only as a last resort, initially attempting to have the parasite removed surgically. The syrox emerged from within Nagma while he was still awake and was then killed by Zero."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anzati snot garlic was used as an ingredient in Shaak pot roast, along with Shaak meat, space carrots, Ojomian onions, and Deltron spice wine. The dish was served for 8.7 at the Besalisk chef Dexter Jettster's eatery, Dex's Diner, on the planet of Coruscant. The diner prepared the dish by slow-cooking it in a Gamma flux boiler, and did so before the destruction of the establishment in around 19 BBY. The dish was also a favorite in the Lesser Plooriod Cluster throughout the Chommell sector, including the planet Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anzati snot garlic was first mentioned in the 2009 Hyperspace-exclusive article \"Dining at Dex's,\" which was written by Gregory Walker.
