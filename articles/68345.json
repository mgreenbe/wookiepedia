It was the sight of the chase involving Ahsoka Tano, Cassie Cryar, and Jedi Master Tera Sinube. The street was similar to many streets of Coruscant, with packed speeder traffic running through the levels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a chase, Ahsoka Tano pursued the thief Cassie Cryar to this street. After running along the top of a structure, Cryar released a weighted-plate and used it to descend to the news platforms below. As Cryar jumped from one platform to the next, Tano jumped down from the platform to follow. Cryar then cut the repulsorlift supports causing the platforms to collapse. Tano managed to keep up with all of the platforms until the final one when she jumped too late. As a result, J Street traffic was diverted all around the collapsing platforms while Tano clung to the face of Chancellor Palpatine on an announcement holofeed. As a result, Cryar managed to gain higher ground. Meanwhile, Cryar's partner Ione Marcy had almost been caught by Jedi Master Tera Sinube and Marcy was traveling in her airspeeder in order to escape the police. Cryar, who was scaling a pipe at the time, told her to meet her at the corner of J Street. Tano soon arrived and used the Force to tilt the pipe to a horizontal angle. While Tano tried to climb out to Cryar, who repeatedly jumped on the pipe, again diverting traffic on J Street. Soon afterwards, before Tano could apprehend her, Cryar jumped into the waiting Marcy's speeder and escaped to the train station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Ahsoka Tano is chasing Cassie Cryar, they jump over numerous floating advertising boards that feature Aurebesh writing.
