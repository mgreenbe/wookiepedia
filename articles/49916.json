At lowest setting, the spear would deliver excruciating electrical shocks, higher settings could result in paralysis and death, and at maximum setting, it could slice through everything from flesh and bone to thin durasteel plating. The weapon could be used for self defense, but also as a torture device. The Emperor's Royal Guards used the force pike mainly as a ceremonial weapon, but sometimes for other reasons; torture was one of them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite their name, force pikes were not related to the energy field known as the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Usage"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Force pikes were introduced in the Bengali Uprising. Sith assassins used force pikes during the Dark Wars to hunt Jedi across the galaxy. They were also utilized by Atris's Echani handmaidens. The Sith Lords used them during training exercises such as the one Darth Plagueis and Darth Sidious undertook on Kursid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Force pikes were powerful enough to withstand the blow of a lightsaber; the clone trooper X2 owned one during the Clone Wars, and his brother, X1, used it to execute Order 66 on Dantooine. Force pikes were generally used by Senate Guards and Imperial Royal Guards. The meter-long pike was used to keep any person away from important figures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While most prominently displayed by the Emperor's Royal Guards, who carried the popular SoroSuub Corporation Controller FP model, force pikes were employed by a wide variety of planetary militias and police forces, including Nirama's public asteroid security forces. They were excellent for crowd control. Force pikes were often employed during boarding actions because they allowed attackers to slice through bulkheads and airlocks and could be operated in small hallways."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Force pikes were used by Imperial stormtroopers during the beginning of the Galactic Civil War.
