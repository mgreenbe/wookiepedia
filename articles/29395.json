Like the Night Caller, its enlarged forward hold was modified to carry four TIE/LN starfighters. Along with the Nebulon-B frigate Provocateur and Night Caller, Constrictor was assigned to support Admiral Apwar Trigit's Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Implacable at the Battle of Talasea. Trigit realized at the last minute that he was heading into a trap and abandoned his support ships, and after taking severe damage from Wraith Squadron's attack, Constrictor surrendered to the New Republic forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
