In an effort to save weight and make the ship faster, all systems deemed \"extraneous\", including the ejection seat parachute, were removed from it. It was destroyed after Rucklin, in an attempt to gain any advantage, added stolen hyperfuel to the ship without knowing the safe amount to use. The ship was consequently turned into a \"flying bomb\", and exploded after a short time. Rucklin was only saved due to the daring efforts of Kazuda Xiono, who rescued him with the ejection seat at great danger to his own life. Rucklin was not grateful, as he had sunk all his savings into the ship, and ignored his own fault in the incident to blame Xiono, vowing to get him back for the loss of the racer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
