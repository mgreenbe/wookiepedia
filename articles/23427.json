At some point during the conflict, she and the bounty hunter Tendin Vought met with a droid, who sought to hire the pair to attack a star liner. Caranna was impressed by the way Vought negotiated with the droid, but she suspected that he planned to betray her, so she used a drug patch to incapacitate Vought. She then offered to complete the droid's job by herself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Caranna was attractive and talkative, and had a high-pitched voice.
