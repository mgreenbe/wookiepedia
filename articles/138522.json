Representing a shift in starfighter design from previous TIE models, the ship featured a hyperdrive as well as deflector shields to allow it to operate independently of Imperial capital ships. The ship's speed and agility, combined with its arsenal of four laser cannons, two ion cannons, two warhead launchers and an optional tractor beam projector made it arguably the most advanced starfighter available at the time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Zaarin's failed coup against Emperor Palpatine, the renegade admiral attempted to gain control of the TIE Defender technology to give his forces a technological advantage over the Empire. The advanced starfighter also attracted the attention of other factions, including the Rebel Alliance and pirate groups. Imperial forces under the command of Grand Admiral Thrawn were ultimately able to prevent the spread of the technology and the starfighter played a major role in Thrawn's successful campaign against Zaarin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Beyond the Zaarin campaign, the TIE Defender's high cost, together with political factors, kept it from achieving widespread use in the Empire and units were assigned only to the most elite pilots. The fighters participated in several other engagements during the Imperial era, including the Battle of Mygeeto and the Battle of Endor. Following the death of Emperor Palpatine at Endor, the TIE Defender continued to see limited use by Imperial forces. TIE Defenders saw action during Shadowspawn's campaign against the New Republic in 5 ABY and were used by the Republic's Rogue Squadron during a brief alliance with former Director of Imperial Intelligence Ysanne Isard against Prince-Admiral Delak Krennel's Ciutric Hegemony in 9 ABY. The fighters participated in multiple battles during the Yuuzhan Vong War and continued to be used by the Imperial Remnant until at least 44 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The high success rate of more advanced Rebel starfighters against standard Imperial TIE Fighters resulted in a mounting cost of replacing destroyed fighters. That, combined with the realization that the inclusion of a hyperdrive would allow the fleet to be more flexible, caused the Imperial Navy to rethink its doctrine of using swarms of cheap craft instead of fewer high-quality ones, leading to the introduction of the TIE Advanced x1 and its successor, the TIE Avenger. The TIE/D Defender, commonly known as the TIE Defender or T/D, was touted as the next \"logical advance\" of the TIE Series\u2014a starfighter that was fast, well armed and capable of hyperspace travel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sienar Fleet Systems followed specific Imperial instruction in developing the TIE Defender, among them the requirement that the fighter would exceed the mission capability of a flight group of four standard TIE Fighters. As such, it was equipped with a series of innovations over previous models. The practice of designing craft to explicit consumer specifications was one that Sienar would continue with the later Scimitar assault bomber and Aleph-class starfighter. The TIE Defender was 9.2 meters long."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Pilot module"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The pilot module was similar to those found in other TIE series fighters, with a ball cockpit and a hatch on the top for entry and egress. The module had room for a single pilot, 65 kilograms of cargo and consumables for up to one week. Like previous TIE models, the TIE Defender lacked life support systems and pilots were required to wear the standard sealed TIE pilot flight suit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In a departure from the design of previous TIE models, which typically had two parallel wings to either side of the pilot module, the TIE Defender had three quadanium steel solar array wings mounted around an aft section. The rear superstructure contained an I-s4d solar ionization reactor to store and convert solar energy collected from the wing panels. The distinctive triple-wing shape of the TIE Defender led Corran Horn to dub them \"trips,\" and the nickname was also adopted by other Rebel pilots. The wings themselves appeared similar to those found on the TIE Interceptor and TIE Avenger; unlike on its predecessors, the wings on the TIE Defender were angled out instead of in. The inclusion of a third wing provided additional solar power to increase the ship's range and the ship's energy management system was designed to allow weapons and shields to be charged with minimum loss of power to the propulsion system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One disadvantage of the design was an aft blind spot which could potentially be exploited by enemy fighters maneuverable enough to get behind the Defender and which was the cause of some frustration among pilots."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Propulsion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE Defender was one of the fastest starfighters in use during the Galactic Civil War. Although it was based on the standard twin ion engine design, it was upgraded to the entirely new P-sz9.7 twin ion engine, which was rated at 230 KTU and allowed it a maximum acceleration of 4,220 G or 21 MGLT/s and a top speed of 144 MGLT or 1,680 km/h in an atmosphere\u2014almost 40 percent faster than a standard TIE Fighter. With tractor beam recharge power redirected to the engines, the top speed could be increased to 180 MGLT. In addition to the main thrusters located in the aft section, the Defender's triple wing design allowed for three arrays of maneuvering jets\u2014which gave it a maneuverability rating of 110 DPF\u2014and it featured an advanced F-s5x flight avionics system to process the pilot's instructions. When combined, these systems made the ship not only faster, but more agile than any other starfighter in Imperial service and capable of matching the fastest starfighters in the Alliance Fleet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE Defender also featured a hyperdrive which allowed it to operate independently of capital ships. Testing of the original prototype indicated the need for a more powerful hyperdrive and production models included a class 2, ND9 hyperdrive motivator modified from the version developed for the TIE Avenger. The ship had a Sienar N-s6 Navcon navigation computer with a ten-jump memory."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Armament"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE Defender's weapons systems were designed to allow it to engage multiple enemy fighters as well as the armed freighters frequently used by the Alliance. It carried a formidable array of weaponry; in standard configuration it had four L-s9.3 laser cannons mounted on the two lower wings and two NK-3 ion cannons mounted on the upper wing. The laser and ion cannons could be set to fire separately or, if concentrated power was required, to fire-linked in either pairs or quartets. The ion cannons could even be fired simultaneously with the laser cannons. Two targeting sensors were located between each pair of cannons to provide the pilot with a constant stream of targeting information."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship also featured two M-g-2 general-purpose warhead launchers on the bottom of the pilot module, each of which could be equipped with a standard load of three proton torpedoes or four concussion missiles. Depending on the mission profile, the ship could be fitted with alternative warheads such as proton rockets, proton bombs, or magnetic pulse warheads. The inclusion of warhead launchers in the design was considered audacious by some members of the design team."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The small tractor beam projector developed for the TIE Avenger could be easily fitted to the Defender. The tractor beam had limited range and could only be used for a short time before stopping to recharge, but it allowed the pilot to temporarily inhibit the mobility of enemy fighters, making it easier to target them with the ship's other weapon systems. Models produced by Ysanne Isard's Defender production facility regularly carried such tractor beams and the technology found other uses, such as allowing TIE Defenders to tow damaged starfighters until they could achieve the required velocity to enter hyperspace. Corran Horn discovered that by using the beam to target a large object, he could effectively use it as an anchor, allowing the TIE Defender to achieve a tighter turning circle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship's defenses were provided by a pair of forward and rear projecting Novaldex deflector shield generators\u2014another advantage over standard TIE models. The shields were designed to recharge more rapidly than in previous Imperial fighters and were nearly as powerful as those found on capital ships, with a total rating of 100 SBD. The fighters were not equipped with particle shields, relying on the reinforced titanium hull to absorb impacts from matter. Its hull and wings were the strongest of any TIE series starfighter and were rated at 14 RU."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Systems"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As with other TIE series fighters, the TIE Defender used a wheel and yoke control system. Pulling back would cause the ship to climb, pushing forward would cause it to dive and the ship could be made to bank and turn by twisting the controls. Grips on either side had the weapons trigger switches while an array of buttons and switches in the middle controlled other functions, including throttle, weapons selection and target acquisition. Manipulating rudder pedals caused maneuvering planes to expand or contract to angle engine thrust and quickly alter the ship's trajectory. The ship featured an auto-landing function to plot entry vector and landing speed, although the pilot could retain manual control if they preferred. When not in use, the ship could be left in a password controlled standby mode to prevent unauthorized use."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Various display panels inside the cockpit allowed the pilot to monitor ship's systems and the surrounding area. The main Combat Multi-view Display displayed sensor data on targeted ships while additional monitors displayed short range sensor contacts. Additional panels displayed the remaining charge of weapons, shields and tractor beam systems, current warhead load and power usage. A chronometer was used to display the mission time, or during hyperspace travel to countdown to reversion to realspace. A heads-up display assisted the pilot in aiming the ship's weapons and displayed data from the ship's threat warning system. Like other TIE series starfighters, TIE Defenders were mounted on racks in the hangar when carried aboard a capital ship."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cost"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE Defender was in many ways far superior to any other starfighter of the time, capable of outperforming the majority of Rebel starfighters with its combination of firepower, speed, and maneuverability. The sophisticated features of the TIE Defender had two major implications: firstly the inclusion of the hyperdrive, shields, and reinforced armor made the ship heavier than any of its predecessors\u2014a fact which made its speed and maneuverability all the more impressive. Secondly and more importantly, the ship was very expensive, with each unit costing 300,000 credits\u2014more than five times the cost of a standard TIE fighter\u2014or 80,000 credits used. High maintenance and training costs added further to the expense of the fighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE Defender was designed to serve as a multi-role starfighter, capable and durable enough to take on a variety of missions. Standard Imperial doctrine recommended that TIE Defenders operate in flight groups of four; however, Imperial commanders took advantage of the starfighter's superior abilities to customize mission forces on a case-by-case basis. Defender pilots often found themselves occupying mission roles previously held by older fighters such as TIE Interceptors and Assault Gunboats."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE Defender's weaponry and deflector shields made it an ideal space superiority fighter, capable of engaging multiple enemies at once. The craft possessed impressive speed promoting its function as a superior interceptor, capable of eliminating incoming starfighters before they posed a threat to Imperial capital ships. Pound for pound each TIE Defender matched or exceeded all Rebel starfighters in speed, armament, defenses, and maneuverability, proving a worthy adversary against even Imperial forces. Their effectiveness against Rebel forces earned them the nickname \"X-wing Killers\" among TIE Defender pilots and crew."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their hyperdrives allowed TIE Defenders to conduct patrols across large areas of space without support from capital ships. The versatility of the TIE Defender allowed a large degree of flexibility in its use, as even a single craft could prove formidable, able to outrun or outgun enemy fighters. While on recon missions, Defenders could also bring heavy ordnance to bear on enemy capital ships. Upon the discovery of Grand Admiral Zaarin's plot against Emperor Palpatine, the Sith Lord Darth Vader employed the TIE Defender's abilities in that role, breaking through Zaarin's lines to reach the planet Coruscant. Lord Vader's flight group destroyed the Immobilizer 418 cruiser Harpago, which was attempting to block his imperative voyage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE Defender's ion cannons paired with the ability to carry multiple warhead types allowed it to function as an effective light bomber or assault fighter. TIE Defenders often assumed missions to disable or destroy enemy installations or capital ships, at times by a single flight group or with only Gamma-class ATR-6 assault transports as support. Defender squadrons could combine their firepower to eliminate a target as large as Alliance Space Stations, while still covering the starfighter interception role."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Training"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Opportunities to train on the TIE Defender were limited, only high-ranking ace TIE Interceptor pilots who had survived at least twenty combat missions, and whose loyalty to the Empire was undisputed, were selected, ensuring that only the best pilots flew the advanced starfighter. During the Galactic Civil War, Imperial pilots were required to gain a training certificate by flying the TIE Defender through an enclosed training course before proceeding to simulated combat missions. The training course consisted of a cylindrical loop containing targets and obstacles for pilots to traverse. Defender pilots raced against the clock to navigate the course, destroying targets when at all possible to gain bonus time. Having received a training certificate, Defender pilots could move onto the combat scenarios, some of which were based on historical sorties, designed to familiarize the pilot with the controls and handling of the starfighter before they entered actual combat. If the pilot successfully completed all four training missions, they received the gold TIE Defender combat medallion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the later years of the Empire, less rigid training regimes were in use. When Rogue Squadron trained on the TIE Defender against Imperial forces commanded by Ysanne Isard, they engaged the Imperials in a series of mock battles including a recreation of an Imperial attack on Rogue Squadron's former base at Yag-prime."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Combat scenarios"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first combat training exercise tested the pilot's ability to dogfight against a variety of Rebel starfighters and allowed them to customize the difficulty of the mission by controlling the number and skill of opponents, to a maximum of 250 potential kills. For a greater challenge, the pilot could choose to face enemy TIE Defenders. Defender pilots began the simulation stationary, surrounded by five cargo containers. Upon inspection of named containers, for example \"Y-wing,\" individual starfighters entered the system at increasing difficulties, five in all. Defender pilots could increase the challenge by attacking the container, sending in all difficulty levels at one time. In the event that the pilot could not handle the increased demands of the mission, destroying the container resulted in the spacecraft derived from the inspection entering hyperspace. Another control level installed consisted of enemy fighters responding to the trainee's orders; pilots could instruct enemy fighters to wait or head for home in the event the challenge grew too great."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to test the pilot's ability to make effective use of a tractor beam, the second combat exercise challenged them to prevent the escape of Rebel spy from a salvage yard near Venzeiia 2 Prime. In a recreation of a mission led by the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Glory, the pilot had to snare a spy's YT-1300 light freighter in order to disable it for capture by Imperial forces, and then assist in the capture of the yard itself. The pilot arrived in the system to find three Corellian transports aboard the station. With multiple transports, some fleeing from the arrival of Imperial forces, pilots had to move quickly to disable all transports and locate the spy. Rebel A-wings added to trainee frustration by acquiring missile locks as trainees scrambled to stop fleeing transports. After disabling all three transports, trainees had completed the primary objective, but could continue to aid in the capture of the platform, protect Imperial boarding craft, disable a Rebel B-wing, and destroy any other Rebel sympathizer craft in the area."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The third combat exercise demonstrated the ship's ability to operate independent of capital ships by inspecting vessels passing through a hyperspace jump point and disabling any vessels carrying contraband for capture by Imperial forces. After entering the system, pilots waited as cargo craft began passing through the sector, starting with Modular conveyors. Cargo ferries soon followed, one of which contained Rebels. Pilots could disable the craft for capture immediately upon the discovery, or wait until after inspecting the remaining transports, completing the primary objective. After disabling the contraband-carrying cargo ferry, trainees fended off multiple series of Rebel starfighters, protecting their command ship and boarding craft. All secondary and bonus objectives could be completed by eliminating all non-Imperial craft in the system, and successfully capturing the contraband."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a final test of the trainee's abilities, the pilot learned to use the TIE Defender as a light bomber to attack capital ships, using warheads to quickly eliminate their shields and ion cannons to disable them for capture. Armed with proton bombs, trainees arrived in system to discover two Rebel Ton-Falk-class escort carriers loaded with starfighters, however the primary objective only dictated the necessity of capturing one carrier. Despite the heavy payload, pilots used their wing mates to strategically assault at least one carrier by eliminating its weapon emplacements, being unable to completely lower the carrier's shields with projectile ordnance. Once the carrier was disabled, trainees had completed their primary objective, and were able to continue with secondary and bonus goals of destroying an enemy frigate, corvettes, and various Rebel starfighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early development"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Empire's loss at the Battle of Yavin forced it to reconsider its tactics in fighting the Rebellion. Several new weapons projects were initiated as a result, among them the TIE Defender. Such was the importance of the TIE Defender that the top secret development project was conducted under the supervision of top naval commanders, including Grand Admiral Demetrius Zaarin, then head of research and development for starfighter technology, and the project would see several prototype stages before its completion shortly before the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The initial prototype for the TIE Defender was the TIE/Ad x7, developed at the Sienar Advanced Research Division on Corulag with input from Zaarin. Although the tri-wing design of the ship was in place for the initial prototype, the ship was intended only as a test bed for the drive and targeting systems; it did not have the final ion engines and lacked the hyperdrive, ion cannons, and missile launchers which were incorporated into later prototypes and the final design."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In early 3 ABY, the Empire launched a massive assault on the Rebel base on Hoth. As the main Rebel forces struggled to delay the Imperials, the Alliance's Renegade Squadron destroyed the weaponry on two Victory II-class frigates as they attempted to escape. The Imperials decided to test out the TIE Advanced x7 prototypes and dispatched a unit of the vessels to join the fight. However, the early models lacked the speed of the final version and, although they now included missile launchers, the ion cannons were still absent. Six of the TIE Advanced x7 prototypes were destroyed by Renegade Squadron who also managed to board a Star Destroyer and steal one of the fighters to be studied by Alliance High Command. The Empire dismissed the theft as unimportant since the prototype lacked most of the systems planned for later models and, despite the prototypes' failure against the Rebels, the data collected during the battle proved useful to Sienar Fleet System's technicians in further developing the fighter."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Final development and testing"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Battle of Hoth, Emperor Palpatine charged Grand Admiral Zaarin with the continuing development of the TIE series. Zaarin had all ongoing projects transferred to the XQ6 Platform Research in the Parmel system, including the TIE Defender and TIE Avenger, an evolution of Darth Vader's TIE Advanced x1 which Zaarin saw as merely a step towards completion of the TIE Defender. Both projects relied heavily upon the development of a hyperdrive which could be mass produced and which would be small enough to fit inside the fuselage of a TIE fighter. When that proved problematic to Zaarin's team, the Grand Admiral managed to acquire the technology from the Habeen through a combination of diplomacy and military action against their rivals, the Nharwaak. By the time that the TIE Avenger, modified by Zaarin to use the Habeen hyperdrive technology, entered service, the TIE Defender project had reached the final prototype stage and the Empire was planning to roll the finished product out as a replacement for the Assault Gunboat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the final prototypes were ready for inspection, Darth Vader instructed Zaarin to have six of the new fighters delivered to Emperor Palpatine on Coruscant for his personal review.

The ship received an icy reception from those in the Imperial hierarchy. Many in the Imperial Navy who had not been privy to the starfighter's development were surprised by its sudden introduction. Some resented the ship due to a feeling that Zaarin had gathered too much power and prestige, while others saw the fact that the ship did not fit in with the traditional tactics of the Imperial Navy as an admission of failure, leading to some resentment towards the ship, and the commanders that used them in battle. Such was the level of resentment toward the ship that, had certain elements of the Imperial Navy known of its secret development, it is likely the project would have been abandoned before completion. In the end, the field tests were never extensive and this, together with the prohibitive cost, meant that even an organization as wealthy as the Imperial Navy chose not to mass-deploy such a fighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some of the fighters were used to protect the TIE Experimental Project, another starfighter development project with which Zaarin was heavily involved.
