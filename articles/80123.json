The Human residents of the ecumenopolis were speciest, and it was illegal for non-Humans to live in the Upper City. Despite this, Larrim, along with several other illegal aliens, lived in the Upper City's South Apartments, as they were the only ones who would rent in such a run down location. The authorities found it to be too much trouble, and did not persecute the aliens living there. He operated a small kiosk where he sold medpacs, armor suits, swords, blasters, grenades, mines, and a rare, expensive, and hi-tech personal energy shield."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Jedi Civil War, Taris was occupied by the Sith Empire. In 3956 BBY, following a battle overhead, several escape pods belonging to the Galactic Republic crashed down on the planet. One of these pods contained Bastila Shan, a Jedi Padawan who's battle meditation was a key part to the Republic war effort. Attempting to trap her on the planet, the Sith declared martial law and placed Taris under quarantine. The new rulers vowed to uphold the Tarisians' traditions, but ended up relaxing the laws regarding aliens. Several days after the battle, former Sith Lord Revan, with the personality of a Republic soldier, and soldier Carth Onasi were taking refuge in the South Apartments."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Larrim, at his kiosk, approached the pair when they walked by. He introduced himself to Revan, who reciprocated the gesture. Revan asked about his kiosk and the illegal aliens. Larrim gladly assisted Revan with these matters, and was willing to barter with him.
