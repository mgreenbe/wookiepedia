Serving the Order throughout the Clone Wars, a bloody conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Jedi Yelgo was able to survive the war and the traitorous betrayal of the Order by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Palpatine, indeed the mysterious Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, issued Contingency Order 66 to the troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic, ordering them to slay their Jedi allies. While Yelgo's role in the war remains ambiguous, he was able to avoid slaughter by the minions of the newly formed Galactic Empire and escape into hiding as Emperor Palpatine reorganized the ruins of the Republic and disbanded the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Added to a list of fugitives wanted by the Empire, Yelgo was tracked down by Imperial agents to the Coth Fuuras space station. Assigned to kill Yelgo was Imperial commando Squad 40 of the 501st Legion; the three clones devised a plan to limit civilian casualties on the station by setting off a fire alarm that would necessitate the evacuation of the station. As the throng of civilians passed beyond a disguised checkpoint, the squad caught sight of Yelgo, distinctive for his broken nose and freckles. As the ambush unfolded, Yelgo attempted to escape but was not fast enough to make it through the fire doors before they shut. Trapped, Yelgo was resigned to die fighting and drew his lightsaber and engaged the squad. Deflecting blaster bolts, Yelgo concentrated on a transparisteel wall and used the Force to bring it down upon himself and the squad. Before he was able to shatter the wall completely, Yelgo was caught off guard by commando Rede, who blasted through the wall and caused it to shatter prematurely. As the wall exploded over Yelgo's head, Rede raced in and stabbed him in the gut. Stunned, Yelgo collapsed to his knees where Rede shot him twice in the head."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
