Instead of fighting, the droid recommends that the Jedi flee, as well. Picking a safe vantage point atop a large tree, the two Jedi leap to apparent safety. They are almost unnoticed when a large creature turns around and begins headbutting the tree. The Jedi flee and are soon safely across a ravine...only to find themselves trapped with an even larger beast. Before they can be consumed by this monstrosity, a large raptor picks them up, taking them to its nest. Flying over the sea, a large sea creature ascends out of the water to devour the bird. Skywalker and Kenobi escape from the talons and drop into the ocean, where Kenobi is promptly seized by a large clam-like creature with tentacles. Skywalker ignites his lightsaber and rescues his former Master, dragging him onto shore. The two are once again confronted by a creature\u2014a small yet ferocious crab which Kenobi quickly steps on. Finally able to catch their breath, the Jedi jump in shock when the same battle droid runs across the beach, warning them once again to run."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Creature Comfort\" is misspelled \"Creature Comforts\" in the table of contents of Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures Volume 7."}]}
