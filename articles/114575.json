Revan\u2014at the time of the attack was unaware of his history as former Dark Lord of the Sith\u2014was also stationed on the vessel as a common soldier. During the attack, Shan's lifepod vanished somewhere on the surface of Taris. After crashing in the Tarisian Upper City themselves\u2014and knowing the importance of Shan to the Republic war effort\u2014Revan and Onasi sought to find her. Eventually, the pair traveled into the Lower City, where they met the young Twi'lek Mission Vao, and her partner, the Wookiee Zaalbar. Through this encounter, Revan and Onasi were directed to the Hidden Bek Base and spoke with the leader of the Hidden Beks swoop gang, Gadon Thek. Thek informed the pair that Shan had been captured by the Black Vulkars, a rival swoop gang led by Brejik, and was being held as prisoner.

She agreed to assist Revan if Zaalbar, who had been recently captured, could be rescued from Gamorrean slavers. Revan agreed to the barter, and the trio proceeded into the sewers. After freeing Zaalbar, Vao helped Revan get into the Black Vulkar base, where the party found the prototype accelerator, but a firefight ensued to acquire it. Successful, the party returned the engine to Gadon Thek and Revan was allowed to compete in the Season Opener.

Ordo told Revan to acquire T3-M4 from Janice Nall at his request and, with the droid's help, Revan broke into the base and stole the launch codes after a duel with the Force-sensitive Sith Governor. With the codes in hand, Revan and Ordo proceeded to the estate of crime lord Davik Kang to steal his flagship, the Ebon Hawk.

Eventually, the Dark Lord of the Sith tracked the young Jedi aboard the Republic Navy's Hammerhead-class cruiser Endar Spire, which she commanded. An attack was launched against the vessel over the planet Taris in an attempt to capture the Jedi, but Shan managed to escape the Endar Spire. The lifepods that were jettisoned from the ship, one of which contained Shan, crashed onto the surface of Taris\u2014many falling deep into the Tarisian Undercity.

Revan's and Onasi's presence, coupled with Ixgil's remarks, caused a scuffle to ensue. During the fight, Ixgil was killed by blaster fire. Revan and Onasi then preceded to defend the other Duros landlord, killing the inspection team. The leaser was grateful and said that he would hide the bodies before other Sith teams arrived.

After Revan and Onasi defended the Aqualish by defeating the Sith investigators, it came to light that the dealer had been in the process of acquiring Sith armor on behalf of the Hidden Beks, a Lower City swoop gang, so that the Beks could move between levels about without being stopped. The Aqualish was unable to provide Revan with armor, but encouraged him to steal from the bodies of the deceased inspectors.

Among the regular patrons that Revan and Onasi encountered was Mission Vao, a Rutian Twi'lek and native of Taris, and her partner, the Wookiee Zaalbar. The bubbly Twi'lek viewed herself as Revan's and Onasi's \"welcome party\" to Taris, and proceeded to answer all of their questions.

Thek revealed that she had been captured by the Black Vulkars and had been placed as the prize in the annual season-opening swoop race by their leader, Brejik. In order to rescue Shan, Thek surmised, Revan would have to win the swoop race and claim his prize. Thek offered Revan the chance to run in the race on behalf of, and sponsored by, the Hidden Beks, if he could retrieve a prototype accelerator that had been stolen by Vulkar gang members. Access to the Black Vulkar Base was restricted and the only way in was through the Undercity sewers. Thek suggested that Mission Vao lead Revan through the sewers, stating that she knew every inch of them better than anyone else. Vao and Zaalbar, however, had just recently left to do more exploring in the Undercity. Thek suggested that Revan and Onasi catch up with them there. Access to the Undercity was restricted to all individuals unless they had the proper security papers. Unlike the guard in the Upper City, a simple disguise was not sufficient to gain them access. In an exchange, Thek gave Revan the proper security papers that had been swiped from a Sith patrol in exchange for the Sith armor that he used initially.

The Outcasts, according to Gendar, were the descendants of those who were exiled from the Upper City for crimes against the people. They were plagued by the rakghouls and other marauders such as swoop gang members from the Lower City who came through to scavenge remains. They were kept safe from the rakghouls by a large gate on the northeast side of their village. Revan then asked Gendar if he knew of Mission Vao.

Zaalbar had been captured by Gamorrean slavers, but Vao had escaped.

With Revan as a participant, the gang leader decided to protect his regular racers from possible injury and have Revan race with the prototype in his swoop bike. After a night of rest, Revan was taken to the track to register. Upon meeting with the registrar and his mechanic, Revan began learning how to run a swoop. He picked up the skill quickly, however, and had a successful first run. His time was not the fastest, having been surpassed by the heralded Black Vulkar Redros, and he had to compete again.

Ordo requested that Revan meet him in Javyar's Cantina, for he had an offer that Revan \"couldn't refuse.\" Revan traveled to the Lower City cantina and met with the mercenary. Impressed with Revan's victory in the Season Opener and the ensuing skirmish, the Mandalorian thought the soldier was a perfect fit for his own goal of fleeing Taris. Ordo said that he could provide a ship to leave the planet if Revan could provide the blockade codes from the Sith Military Base. Due to the blockade of Taris, any vessel without the proper clearance codes would not be allowed to leave the Tarisian system. According to the mercenary, once the codes were brought to him, Revan and his team would be able to use the flagship of crime lord Davik Kang, the Ebon Hawk, as a means of escaping the planet. Further explaining the plan, Ordo mentioned that the Sith Base had a special security system that would require an astromech droid to unlock and open.

Throughout the base, sentry droids prowled the corridors and Sith soldiers filled the rooms. In one of the scuffles, Revan acquired a Sith ID passcard. A challenging obstacle, however, was stationed in the elevator entranceway. There, a security droid with a formidable shield was stationed.
