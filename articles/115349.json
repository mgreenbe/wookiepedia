Reytha's governor, Antes Belladar, was considered by Imperial Intelligence to be either soft or a traitor, and the Rebels were able to establish bases on the Montrosa Islands, as well as at Reytha Minor. Bandits took over the the Food Storage facilities at Breeda, and Page's Commandos attacked the city of Teks. The incursions grew to the point that Governor Belladar was forced to call in reinforcements. The Sith Lord Darth Vader arrived with a strike force on a Lambda-class shuttle. His forces consisted of 2 Viper probe droids, 3 Light All Terrain Personal Transports, 2 Heavy Dewback troopers, 12 Stormtroopers, and a 2-1C medical droid. The campaign was part of the Rebel strategy to distract the Imperial Navy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rooting out the cities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Vader ordered his troops to go to the abandoned base at Yeere, with the probe droids scouting ahead. The base was reactivated, and the Imperial forces started fighting back against the Rebels.

Although initially underestimating the size of the Rebel base in Reytha Minor, Darth Vader led his forces in destroying its command center."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the campaign went on, Darth Vader's frustration with Belladar grew, and with suspicions about the Governor's true allegiance, Vader finally had enough and killed Belladar with a Force choke."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Montrosa Islands"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Vader then ordered all Imperial forces on Reytha to converge at the Montrosa Islands.

In the first mission, retaking Teks and Breeda is an optional objective, although this article assumes the player did so. Page's Commandos appear during the first battle despite the fact that the unit was formed almost 5 years later. Mara Jade can be spotted on the game map during the first Reytha mission.
