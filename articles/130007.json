The squad was led by Dek-Nil, a droideka reprogrammed by Doctor Chelli Aphra, who had been used as a hubdroid after being sent to the prison. During an attack on an EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate, Dek-Nil arranged for the deaths of all the prisoners in his squad so he could save Aphra's proximity bomb to himself, also saving Lopset Yas in the process."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
