Chokk was later identified in Star Wars: Episode I The Visual Dictionary as one of Jabba Desilijic Tiure's bodyguards during the Boonta Eve Classic. However, this depiction was contradicted by Star Wars Customizable Card Game and the Young Jedi Collectible Card Game, both of which were released in 2001. While the respective Card Games used an image of a Klatooinian in a red tunic, the Visual Guide's uses an image portraying Chokk as an armed guard standing near the Hutt that is clearly contradictory to the Card Games' images. He was portrayed by Bill Tlusty."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
