Its mesh design was capable of absorbing a remarkable amount of kinetic force. This combat suit was extremely flexible, and provided a wide range of movement, unlike the heavier armor usually worn by the Mandalorians. It was not blaster proof, but protected the wearer from small amounts of heat. It had pockets for rations and cable launchers but came with no utility belt.\nIt was still in use during the Dark Wars, at which time most merchants valued it at 850 Republic Credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
