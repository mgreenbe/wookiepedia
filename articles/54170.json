He scavenged the remains and leftover debris from battles for items he could sell to either of the two fighting factions, the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Galactic Republic. Although Nachkt was not allied with either organization in the war, he dealt with the Confederacy on numerous occasions, working with Wat Tambor, a member of the Separatist Council\u2014the legislative branch of the Confederacy. Anticipating that an adversary of his, the Koorivar Passel Argente, was planning on buying a spy droid from Nachkt, Tambor hired the Trandoshan to instead sell Argente a spy droid planted by Tambor. After the Battle of Bothawui, he found R2-D2, an astromech droid belonging to the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, and resolved to sell the droid to the Confederate General Grievous."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Argente arrived on the Vulture's Claw to buy a droid to spy on Tambor, Nachkt sold Tambor's planted droid to Argente, receiving credits from both parties. When Skywalker and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, saw the Vulture's Claw on the battlefield, they came on board to search for R2-D2. The scavenger hid the droid from them and claimed that he had not found any astromech droids in the wake of the battle. After Skywalker and Tano left, Nachkt traveled to the Separatist listening post Skytop Station to give the droid to Grievous. When the Trandoshan arrived at the station, he was instructed by Grievous to take the droid apart and extract whatever information the droid carried. Nachkt, however, found that R2-D2 contained more important information than he had originally thought, and demanded more payment from Grievous. In retribution, Grievous stabbed Nachkt with his lightsaber, instantly killing the Trandoshan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Scavenger"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gha Nachkt was a Trandoshan scavenger from the planet Trandosha and a level five droid programmer who lived during the Clone Wars, scavenging the debris left over after battles for items he could sell. Nachkt was not allied with the Republic or Confederacy of Independent Systems during the war, and was more concerned about how many credits he could gain. Due to this, he sold his salvage to the highest bidder. In his GS-100 salvage ship, the Vulture's Claw, Nachkt searched the debris left over from battles for any merchandise he could sell. He had a number of droids, including several IG-86 sentinel droids, aboard his vessel, scavenged from across the galaxy. His right eye was injured in a fight that he started in a Coruscant cantina, causing his face to become permanently asymmetrical."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, Nachkt visited the restaurant Dex's Diner, on the planet Coruscant. While he was there, he overheard an Iktotchi talking about a recent attack on the Galactic Senate, and later spotted a Jedi Padawan, who had came to the diner to speak to Dexter Jettster, the restaurant's owner. Nachkt offered to help the Padawan in return for some credits, and the Padawan accepted, then asked Nachkt if he knew anything about the attack on the Senate. The Trandoshan advised the Padawan to go and speak to Koro Ferbin, an information broker who resided in the Outlander Club, a Coruscant gambling institution."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the war, Nachkt provided transport for the Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress to the planet Tatooine, where she met with the Separatist Captain Mar Tuuk and proceeded to the planet Cato Neimoidia with him. A Jedi Knight later found Nachkt while searching for information on Ventress, and after learning about Nachkt's actions, the Jedi Knight proceeded to Cato Neimoidia to question Tuuk. When Tuuk hired Nachkt to smuggle shaaks from their Naboo herds to Tatooine as part of a smuggling ring under the Hutt crime lord Ziro Desilijic Tiure, Nachkt was intercepted at a Rodian spaceport by the same Jedi Knight. After disabling the Vulture's Claw and boarding it to retrieve the stolen shaaks, the same Jedi Knight whom Nachkt had just dealt with confronted the Trandoshan smuggler, who revealed that he had been hired by Tuuk. While investigating thefts of several Republic military vehicles, the Jedi Knight again encountered Nachkt on Tatooine and questioned him about the thefts. Not willing to cooperate with the Jedi's questioning, Nachkt escaped aboard the Vulture's Claw, though the ship crashed in the Dune Sea of Tatooine. There, the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka and his gang of pirates attacked Nachkt and the Jedi, though Nachkt was able to escape during the firefight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point afterward, the scavenger was approached by Wat Tambor, the Foreman of the Techno Union, who offered to pay him to sell a spy droid to Magistrate Passel Argente of the Corporate Alliance, an adversary of Tambor's. Argente would have no idea of the droid's true programming, and so the droid would be able to spy on Argente and report back on his dealings to the Foreman. The Trandoshan agreed to the offer, and Tambor gave him the protocol droid that was to be sold to Argente."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Salvaging an astromech droid"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Republic's defense of the planet Bothawui, Jedi General Anakin Skywalker lost his astromech droid, R2-D2. The astromech contained information on Republic battle plans, formations, and bases that would be an asset to the Confederacy. Nachkt, on a search for debris he could sell after the battle, discovered R2-D2 and brought the droid aboard the Vulture's Claw. Inside, Nachkt discovered the information the astromech droid contained, and decided to sell it to the Confederate Supreme Commander, General Grievous."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, searched the asteroid belt for the lost astromech. When the two Jedi came aboard the Vulture's Claw, Nachkt hid Skywalker's droid, instead escorting the Jedi to another area of the ship. Skywalker and Tano searched the ship, but instead of finding R2-D2, they confronted two of Nachkt's sentinel droids and destroyed them. The Jedi left the ship, believing that the droid was not on board, and Nachkt was displeased with the damages the Jedi had caused. Nachkt contacted General Grievous and agreed to transfer R2-D2 at the general's Separatist listening post, Skytop Station, and collect his payment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Skywalker and Tano had departed from the ship, Magistrate Argente arrived aboard the Vulture's Claw. Argente bribed Nachkt with credits to keep the details of their meeting private. Nachkt agreed, and Argente claimed that he wanted a droid to spy on Wat Tambor, believing that the Foreman was up to something. Initially, Argente wanted to buy R2-D2, but the scavenger told him that the Republic astromech droid was not for sale. Nachkt instead persuaded him into buying the special RA-7 protocol droid that the Foreman had given him, and Argente bought the droid and left. After the Koorivar's departure, the Trandoshan contacted Tambor, informing him of the mission's completion, and the Foreman then transmitted the credits to Nachkt's account."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Skytop Station"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "En route to Skytop Station, R2-D2 attempted to escape from the Vulture's Claw. Removing the restraining bolt keeping him confined, R2-D2 also managed to jettison an IG-86 sentinel droid that was guarding him into space. The scavenger, however, awoke from sleep in time to recapture the R2 unit and put him back into confinement. The astromech droid managed to contact Skywalker and transmit his location before Nachkt discovered the droid's actions and debilitated the R2 unit with an ion prod."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After arriving at Grievous's rendezvous point, the general instructed Nachkt to take R2-D2 apart and extract the information from him, allowing the Confederacy to gain information about the Republic and its strategies. To stop the Confederacy from gaining the information in R2-D2's databanks, Skywalker and a squad of clone troopers launched a mission to rescue R2-D2."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nachkt, having taken R2-D2 apart, discovered the extensive Republic information inside the droid. Deciding that the data was worth more than he had initially thought, Nachkt demanded more credits from Grievous, as the general himself also believed that the droid was worth more to him. After requesting a larger fee for his work, however, Grievous, having tired of the Trandoshan continually asking for more money, drew one of his stolen green-bladed lightsabers. Gha Nachkt was impaled from behind by Grievous's lightsaber, and the scavenger's life was ended."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although his ugly features hid his keen mind, Nachkt lacked morals, refraining from solidly siding himself with either the Republic or the Confederacy in order to gain more credits for whatever he found. The Trandoshan would search the debris left over from any battle to scavenge pieces he could sell to either the Republic or Confederacy. Nachkt lied and hid items of interest if he felt being honest would mean he would lose any merchandise he would otherwise be able to sell. As such, he hid R2-D2 from Tano and Skywalker when they searched for the droid aboard the Vulture's Claw. The Trandoshan was also greedy, reflected by his demands to General Grievous to raise his payment for R2-D2 above what they had originally agreed. This was also shown by his eagerness to accept a bribe from Argente. However, his greediness was ultimately his downfall, as the Trandoshan was killed when he requested a higher amount of payment from Grievous."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nachkt had a distinct lack of personal hygiene. Aboard the Vulture's Claw, he did not withhold flatulence, as was noticed by Ahsoka Tano upon visiting the Vulture's Claw while searching for R2-D2. His fingernails were often in need of a clipping, and his smelly feet even became legendary to others. The scavenger's right eye was injured in a cantina fight that he started on Coruscant, leaving a lasting asymmetry to his face. He was talented in starship piloting and droid programming."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gha Nachkt first appeared in \"Downfall of a Droid,\" an episode in the 2008 first season of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series. Nachkt also appeared in the following episode, \"Duel of the Droids,\" and was featured in the webcomic Discount, which led into \"Duel of the Droids.\" In both television episodes, Nachkt was voiced by Ron Perlman. Nachkt later received an entry in the July 2009 The Art of Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Nachkt's asymmetrical face design was used to further promote his corruption and untrustworthy elements. His character design was later used as the basis for Nack Movers, another Trandoshan appearing in the television series' second season episode \"Lightsaber Lost.\" A Trandoshan with an identical model and texture to Gha Nachkt is seen in Ziro's palace in the movie, stirring some debate, but this has not been officially confirmed as him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nachkt appeared in the Decide Your Destiny book Crisis on Coruscant, where it is possible for the reader, who is role-playing as a Jedi Padawan, to encounter Nachkt in Dex's Diner.
