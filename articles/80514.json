The terrain was made up of plains and forests, with heavy industrialization limited to the urban areas. There were four continents, Doxet on the eastern hemisphere and Elgar, Torm and Laz on the western hemisphere. The poles of the planet were covered in large ice caps."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The oceans of the planet were ripe and abundant with life.

They mapped the entire system within a short amount of time. Colonies were established on Acorvus, Dborian and the Rokwahl Asteroid Belt. The Lazerian monarchy exiled political dissenters and criminals to the neighboring planet, Acorvus. Dborian and Rokwahl held small mining outposts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, they had little interest in exploring the oceans or polar caps of their world. Nonetheless, the abundance of life in the seas made fishing a very popular enterprise. Due to the special conditions of the planet's ocean, the native Akwins remained undiscovered by the humans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the days of the Old Republic Lazerian IV was a loyal member world and Lazerian forces were highly respected. Jedi were admired by the populace and maintained a small outpost on the planet. However, this outpost had been destroyed in an ancient battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to its location on the Harrin Trade Corridor, the planet had a prospering economy. The entire industry was centered around import of raw materials and the manufacturing of high technology items. Despite its huge level of industrialization, the Lazerians were conscious of their environment and their factories produced little waste. This mindset also prevented an encounter with the native Akwins, which also valued nature highly, but preferred to be left alone.\nThe economic strength even increased with the establishment of the Kira Run, which connected the Harrin Trade Corridor with the Enarc Run. Lazerian became known as one of the \"Twin Stars of Kira\"."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Galactic Empire came to power in the galaxy, Lazerian IV was under the rule of King Alarik X and his queen Careese. The Lazerians saw the rise of Palpatine as the ultimate example of their societies model, in which rise was possible due to hard work. Lazierian IV did not oppose the Empire and Alarik X swore an oath of fealty to the Empire. The Empire left most of the business of Lazerian IV to the king; the only Imperial forces on the planet consisted of 36 Stormtroopers stationed at the Imperial embassy and a squadron of TIE/LN starfighters and an Imperial Customs contingent stationed at the Lazeria City Starport."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lazerians maintained a large military. Space defense was maintained by a small fleet, which consisted of 24 Z-95 Headhunters and two Lancer-class frigates around the time of the Battle of Endor. Additional to the large ground army the was an elite group called the King's Own Guard. They practiced a centuries-old chivalric code and were used for ceremonial and elite missions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the New Republic came to power, a small resistance movement began to spread among the Lazerians. However, due to the Empire's strong entrenchment, there were only around 50,000 supporters among the whole population. The leader was Princess Aereena, who kept her role secret to both her parents and her followers and acted the spoiled princess in public."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Lazerians"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The humans of Lazerian IV formed a class-based society with the following social classes (from top to bottom): Royalty, Nobility, Administrators, Military, Merchants, Landowners, Craftsmen, Tradesmen, Laborers and Rabble. The Lazerians believed that anyone gets what he deserved, so it was possible to rise through the social ranks with hard work. Hard work would improve the economy and this in turn would make the society stronger as a whole. They did not question the political views of outsiders, since most of their stable economy came from interplanetary trade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the society was only slow to accept greater changes. Having reached a plateau of a good economy, space flight and general comfort, new ideas find hardly any roots. It was said that the last new idea embraced was Palpatine."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Akwin"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Akwin were six-limbed mammalian aquatic species that lived in the oceans of Lazerian IV. Technology-wise they were on par with the Lazerians, but they had no interest in space travel. While they were aware of the state of galactic politics, they had no interest in the quarrels of \"immature\" species."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Government"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet was not united under one government. While the three western continents Laz, Torm and Elgar were ruled under the Kingdom of Devit, the eastern continent Doxet was a quasi city-state under the rule of Doxeti.
