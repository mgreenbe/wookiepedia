The design included a scope, a stock and a power pack point below and behind the barrel. It was particularly popular with mercenaries who favored heavy weaponry, and saw large amounts of use during the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic. As the largest heavy blaster rifle that Blastech produced it was fairly cumbersome and slow firing, but was capable of dropping most foes in a single blast. The weapon cost a total of 1980 and was thought to fill the niche between blaster rifles and repeating blasters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The DH-X was first shown in Dangerous Covenants a sourcebook released in 2014 for the Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying game produced by Fantasy Flight Games."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
