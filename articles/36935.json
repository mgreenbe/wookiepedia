The aliens were not identified in the film, but received a name in Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released the same day as the film's release. The name \"Dengue sisters\" was inspired by the Culisetto species' resemblance to mosquitoes; dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease. However, while the name Culisetto was inspired by the Culiseta genus of mosquitoes, the dengue virus is transmitted by mosquitoes of the Aedes genus."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
