In the year 22 ABY, the Human male technician Dean Jinzler intercepted a message from Chaf'orm'bintrano, an Aristocra of the sentient Chiss species, that was intended for the Human Jedi Master Luke Skywalker and was being transmitted through the sector communications relay post on the planet Comra.
