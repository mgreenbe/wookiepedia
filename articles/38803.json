In 3643 BBY, during the Cold War with the Sith Empire, a team of kidnappers from the Black Sun criminal syndicate attempted to escape to the spaceport as a diversion after they succeeded in kidnapping the Republic scientist Eli Tarnis from the Senate Tower. They were pursued by the Padawan Kira Carsen and a team Coruscant Security Force agents, and the two sides were locked in a stalemate in the hangar until a Jedi Knight\u2014the former apprentice of Jedi Master Orgus Din\u2014arrived.
