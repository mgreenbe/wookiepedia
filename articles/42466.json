However, Thrawn used a tracking device planted on the stolen vessel to track Zaarin down to a remote part of the Iast system. There, Thrawn trapped Zaarin's vessel, the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Glory, with the Immobilizer 418 cruiser Corvus. Ebolo then paired off with the Strike Cruiser Daring to assault Zaarin's vessel. The two ships suffered severe damage due to continued harassment from Glory and several transports. Fortunately, Maarek Stele defended the two ships and together they attacked the Star Destroyer. The Ebolo was destroyed in the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
