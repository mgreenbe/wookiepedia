It was used to enhance the flavor of various dishes, including nerf casserole, Ruugian noodles, and Vohan bean stew. It grew in the swamps and was harvested by local farmers. They sold it to Brack who would hire people to ship the moist mold to companies like Nebula Consumables and Falvin Foods who would dry and process it. The companies would usually pay between 220 and 250 credits per ton."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
