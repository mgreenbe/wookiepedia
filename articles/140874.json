Around thirty years after the Battle of Endor, she played at the pirate Maz Kanata's castle alongside Infrablue Zedbeddy Coggins, Ubert Quaril and Sudswater Dillifay Glon. While the group performed, Kanata spotted her old friend Han Solo entering the establishment, and yelled to him, causing the band to cease playing. Ralorsa and the others then resumed their song, but were soon interrupted again when many of the castle's residents rushed out to witness the destruction of the Hosnian system by the First Order's Starkiller Base superweapon. The castle was then attacked and destroyed by the forces of the First Order. Ralorsa had dark skin and black hair."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Taybin Ralorsa was created for Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in North America on December 18, 2015.
