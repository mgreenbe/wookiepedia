It was released when Waste Canister Delivery Port 84-D-21 in the Desrini District of Coruscant misfired. An isotope of hrucium, hrucium-5, was highly toxic. During the Cold War, a chemical freighter crashed on a moon and spilled large quantities of hrucium-5 onto the surface, damaging the wildlife and forcing the Arcona Senaru to seek help off-world to save his community and their homeworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
