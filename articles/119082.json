In 32 BBY, the year she turned fourteen and was expected to take up an apprenticeship, Tsabin was approached by Captain Quarsh Panaka of the Royal Naboo Security Forces, who asked her to hold off on accepting an apprenticeship until after the upcoming election, although he provided no details.

There, Amidala shared her personal name with them, and the girls decided what roles each would have in Amidala's service. At Tonsort's suggestion, the handmaidens changed their names as Amidala had for their privacy, some prestige, and so that Amidala going undercover as one of her own handmaidens would be less noticeable; with similar names, they would be more forgettable.

After letting Tonra in, Sab\u00e9 finally let her emotions flow freely, conveying anger and confusion at Amidala's death and the formation of the new Empire. After her outburst, Tonra asked Sab\u00e9 what she would do.

The pair began immediately organizing for their trip. Tonra informed Sab\u00e9 that he could get them a ship or at least a journey off-world and requested that Sab\u00e9 create the false IDs while he packed her bag.

Her contemplation was soon interrupted by her comm unit chiming, although Sab\u00e9 decided not to answer it. Tonra answered it and insisted that Sab\u00e9 talk to the caller.
