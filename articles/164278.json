He taught Ariq Jawaese and played an instrumental role in Ariq's plans to make peace between settlers, Jawas, and the Tusken Raiders. At some point, Wimateeka and his clan was invited to Eyvind and Ariela's wedding. About 31 members arrived at the wedding, bringing with them rock salt, a tiny droid, cloth, and water. The wedding was later attacked by a group of young Tusken Raiders attempting to steal a speeder. In the resulting confusion, Eyvind was killed and Ariela was captured. Wimateeka assisted in the negotiations for Ariela's release by translating the sand people language for Ariq."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1 ABY, Wimateeka's clan was attacked by Humans and aliens and several Jawas were killed in the raid.
