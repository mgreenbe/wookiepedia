The moon's surface was frequently barraged by meteor showers. During the Clone Wars, the moon housed the Rishi Station for the Galactic Republic, where communications were monitored to protect the planet Kamino. The Separatist Alliance attacked the moon during a covert mission, trying to give the Republic an \"all-clear\" signal to prevent the Republic fleet from protecting Kamino. Although that attack was thwarted, Separatist forces would attack Kamino later in the war."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
