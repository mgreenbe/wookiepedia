A user would enter the pressurized airlock wearing a space suit, and both exits would be sealed. At this point, the airlock could be safely depressurized so the user could exit the craft. Airlocks were sometimes used for executions as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some ships had airlocks as interior components, such as the prisoner cells aboard Zuckuss's ship, the Mist Hunter. Because Zuckuss would commonly keep his ship pumped full of ammonia, the prisoner cells had airlocks so that they could be filled with oxygen, which would prevent the captured bounty from suffocating, all the while leaving Zuckuss unaffected."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
