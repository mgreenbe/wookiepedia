This piece detailed the vast number of Sith Lords plummeting to the surface from a sky thick with ash. Felloux wrote that each rode a speeder named for a predatory animal that represented their individual personalities, and that the noise produced by the sheer number of repulsorlift vehicles drowned out the screams of those dying in the conflict. As of 36 ABY, the poem and Felloux had remained famous throughout the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Felloux was an original character mentioned in The New Essential Chronology, which was written by Daniel Wallace in 2005.
