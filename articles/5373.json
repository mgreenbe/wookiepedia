Caught behind the Iron Blockade enacted by Imperial Governor Ubrik Adelhard in the wake of the second Death Star's destruction, Eerin operated in the sector on worlds such as Bespin and Burnin Konn, where she publicly posed as a traveling merchant, while covertly trading in a variety of secrets stored on holodiscs. She directed the acquisition specialists, whose role was to travel to locations and acquire any data, cargo, or artifacts that would further expand the Seeker's archives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a period of rebellious unrest in the sector, the Mon Calamari merchant came into contact with an up-and-coming young smuggler from Burnin Konn. On a number of occasions, Eerin passed along information and tips leading to opportunities for work to the smuggler, and the two colleagues forged a friendly working relationship.
