Limbs could be lost intentionally, in battle, or accidentally. It was relatively common for such an injury to be inflicted during lightsaber combat, as lightsabers could cut through almost any substance. Individuals who had lost limbs were usually outfitted with cybernetic prosthetics."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The term was also used in reference to severing the limbs of droids, or limbs that were already prosthetic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Naboo, Jedi Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi severed Darth Maul's torso from his waist to avenge the death of his Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn at Maul's hands. During the First Battle of Geonosis, the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus severed Padawan Anakin Skywalker's right arm in a lightsaber duel. Skywalker exacted revenge three years later by cutting off Tyranus' hands with his lightsaber during the Battle of Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the issuing of Order 66, Maul, now a renegade Sith, engaged with multiple clone troopers during a skirmish aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tribunal, having been a prisoner onboard the ship before Ahsoka Tano released him as a diversion for the brainwashed clones. Encountering a squad in one hallway, Maul drove them back using the Force before telekinetically pulling one trooper's arm through a closing blast door, with the arm being severed when the door closed. This allowed Maul to steal the trooper's wrist-comm and eavesdrop on the clones' transmissions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After turning to the dark side of the Force, Skywalker dueled his former Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and lost both legs, as well as his left arm. The loss of all of his remaining limbs, burn injuries and subsequent reconstruction as a cyborg caused the fallen Jedi to all but fully embrace his new Sith identity as Darth Vader, Sith Lord and apprentice to Emperor Palpatine. As a Dark Lord of the Sith, Vader oversaw the training of the Inquisitorius\u2014a group of fallen Jedi who turned against the Jedi Order in the aftermath of Order 66. To teach his Jedi hunters a lesson in the pain of loss, Vader dismembered the right hand of Fifth Brother and the left forearm of Sixth Brother."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ninth Sister was a frequent victim of dismemberment, losing her left eye to Darth Vader, her right leg to Sixth Brother and her right hand to Cal Kestis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the era of the Galactic Empire, Kenobi dismembered the Aqualish thug Ponda Baba in self-defense. Years later, Luke Skywalker lost his right hand in a duel against his own father. Skywalker fought Vader once more during the Battle of Endor, and this time he emerged victorious after severing his father's right cybernetic hand."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the last day of the New Republic, Chewbacca ripped off one of the arms of the Crolute junk boss Unkar Plutt after he threatened the Jakku scavenger Rey, the Wookiee's newest friend. Sometime afterwards, when Rey was brought before Supreme Leader Snoke of the First Order, the dark side warrior Kylo Ren took advantage of the situation to kill Snoke and usurp his throne, cutting off through Snoke's waist and wrists."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "So far, all Star Wars movies of the Skywalker Saga have featured dismemberment of either organic or artificial limbs.
