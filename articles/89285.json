The group had known ties to the Zygerrians, a species notorious for their massive slave empire. Since the asteroid field made hyperspace travel impossible, any craft that traveled the area had to drift through the field hoping to avoid detection. The pirates would wait for passing civilian cruisers, attacking them with little chance of resistance since luxury craft were usually minimally armed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Separatist Crisis, a time of political turmoil in the Galactic Senate, the pirates attacked and scuttled the Sy Myrthian passenger liner, the Elegant Wake. Taking all 456 registered passengers as slaves, the government of Sy Myrth was at a disadvantage to retrieve the prisoners as the planet had only just withdrawn from the Republic, loosing access to the Republic's Supreme Court."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The following year the Clone Wars erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the pirates went unchecked.
