A barren world without an atmosphere, Akaan was orbited by two moons. After the Taung forces of Mandalore the First journeyed from Roon to conquer the uninhabited planet that became Mandalore, the newly renamed Mandalorians spread out to conquer the planets of the surrounding system, including Akaan.
