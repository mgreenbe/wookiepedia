Around the year 3643 BBY, Captain Juvarek was stationed in the tomb of the Sith Lord Ajunta Pall on Korriban near the world's Sith Academy. During his time stationed in the tomb, Juvarek commanded Sergeant Cormun and other soldiers of the Empire's Fifth Infantry company of the Korriban regiment to exterminate an infestation of worm-like k'lor'slugs by destroying their egg chambers.
