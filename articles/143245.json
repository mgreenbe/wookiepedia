Known as the Way in ancient times, the Force was viewed in many different aspects, including, but not limited to, the Light side of the Force, the Dark side of the Force, the Living Force, the Unifying Force, the Cosmic Force and the Physical Force. The first two aspects were concerned with the moral compass of the Force, as manifested by the conduct and emotions of living creatures who were themselves part of the fabric of the Force. The light side of the Force was the facet aligned with compassion, selflessness, self-knowledge and enlightenment, healing, mercy and benevolence, while the dark side of the Force was aligned with hatred, fear, covetousness, anger, aggression, jealousy and malevolence. The latter four aspects were defined by prominent Jedi philosophies: The Living Force dealt with the energy of living things; the Unifying Force, with the entirety of time and space; the Cosmic Force, with life after death; and the Physical Force, with anything within one's surroundings. Though the Force was categorized in this way, no specific abilities or powers were only usable by a follower of a particular path of the Force; the Force partially existed inside the life forms that used it, and drew energy from their emotions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some beings, particularly the Sith, believed that the dark side of the Force was more powerful than the light, though it was possible that the dark side was just more tempting to those who used it (or desired to use it). Others thought of the Force as an entity capable of intelligent thought, almost as a sort of deity. Anakin Skywalker, who was believed to have been conceived by the Force itself, may have shared this belief; if this was indeed the case, it would add credence towards the view of the Force as a sentient entity. Though the Force was thought to flow through every living thing, its power could only be harnessed by beings described as \"Force-sensitive.\" This Force-sensitivity was correlated with, and sometimes attributed to, a high count of internal microorganisms called midi-chlorians that were found in a Force-sensitive's blood: the higher the count, the greater the being's potential Force ability, though there were some exceptions to this rule. Force-sensitive beings were able to tap into the Force to perform acts of great skill and agility as well as control and shape the world around them. Sometimes this ability was described as having a strong Force \"aura.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Early history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 36,453 BBY, philosophers and scientists from several Star systems gathered on Tython to share mystical knowledge. The Force was \"discovered.\" Unfortunately, in 25,793 BBY, several Tythan scholars began using their knowledge of the Force to pursue power, leading to the beginning of the Force Wars.

To remedy this situation, the Force had long ago been broken down into four aspects: the Living, the Unifying, the Cosmic and the Physical Force. In this way scholars might choose to focus on the tangible realities of the world and how the Force manifested itself in the lives of individuals and within the moment, or to delve deeper, reaching outside themselves to wonder at the mysteries of the universe on an infinite scale."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The idea of a Living Force reflects that aspect of the Force which connects all living beings. It represents the tangible Force: the Force as it exists in the present, which flows about all things to allow a Forceful being to sense life and death. Scholars of the Living Force like Qui-Gon Jinn espoused a philosophy of \"living in the moment,\" relying heavily on their instincts and concentrating more on a sensitivity to living things, rather than on fulfilling destiny or looking to the future. They believed that the future's instabilities caused uncertainty, and that the present held the answers to near-future events."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The idea of a Unifying Force reflects that aspect of the Force which requires a significantly greater amount of understanding than the Living Force, for it manifests the Force as a single cosmic power that can reveal visions of the future that are of particular significance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The idea of a Cosmic Force reflects that aspect of the Force which connects the Living Force to a unifying gestalt, allowing users to merge with, or to become \"one\" with the Force, but also manifest themselves as Force ghosts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The idea of a Physical Force reflects that aspect of the Force which allows one to manipulate objects within his or her surroundings."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The light side of the Force"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The light side of the Force was concerned with the ideals of good, benevolence, and healing. Followers of the light side strove to live in harmony with the world around them, acting out of wisdom and logic rather than anger and hasty judgment. In order to achieve harmony with the light side of the Force, its practitioners would often meditate to clear themselves of emotion\u2014particularly negative emotions such as aggression, fear, anger, and hatred, since these were thought to lead to, or entice one to an acceptance of, the dark side of the Force."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Jedi Order"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The largest group of proponents and teachers of the light side was the Jedi Order, who strove to maintain peace and justice throughout the galaxy. The values of the light side were encapsulated in the Jedi Code. The Jedi accepted the view of there being two sides to the Force: the dark side and the light side. A follower of the light side tried to live selflessly, in harmony with those around him, and in harmony with \"the will of the Force\" itself. Mutual trust, respect, and the ability to form alliances gave the Jedi their distinct advantage over the Sith. In contrast, a follower of the dark side typically used the dark side of the Force out of selfish motives. As such, use of the dark side of the Force was forbidden within the Jedi Order, and was strictly considered the domain of the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Traditional Jedi were keen to keep the Force \"in balance.\" They attempted to achieve this by destroying the Sith and denying the dark side, essentially \"keeping balance\" by restoring the Force to its natural state, as they viewed the dark side as corrupt. This involved the purging of negative emotions such as aggression, anger, and hatred, since they could easily bring on acceptance of the dark side. In contrast, positive emotions such as compassion and courage nurtured the light side of the Force. The Jedi Code compared such feelings and provided insight into the ethical use of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Passion was considered dangerous, as it could lead to strong emotions that could unbalance the Jedi and lead them to the dark side. Love, curiously, was regarded by both the Jedi and Sith Orders as something to be avoided. While the Jedi espoused compassion, a broad, all-encompassing, self-sacrificing love for all beings, love for another being\u2014romance, a possessive love by nature\u2014was shunned in the post\u2013Ruusan Reformation era Jedi Order. Possession of all types was shunned in the post-Ruusan order, the only exceptions being a Jedi's lightsaber and personal raiment. The Jedi viewed love as a danger best left untouched. While the passion that came with love could lead to hatred and anger, as Anakin Skywalker demonstrated in his transformation into a Sith because of his love for Padm\u00e9 Amidala, it could also lead to pity, mercy, self-sacrifice and compassion, emotions the Sith did not see as beneficial, as demonstrated by Darth Vader in sacrificing himself to save his son from the Emperor at the end of his life, thus bringing balance to the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With a few minor exceptions, the original Jedi Order lasted largely unchanged in structure and philosophy for twenty-five thousand years, despite many detrimental conflicts with various Sith Empires and an attempted purge by the Sith Triumvirate. However, in 19 BBY, the Order was annihilated by the Sith Lords Darth Sidious and Darth Vader in what would later become known as the Great Jedi Purge. When the Order was reconstructed by Luke Skywalker after the deaths of Sidious and Vader, it underwent a substantial change in both philosophy and policies, as Luke possessed little information regarding the structure of the Old Jedi Order and disagreed with some of its practices."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The dark side of the Force"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The dark side of the Force was considered by the Jedi to be the element aligned with selfishness, fear, hatred, aggression, and malice toward all living things. Such emotions seemed to increase the strength and abilities of a user of the dark side, providing a path towards personal power and the destruction or control of all opposition. It was generally accepted that use of the dark side of the Force was extremely addictive. Dark-side Jedi were known as Dark Jedi. But some light-side Jedi, such as Luke Skywalker, Kyle Katarn, Jaden Korr, and Galen Marek, could use dark-side powers."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Sith Order"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The earliest incarnations of the Sith Order were similar to the Jedi Order in structure. Many Sith of various ranks and abilities comprised the Order, which was often under the control of a single Dark Lord who wielded absolute authority. Over the centuries, numerous Sith Empires utilizing this power structure rose to challenge the Republic for control over the galaxy. Though several Sith Empires brought the Republic to the brink of defeat, they were all plagued by infighting amongst the power-hungry Sith overlords who controlled them, and ultimately the Jedi and the Republic triumphed against all of them. With the advent of the Sith Lord Darth Bane, however, the Order underwent a revolutionary overhaul. Bane considered the Force to be finite and thus ideally for exclusive use by the Dark Lord. He eliminated the practice of having vast numbers of Sith at the same time, thereby aiming to concentrate the dark side of the Force into two individuals: a Sith Master and his or her apprentice. In addition, he hoped to eliminate the infighting that had plagued previous Sith Orders. This reformed Order went on to achieve that the Sith Empires of old never could; the annihilation of the Jedi Order and the defeat of the Republic. However, Bane's Order was destroyed when Luke Skywalker redeemed the Sith Lord Darth Vader, who turned on his master Darth Sidious and killed him at the cost of his own life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though Bane's tradition, or \"Rule of Two,\" would continue to influence the Sith for years to come, Sidious and Vader were the final Lords of Bane's orthodox Order. Following their deaths in 4 ABY, the Dark Lady Lumiya made a small but significant number of changes to Bane's philosophy. Trained by Vader and having had significant exposure to both him and Sidious, she had come to view the Order under Sidious and Vader as having been selfish and ineffective. Given this, she resolved to change the core philosophy of the Banite Sith. While she still viewed the light side as inferior due to the Jedi's history of being unable to affect change, she believed that a proper Sith Lord should rule selflessly, making decisions that would benefit the greatest number of people no matter how personally painful those decisions might be. In theory, negative emotions like hate would be crucial in maintaining the power of the dark side within such a Sith, but would not be allowed to influence their decisions. Such a Sith would theoretically be able to ruthlessly maintain order, yet govern with compassion. Her philosophy culminated in the creation of Darth Caedus, the grandson of Darth Vader. In a manner somewhat similar to Palpatine, Caedus gained control over the primary galactic government and sought to impose his idea of order on it's people. However, his reign was cut short by the Jedi, and Lumiya's school of thought died with him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rule of Two was later rejected entirely by Darth Krayt, who instituted the Rule of One, using \"One\" to refer to the Sith Order itself, which encompassed many minions, acolytes/adepts and lords, and were led by only one Dark Lord of the Sith (or Dread Lord). Superficially, this reincarnation of the Order was no different from the ancient variations of the Sith Empires. However, Darth Krayt believed that his philosophy gave the Sith and their power a purpose, unlike Darth Bane, who believed that power was its own purpose. Unlike previous Sith Orders, the Rule of One called for cooperation and even some level of loyalty between the Sith. Most importantly however, the Rule of One called for complete and utter loyalty to the Dread Lord. These two rules of Krayt's Order were designed to prevent the infighting of past Sith Orders while still retaining the ability to field large numbers of Sith, the lack of which had been a notable shortcoming of Bane's Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the Rule of One did not represent the Sith as a whole, and Krayt was even labeled a heretic by the holocrons of Darth Bane, Darth Nihilus and Darth Andeddu, all of whom believed that Krayt's Order would ultimately turn on itself as so many similarly structured Sith Orders had. In addition to Krayt's Rule of One, there was a previous Rule of One philosophy created by Darth Sidious. In Sidious's case however, the \"One\" referred simply to himself, as he believed that, with him, the Sith had reached their absolute peak in terms of power and ability. As such, he discarded Bane's idea of training a more powerful replacement and intended to reign forever as the galaxy's sole leader."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Potentium belief"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Potentium view of the Force, not to be confused with the Unifying Force, was strictly disapproved by the old Jedi Order. While similar to the Unifying Force, which suggested that there was only one Force that did not take sides, the Potentium view stated that the Force and the galaxy in general were inherently good. According to this belief, the so-called dark side was not made up of specific \"parts\" or \"abilities\" of the Force: as espoused by the Light Side, it existed inside the life form which used it, made from their emotions. By that standard, and unlike the Light Side, all Potentium followers could perform any action and use the Force in any way they saw fit, as long as the intention behind it was good. In contrast, the Old Jedi Order acknowledged the existence of Potentium, but made it clear that it was subverting of the Jedi teaching and a way to misguide people to the dark side, or a means to serve it. The living planet Zonama Sekot supported the Potentium theory of the Force as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Alternate views on the Force"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Way of the Dark"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Way of the Dark, or simply the Dark, was a view of the Force taken up by Cronal and those that taught him. It was effectively the polar opposite of the Potentium, but taken a step further. This Way of the Dark belief did not just deny the existence of the Light side of the Force; it stated that the Force itself was simply a small extension of the Dark. This system stated that destruction was the universal constant that all things worked towards, going so far as to call it the \"will of the universe.\" An initiate was taught that if one made destruction his primary goal, with whatever scheme he was taking part in being a secondary objective, then the Dark would effectively reward the initiate for the devastation caused by pushing the secondary objective to success."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a prime example of this, Cronal cited that Palpatine was able to achieve success against the Jedi and the Republic because his primary motive was the destruction of both parties. However, once he had achieved these goals and set about consolidating his rule and building the Empire, his focus shifted from destruction to creation, in total opposition to universal processes. Thus when before he could not fail, now he could never succeed."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The insidious Force"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kreia, an exiled Jedi and former Sith living during the Old Sith Wars, believed the Force to be akin to a deceptively sinister, indifferent god. She pointed to the numerous wars fought by countless sentients that formed a symbiotic relationship with everything else, that depended on the Force; the dichotomy of the light and dark with its constantly re-occurring conflicts, as evidence that the Force cared nothing for the lives it consumed, so long as balance was achieved. This philosophy emphasized individualism, believing that if individuals were to be truly free, the will of the Force had to be severed from sentients through their individual will. This viewpoint was condemned by the Jedi and Sith, both organizations dependent on the Force, though Kreia's teachings passed on to Meetra Surik."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, after the defeat of the dark-side entity Abeloth, Grand Master Luke Skywalker came to a similar conclusion regarding the nature of the Force. While he ascribed no intentions or emotions to the Force, he believed that the Force being out of balance was the cause of the horrific amount of death and chaos that had occurred in the time since the death of the Ones. Instead of believing that the Force should be destroyed, however, Luke instead took the approach that, to keep the galaxy at peace, Force-adepts had to actively maintain the balance of the Force."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Aing-Tii beliefs"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Aing-Tii monks from the Kathol Rift viewed the Force in a way different, but similar to that of the Jedi. Instead of the dark and the light sides of the Force, they viewed it as having many colors, much like a rainbow. They believed that the Force could manifest itself in different ways, which allowed a being to develop unique abilities, unknown to most of the Jedi and the Sith. They believed the Force was much too complicated to be just light or dark. According to their beliefs, Force-users were not strictly good or evil, but instead had their place in a larger spectrum."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "White Current"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Fallanassi called the Force the White Current and saw it like the river flowing through the galaxy and all living beings. A single person could not alter the current any more than a being could divert a river with one hand. Thus, the Fallanassi immersed themselves in the Current, letting it flow through them.

These abilities could take a multitude of forms, including telepathy, telekinesis, and enhanced physical and metaphysical perception. It can allow people to affect and some control over physical forces, such as kinetic energy, inertia, friction, pressure and even gravity, allowing them to be able to defy all of these and enhance the force and momentum they create, with a variety of different effects and range. Such things allowed users of the Force to be almost completely unharmed by extreme impact, such as falling from great heights or being struck with great force or at high speed. It should be noted that anticipating the impact lessened its effects, allowing some users of the Force to not be stunned or even land on their feet with ease. This effectively enhanced the physical durability and recovery capability of a Force-user."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Power over physical forces and momentum also allowed force users to partially defy gravity and other weight, allowing them to move and jump at unnatural speed and distance in seconds, though the speed only worked for limited times and was not constant while jumping could be done repeatedly to those who have mastered this ability. This effectively enhanced the agility of those who used it, giving the user acrobatic capabilities at unnatural levels. The vitality, health, stamina, and endurance of a Force user was naturally enhanced to varying degrees and could even be temporarily boosted further by those more powerful and skilled, notably allowing aged or crippled users to be able to temporarily transcend their physical weaknesses or to allow a user to temporarily enhance their physical abilities beyond the limitations of their respective species. A skilled user could use techniques to control their physical condition to the point of controlling their ability to feel pain or putting themselves in a trance that simulates suspended animation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Force could be used to bend the will of weak-minded beings and guide an adept's body. Users who were very good at using the Force could cease merely reacting to their surroundings and actually predict events in the very near future, such as the next blow in a duel. Guidance like this enabled Luke Skywalker to launch a proton torpedo into an extremely difficult target on the Death Star in the Battle of Yavin. The Force could also be used to induce mental or physical incapacitation, such as sedation or induced sleep. Qui-Gon Jinn used this power on Jar Jar Binks when traveling the dangerous underwater path to Theed. Qui-Gon placed a hand on Jar Jar's shoulder and asked him to relax, causing the Gungan to almost lose consciousness. Obi-Wan, observing the extreme change in Jar Jar's behavior, told Jinn, his master, \"You overdid it.\" This ability also allowed the Jedi Master Fay to pull away the thoughts of Asajj Ventress, causing her to faint. Further techniques could allow users to subtly or fully manipulate the minds, emotions, memories, and willpower of their targets, with some Force users being able to enhance, decrease and drain it from their targets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to enhancing their own skill, Force users were capable of channeling the energy of the Force directly into the world around them. Dark-side users generally used the Force for abilities that were malicious, immoral and unnatural, such as the technique of telekinetically choking, strangling or otherwise physically damaging their victims. The Sith were infamous for heavily using this ability to conjure Force lightning, which would deliver copious and often lethal amounts of electricity to the desired target. The Jedi preferred to use their abilities to heal and protect, closing wounds and shielding others with barriers of Force energy. Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn discovered that Jedi could achieve near-immortality through the Force by existing as a Force ghost after death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some Force users even learned to transfer their spirit into another body. Palpatine used this technique to prolong his life, and evidence suggests the legendary Dark Jedi Set Harth, who fell to the dark side in the aftermath of the New Sith Wars, used this power to leapfrog his essence between hundreds of clone bodies, lingering in the physical realm until the Yuuzhan Vong invasion and beyond. Later Callista Ming transferred herself to the body of a dying friend so that she could stay alive. Callista, unlike Harth and Palpatine, lost her ability to touch the Force in the process of transference."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Others, such as Darth Nihilus and the Jedi Exile, could use the Force to feed off other Force users. Nihilus' power could encompass entire planets and drain them of life, like the Miraluka colony world of Katarr. Some dark-side users could use a different and weaker form of this technique to drain the strength of others into themselves, occasionally to fatal results. Darth Nihilus' ability to do this originated from a \"wound in the Force,\" which is essentially a rip in the fabric of the Force itself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Palpatine mentioned that the Force could help one cheat death, or create life, a secret mastered only by Darth Plagueis. Another Sith Lord, Darth Sion, used a more indirect method to cheat death. As he could call upon his pain to strengthen his will and allow him to rise up again as strong as he was beforehand, he was arguably immortal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Force played a major part in the Jedi use of a lightsaber, in that their heightened awareness kept them from accidentally injuring themselves while using the weapon in combat, as the blade had no relative weight, making it difficult to judge its position. Similarly, the Force allowed a Jedi to use his/her lightsaber to deflect incoming blaster bolts. The Force also came into play during the construction of a lightsaber, both in assembling its intricate innards, and the initial charging of the power cell."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Manipulating the Force entailed significant risks, however. When a person used the Force beyond their body's ability to sustain it, the individual could suffer physical damage, accelerated aging, or in an extreme case, certain death by burning their own body cells from the inside out.

This naturally happened to those who relied on the dark side of the Force for their power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For most users, physical or mental fatigue, stress, or disorientation would weaken, nullify or invalidate their power in the Force. In the event of exhausting or stressing their powers or themselves, physically or mentally, users had to wait before they could use it again, or refrain from using it until they regained sobriety, willpower and calmness. Emotions could also affect the strength of a user's abilities, which, depending on the user, could increase or reduce strength. For dark-side users, positive, non-aggressive and peaceful emotions would potentially weaken them, as strength in the Force could naturally be increased by raw, intense and aggressive feelings, but not without risk of being corrupted by the dark side. Such instances could hamper or limit Force abilities, especially in combat, resulting in Force users resorting to physical combat especially with a lightsaber. The ability was usually accompanied by motion of the eyes, hands or even the entire body, the last being the most common way to use the power, which could also limit the ability, especially when the user's mind or senses were strained or overwhelmed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Disturbances in the Force"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Force existed in all life, and when great amounts of life passed away, a disturbance was created, running through the Force like a scream that Force adepts could hear. This was how a \"wound in the Force\" was created at the battle of Malachor V during the Mandalorian Wars when the Mass Shadow Generator was unleashed, and when the Mandalorians destroyed the cities of Serroco using nuclear weapons. This happened again when Alderaan was destroyed; Obi-Wan Kenobi sensed \"a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.\" The students of the Jedi Praxeum felt a similar disturbance when the Carida system was destroyed. It was suggested that Yoda could not even stand on Kashyyyk as Order 66 was being executed. It was as if Yoda was being overpowered by the disturbance caused by the many simultaneous Jedi deaths. It is possible that those strong in the Force could have glimpses of what was creating the disturbance, though the severity that the adept would feel would depend on numerous variables, including both their training and their innate connection with the Force. This could explain why Yoda seemed to know what happened when Obi-Wan Kenobi was about to look at the security recordings of the Jedi Temple. However, while typically called \"disturbances,\" they were sometimes referred to as \"tremors,\" as Darth Vader did about Obi-Wan's presence on Death Star I.

The Force also bears a close similarity to the Chinese notion of q\u00ec or q\u00ecg\u014dng, and the splitting of the Force into light side and dark sides echoes the concept of yin and yang in Eastern philosophy (though this is not a perfect translation, as the dark side is considered a force of evil by the Jedi, and this moral duality is not the same as the Eastern concept).[source?] Along with the concepts of yin and yang, the concept of a ubiquitous Force parallels the real-world concept of a \"Tao\" or \"way,\" which is said to flow everywhere in the universe. The concept of the Force also borrows heavily from Hindu theology, which also expresses a belief in a unifying Brahman energy that composes and is a composite of the Universe (and by extension, God), and can be used for either good or bad. In fact, this is particularly similar to the concept of the Potentium and the Unifying Force in that while the power can be perverted for evil, it ultimately leads only to a conclusion that is good."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A connection could be drawn to Zoroastrianism with the duality of the Force. The dichotomy between Ahura Mazda (the One God) and Angra Mainyu/Ahrima (the evil spirit) is nearly identical to the concept of the light and dark sides of the Force. Another connection can be found in the spirits of Christian philosophies: Jedi spirits resemble God's angels and/or saints, and dark-side Sith spirits (most often of Sith Lords) are akin to souls in hell or even perhaps devils themselves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another connection that can be made is towards the Hebrew religion and how it treated blood: Blood is the life source of every living creature, and during temple sacrifices, the Hebrews make sure to spill as much blood as possible, to \"return\" the life force of the animal to God.
