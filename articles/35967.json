In order to use their magic, the Presagers needed a nexus for the dark side of the Force, such as those found on Hakotei or Asusto. They also believed that a \"conduit\" would come along that would allow them to use their magic to see every possible future. When he came to Asusto with Jedi Master Lene Kostana and her Padawan Sifo-Dyas, the Presagers believed a young Dooku was such a conduit. As a result of their ritual, he saw many potential futures, including futures in which the Jedi conquered the Galactic Republic. He also saw a vision of his future Master, Darth Sidious."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Death magic first appeared in the 2019 audio drama Dooku: Jedi Lost, which was written by Cavan Scott."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
