Large bore weapons but may not have been so effective at killing a tusklan due to the possibility of missing vital organs. A small bore weapon allowed for more frequent shots, but vital points may still have been missed on the creature. Thousands of stingflies being encouraged to attack a tusklan, however, from all sides would have been more effective, killing the creature with it not knowing whether the attack came from."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
