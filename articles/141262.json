Additionally, the blade was well balanced, capable of being used with the off hand by those who were capable of using two weapons simultaneously. The balanced blade also made it a useful throwing knife. These weapons were not simply used to battle opponents but to cripple them upon victory."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tehk'la blades were individually crafted for the owner of the weapon, and often they were crafted by the owner himself.
