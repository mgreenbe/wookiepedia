The fleet was led by Admiral Meori and consisted of six Imperial II-class Star Destroyers. During the battle against the Alliance Fleet and the Mon Cala Mercantile Fleet, the Mon Cala vessel Aurora Flare conducted a suicidal run against the flagship of the blockade, destroying it when Imperial forces ignited the Aurora Flare's coaxium cargo. The breach allowed for the rebellious naval forces to escape, although Imperial ships moved in and destroyed The Regency on Mon Cala's surface."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
