It acted as both one of the largest archives ever constructed and the gravity anchor for a swarm of one billion acid larvae. To approach the station clearance codes were needed. Data recovered from the Techno Union, including the memories of the 0-0-0 personality matrix, were stored on Hivebase-1 by the Empire, and following the Battle of Yavin, 0-0-0 ordered Doctor Chelli Aphra and a team of mercenaries to recover his memories from the station. It was ultimately destroyed after Aphra tricked the Imperials into detonating the exploding Tookas she released onto the station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
