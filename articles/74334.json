She led the pacification of Sammun, participated in battles against the Grysks and defeated Grand Admiral Savit in a skirmish against the Third Fleet. When Faro was promoted to the rank of a commodore, she was promised the command of the Task Force 231, but Thrawn recommended against her transfer, suggesting that she was capable to lead an entire fleet.

Faro found the process to be revolting, but its tactical implications were nevertheless interesting. Later she joined the Imperial Navy and at some point had an opportunity to visit a star system where a newly commissioned Star Destroyer was being equipped and crewed. During her service Faro became suspicious of superior officers who had gained their position through political contacts rather than being good at their jobs, and as a result she often toed the line towards insubordination.

Thrawn trusted Faro to lead the task force while the admiral took a captured smuggler ship and one of the light cruisers, Shyrack, to observe Admiral Durril's attack against Scrim Island on Batonn. Faro completed her mission successfully destroying two enemy ships and capturing four others along with a cache of small-arms ordnance.

Along with the promotion she was promised a task force of her own, but six weeks after the promotion Faro was still serving on the Chimaera and was rather uncertain where her future would lay, especially since Thrawn's former aide, Eli Vanto, had unexpectedly disappeared from the Seventh Fleet. When Emperor Palpatine ordered Thrawn and Chimaera to assist Darth Vader in dealing with a Force disturbance centered on a planet called Batuu, Faro accompanied them leaving Commander Woldar to lead the Seventh Fleet in their absence. Faro was not happy to have passengers on her ship, because she thought passengers didn't belong on the war-ship in the first place, and especially since Vader and his special Stormtrooper unit demanded changes in the ship's daily routines. However, Faro did her best to accommodate their guests, as Thrawn called them, even if it meant confronting influential and troublesome Chief Hangar Master of the Chimaera, Xoxtin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "En-route to Batuu Chimaera encountered a mysterious obstruction on the hyperlane. After several failed attempts at returning to hyperspace Faro suggested that they might instead travel to Mokivj, where they could turn on a different hyperlane that would take them to Batuu and save fourteen or fifteen hours of travel time. Thrawn accepted Commodore's suggestion and ordered the Chimaera to set course for Mokivj despite Darth Vader's warning that the alternative route would not save more than eleven hours. Faro's daring in making the suggestion in the first place, as well as the curiosity she showed toward Thrawn's past visit to that area of space, irritated Vader but Thrawn was interested in hearing his crew's suggestions and was not insulted by Faro's inquiries. When the Chimaera reached Mokivj it turned out Vader's time estimate was more accurate than Faro's.

When a group of enemy ships appeared out of hyperspace and headed for the same area where Thrawn and Vader had landed, Faro reported their arrival to the Grand Admiral. Against Thrawn's advice Vader ordered the First Legion transport Darkhawk to intercept and capture one of the approaching ships while Chimaera stayed out of sight, but Faro ordered four TIE/d \"Defender\" Multi-Role Starfighters led by Vult Skerris to assist the First Legion in their mission. That first encounter with the Grysks was only half-successful; while the Imperials seizes the target vessel and captured several warriors, the Grysk had enough time to destroy their cargo, and escape with several prisoners taken from Batuu.

While Faro was again left in charge of Chimaera Thrawn, Vader and the First Legion took a freighter to the other end of the hyperlane, where they purposefully triggered the Grysk trap and turned it against the aliens, capturing one of their ambushing ships and a number of its crew.

After a brief skirmish that claimed the lives of four Imperials and most of the captured Grysks, Faro, Thrawn, Vader, and Commander Kimmund of the First Legion held a meeting in the Darkhawk's cockpit. Durin the meeting Thrawn pressed Faro with questions, leading her to reach the same conclusions that the Grand Admiral had already come to. Thrawn believed the Grysks were using the old separatist factory on Mokivj as a base, where the aliens had intended to study the Darkhawk and where they had taken some of the prisoners they had escaped with from Batuu. When Chimaera reached Mokivj and discovered Grysks in the process of stealing yet another moon from the planet's orbit, Thrawn prepared to leave Faro in command of the assault against the Grysks ships while the Grand Admiral himself planned to lead a ground operation to rescue the prisoners that had been taken into the factory.

During the battle the Grysks tried to send tugs rigged with bombs to attack the Chimaera but the Star Destroyer's turbolasers destroyed them before they could cause any harm. Seeing their tug trick failing one of the Grysk ships broke away from the battle and despite TIE Defenders pursuing it the vessel managed to escape to hyperspace taking captured Chiss children with it. When Thrawn ordered Chimaera and the TIEs to destroy all Grysk ships Faro asked if they shouldn't take at least some prisoners that might lead them to where the Grysks had taken their prizes. Thrawn acknowledged her concern but did not change his orders and all the remaining Grysk ships were destroyed.

After they had reached their destination Faro was concerned to see that the Grysk ships waiting there outnumbered the Imperials two to one, and the ship that had escaped Mokivj with the Chiss prisoners was also expected to arrive shortly after Chimaera. Thrawn and Vader planned to use one TIE Defender and the Darkhawk to ambush the ship carrying prisoners when it would arrive, and only then they would deal with the two waiting ships. When the First Legion had rescued the children from the Grysks, Thrawn sent the TIE fighters to deal with one Grysk vessel while Chimaera continued on toward the other one. Having already seen where the first Grysk ship had its gunports, Faro ordered Chimaera's gunners to target the same spots on their opponent, with full confidence that with Thrawn and Vader's leadership they could deal with anything the Grysks attempted."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Uncertain future"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Chimaera returned form Batuu, Faro expected to be called back to Coruscant for pre-command orientation for Task Force 231, but as the weeks passed and the summon didn't come she started to wonder what was going on.

To her further annoyance Ronan refused to hand over data from the cargo shipments that had passed through the transfer point to the tactical analysis team of the Chimaera, demanding that only Thrawn and Faro would be allowed to study the listing, as a result Faro had to work through the information on her own. Faro's work was also disturbed by Ronan's unexpected announcement that it had been Thrawn who had somehow blocked her transfer to Task Force 231.

When the vectors of twenty-eight of the forty-one lost ships seemed to point toward other systems, Faro and Thrawn were convinced that the grallocs were wrongly blamed for the disappearances and in truth most of the ships in fact had been stolen. From the likely target system of the lost Allanar N3 they found a damaged mobile way station that had been used as a transfer point for the stolen cargoes, but finding the ship itself required Faro to have Chimaera follow the exact vector the Allanar had disappeared along. What they discovered was that the Grysks had somehow found out about the cargo transfers and had attacked the way station as well as the Allanar N3. Both Faro and Thrawn were deeply concerned to find Grysks involved in an operation almost half across the Empire from Batuu where they had previously faced the alien invaders."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Teaming up with the Chiss"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to the Grysks they also discovered a Chiss Ascendancy vessel Steadfast that had been tracking a Grysk ship across the Empire and had witnessed the Grysk attack against Allanar N3. The Chiss and the Imperials joined forces to battle against Grysk warship and observation post. Faro was surprised to learn that her former shipmate Eli Vanto\u2014a man she had assumed to be dead\u2014was now serving as a lieutenant of the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet under Admiral Ar'alani's command on the Steadfast. When Faro noticed that Thrawn had failed to report the action against the Grysks and the meeting with the Chiss to Imperial High Command, she took it upon herself to file anonymous reports directly to Grand Moff Tarkin's office to cover her admiral's back in case Ronan decided to accuse him of dealing with aliens."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Faro had to hand over her office to Vanto, while the logistics expert worked through the cargo data from the Stardust shipping operation. Officially Faro was overseeing the study, but in reality she allowed Vanto to work in peace, only occasionally dropping by to see if he had made any progress. In her own study of the same data Faro had barely scratched the surface in the first hour she worked on it, but in less than two hours Vanto had shifted through it all and discovered three systems as likely sources for the stolen cargoes. While Thrawn, Faro and the Chimaera\u2014along with Ar'alani and Chiss Navigator Vah'nya\u2014continued to track the Grysks to their local base, Vanto and Ronan were sent to Aloxor to find proof that the cargo ships had been tampered in order to draw grallocs to them as part of the plot to steal the equipment. In order to protect the secret of Chiss navigation method that utilized the Force, Faro ordered the bridge of the Chimaera to be emptied and the crew to take positions in secondary command center while Vah'nya would take the ship to their enemies. Only Faro, Thrawn and Ar'alani remained on the bridge with the young navigator. To show Ar'alani that he trusted Faro, Grand Admiral Thrawn ordered the commodore to instruct Vah'nya in the use of Chimaera's helm console, after which Faro took over the weapons station in case they would be noticed when they arrived to the Grysk base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Along the way to the base, Faro noticed that the ship's movements felt slightly jerky compared to the usual hyperspace jumps driven by the navigation computers, and the Chiss navigation method also made it difficult to predict when they would arrive to their destination. En route Thrawn explained the background of their mission to Faro, and together they then studied the present and likely future of their encounter with the Grysks. As Thrawn continued to trust important aspects of their mission to her, Faro started to wonder why the Grand Admiral had recommended against her transfer to a command position of her own; if Thrawn thought that she was not yet ready to command a task force, or if the Grand Admiral was simply reluctant to lose his ship's captain, or if she had done something to anger the Chiss people. But none of the reasons she came up with didn't make sense to her. When they arrived to their target system, they found two apparently defenseless Grysk ships waiting, but they suspected that the ships only served as a trap as well as were part of Grysk's communications triad."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the Chimaera waited to receive data from TIE fighters that had been sent to scout the enemy ships, Faro had an opportunity to have a private conversation with Admiral Ar'alani during which she discovered that the Chiss' previously suspicious attitude was starting to turn into respect. When Thrawn decided to engage the Grysk vessels and launched a boarding shuttle in order to draw out the third Grysk ship they suspected to be lurking somewhere near, Faro noticed that the trick was not working so she decided to raise the stakes and declared that she would personally join the boarding party with a second shuttle. While Admiral Ar'alani directly accused Faro of insubordination against Thrawn as she had acted without orders, the Grand Admiral himself merely requested that the commodore explained her actions. Thrawn accepted Faro's reasoning; if they wanted to get the Grysk ship to reveal its location they had to offer an Imperial flag officer as part of their bait, not just a group of stormtroopers. As Faro departed from the bridge of the Chimaera she noticed that the crew, most of who had served with her for years, had gone unusually quiet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To Faro's surprise Chimaera's stormtrooper commander, Major Carvia, was waiting for her in the shuttle, having volunteered to accompany her as well as his own troops that were now in the harm's way. Finally the bait worked and the Grysks revealed their warship's location by drawing in two of the communications triad poles that had been attached to the two conjoined ships. Chimaera's turbolasers made short work of the hidden warship, which allowed the boarding party to continue on to the two remaining ships. On board the Grysk vessels they found all sorts of traps and explosives that the stormtroopers cleared away before Faro and Carvia advanced. Finally they found a group of captive humans along with a Dashade who were guarded by six unknown aliens. Faro attempted to negotiate with the aliens, but Thrawn ordered them to be killed. Only after the deed was done Faro discovered that one of the aliens had a remote that had been set to trigger the explosives that had been packed aboard the conjoined Grysk ships. While Faro was used to facing enemies of the Empire in combat, she found the experience with the boarding party to be considerable different from the one she was used to having on the bridge of a Star Destroyer. She also found the idea that the aliens were willing to die for the Grysks unsettling."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After interrogating the humans rescued from the Grysk ship, Thrawn headed over to see if he could find information from the ships themselves, leaving Faro in charge of the Chimaera.

In order to protect the ships Faro had Chimaera's crew collect all the explosives packed aboard the Grysk vessels to the umbilical tubes connecting them, as well as had the Star Destroyer's garbage was spread around the conjoined ships to create a particle shell that would reveal the presence of additional bombs. Thrawn then trusted the remote controlling the relocated explosives, compressed gas tanks, and triad pole motors that were needed for the operation to Faro, who had overseen most of the preparations. The operation went off without complications despite the unexpected arrival of the Steadfast. The Chiss ship brought unwelcome news that the proof Vanto and Ronan had discovered in Aloxor had fallen into the hands of Grand Admiral Savit and Thrawn would have to return to the Empire in order to recover the Assistant Director and the Brylan Ross, one of the cargo ships that had been tampered to lure the grallocs."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Commodore versus Grand Admiral"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Vanto's report, Thrawn, Faro and Ar'alani considered the situation.

The evidence Vanto had brought back also revealed that it had been Grand Admiral Savit\u2014not their first suspect, Governor Haveland\u2014who had been siphoning cargoes from the Stardust. As the time was critical on both fronts, they decided to leave the Steadfast, supported by a squadron of Thrawn's TIE/D Defenders, to battle against the Grysks, while the Chimaera would confront the traitorous Grand Admiral. Thrawn, who had carefully studied Savit's musical performances, gave Faro detailed instructions and predictions how the battle was going to be handled, stressing to the Commodore that it was essential to prevent loss of life, before taking a group of four pilots and some of his death troopers along in a shuttle to meet with Savit's flagship, the Firedrake."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having given Thrawn a good head start Faro and the Chimaera followed, arriving to the system where they previously had found the Grysk research station to find that, as the Grand Admiral had expected, Savit had brought a total of four Star Destroyers along. Despite the heavy odds against them, Faro demanded that Savit would surrender to her for questioning. As per Thrawn's orders, Faro launched the cloaked Grysk gravity projector toward the Firedrake before sending their proof to the ships of the Third Fleet. She then deployed a squadron of her TIE fighters in a Marg Sabl maneuver as well as four TIEs that were not under power but were sent toward their target using tractor beams. When one of Savit's ships, the Misthunter, opened fire with their ion canons Faro had her gunners fire a return salvo on the same vector, colliding the shots and spending their energy into space at the safe distance from the Chimaera. The second and the third salvo from the Misthunter suffered the same fate, but when Stormbird, another of Savit's ships, also opened ion fire Chimaera's TIEs intercepted the salvo instead. As Savit saw Faro countering an ion volley after ion volley, the Grand Admiral finally ordered the Stormbird to launch TIE fighters, but they didn't fare any better after Faro diabled almost the entire squadron by detonating four proton torpedoes directly in front of them which caused severe shrapnel damage to the fighters.

Thrawn had told her to move the Chimaera to starboard, expecting Savit to turn the Firedrake to match her maneuver which would have led to the cloaked gravity projector impacting on the side of Savit's Star Destroyer. Instead of using his turbolasers, Faro expected Savit to launch some of his own fighter against her, and ordered the Chimaera to move slightly above the plane of battle, goading the Firedrake to pitch upward in response. The slight change in the Firedrake's positioning meant that instead of the ship's side, the cloaked gravity generator hit the hangar bay, damaging the TIE launch racks. Faro was unaware that the group Thrawn had taken with him had already disabled the launch mechanism and minimized the threat of fighters, but not before the TIE pilots Thrawn had brought with him had commandeered four of Savit's TIEs and left the hangar along with Grand Admiral's shuttle. In her broadcast to the other ships of the Third Fleet, Faro explained this departure as Savit's pilots' mutiny against the Grand Admiral's attack on the Chimaera. At that point Savit's fourth ship, the Harbinger, that had so far been sitting well away from the confrontation announced that it would support the Chimaera, and Harbinger's captain, Gilad Pellaeon invited the captains of the Stormbird and the Misthunter to do the same.

Their help, however, turned out not to be necessary since the Steadfast and the TIE Defenders had been victorious, and the Grysks had rather self-destructed their ships than allowed themselves to be captured and interrogated.
