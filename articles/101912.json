According to legend, it was a heavenly garden hidden in the middle of the Nabooian swamps. It was thought that the god of war Balam had built Otoh-D'in to be the final resting places of the souls of the heroic and the virtuous soldiers. In Otoh-D'in, the souls of the braves would live a blessed and happy afterlife, playing strategy games and organizing mock battles. Legend had it that, if the god of destruction Mekamok ever tried to attack Ossorus, the underwater residence of the guds, the legions of brave warriors living in Otoh-D'in would help Balam defend the holy city."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Otoh-D'in was only mentioned in the French edition of the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, in the database entry pertaining to the Gungan society.
