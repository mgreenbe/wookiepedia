Originally peaceful grazers, they evolved into vicious hunters on Mutanda. They were the fastest animals on Mutanda and their ability to quickly change direction by long leaps gave them great advantages when hunting prey. They had four limbs, with thick black and brown hair. The yeat's body was short and sturdy and allowed for great speed. The family unit consisted of a mated pair, with an occasional litter of three to four new pups."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
