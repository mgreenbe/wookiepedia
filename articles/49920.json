The technique allowed a Jedi to create an illusory doppelg\u00e4nger of themselves that could be transmitted through the Force across vast distances."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Force projection required extreme concentration and focus. The Jedi poured their Living Force presence into the Cosmic Force, allowing them to create illusory copies of themselves incredible distances away.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using this power was extremely taxing; Kylo Ren noted that Rey, whose power in the Force rivaled his own immense powers as a Skywalker, would die just by trying. Although Luke Skywalker maintained a projection for several minutes, giving all of himself to the Force to allow him to physically interact with his surroundings, the strain cost him his life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The doppelg\u00e4nger, being only a projection, allowed one to appear to perform seemingly impossible feats, such as being unscathed after taking a barrage of blaster bolts, or disappearing from one position and reappearing in another. It also allowed one to project something other than one's true physical appearance, such as making oneself appear younger, or appearing to have an object not currently in one's possession. Despite being otherwise immaterial, the user was at least capable of physical contact with others."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The power of Force projection originated with the Fallanassi order. In 34 ABY, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker projected his appearance from Ahch-To to Crait, where he confronted his nephew, Kylo Ren, during the Battle of Crait. The feat was so strenuous that it led to Skywalker's death, after which he became one with the Force. He carried a copy of Han Solo's dice with him that he left with General Leia Organa, who left them at the old Rebel base on the planet. Ren discovered the dice, which disappeared shortly after Skywalker's death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker's ability to project himself became known in the wider galaxy after his death, so the story of his stand against tyranny spread hope as the First Order invaded. Though some believed in Skywalker's power, others\u2014such as First Order Commander Branwayne Spiftz\u2014saw it as nothing more than a myth; Spiftz referred to the ability mockingly while chastising Lieutenant Aderat over the \"disappearing\" Minfar resistance fighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Force projection first appeared in Star Wars canon in the 2017 film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, the second installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy.

Instead, he wanted to find a way for Luke to beat Kylo Ren without causing him physical harm. Using the same approach he had employed for Rey and Ren with the Force-bond, he used the Force projection as a way to allow Luke a final, intimate confrontation with Ren."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
