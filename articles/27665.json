After learning of the ice wampa's powerful ferocity during the Battle of Hoth, the Galactic Empire captured several of the creatures, and Imperial biologists artificially adapted them to various environments.

Whereas the ice wampa was covered with a coat of white fur for camouflage on Hoth's frozen plains, the cliff wampa was gray or light brown in color to blend in with the rocky habitat of the Imperial-controlled moon of Gall. The cliff wampa boasted sharp, iron-strong claws capable of climbing or digging through solid rock, much like the Hoth wampa would dig through ice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behavior and intelligence"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like its Hoth cousin, the cliff wampa was semi-sentient in nature.

The Rebels of Echo Base endured repeated assaults on their encampment from Hoth's native wampas. During one such attack, the Rebels neutralized and incarcerated several of the creatures, holding them in secluded pens within the base."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, during the Imperial assault on Echo Base in the Battle of Hoth, several of the Dark Lord Darth Vader's elite snowtroopers were slaughtered by the Rebels' caged wampas after charging blindly into one of the creatures' holding pens inside the base. Imperial biologists were so impressed with the powerful wampa after receiving reports of how the creatures terrorized Echo Base that the Empire managed to capture some of the beasts and, through bioengineering, adapted them to survive in various environments as guard animals. The cliff wampa was a result of the Empire's efforts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Cliff wampas in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 3.5 ABY, just months after the Battle of Hoth, the Empire installed the cliff wampa to guard the Cadavine Sector Fleet Imperial Enclave on the rocky Outer Rim moon of Gall. The mercenary Dash Rendar, who had previously come face-to-face with the Rebels' captured ice wampas within the bowels of Echo Base during the Battle of Hoth, encountered a single cliff wampa while attempting to infiltrate the Imperial Enclave through the high cliffs of Smuggler's Canyon in a failed effort to rescue the captive Han Solo from the bounty hunter Boba Fett."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The cliff wampa was created for the 1996 video game Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire.
