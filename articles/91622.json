Unbeknownst to the Jedi, however, the bounty hunters who had sabotaged the ship had visited the wreckage first, taking three Republic officers who had survived the crash hostage and leaving a booby trap that left Skywalker and Windu trapped in the wreckage. Skywalker's astromech droid, R2-D2, was then forced to evade the bounty hunters and gundarks roaming the crash site in an attempt to call for help and prevent the hunters from finding the Jedi in the ruins of the bridge. R2 was eventually forced to go all the way to Coruscant in Windu's Jedi starfighter for help after the hunters, unaware of the identity of their opponent, destroyed the starfighter's long-range communications. Jedi Master Plo Koon and Skywalker's Padawan Ahsoka Tano returned to Vanqor with the droid and the clone troopers of the 104th Battalion to rescue the trapped Jedi before the Endurance's wreckage completely collapsed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
