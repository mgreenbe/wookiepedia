He and his dark-skinned companion were sent by Nyriss to kill her prisoner\u2014Revan\u2014when her stronghold was attacked by the Imperial Guard. Revan convinced them not to kill him, by pointing out that his friends who were on the way would probably kill them if they found him dead, and promised to protect them. When Meetra Surik, T3-M4, and Lord Scourge arrived, Revan stopped Scourge from killing the two guards. However, Nyriss arrived intent on stopping Revan, Surik, and Scourge from escaping. She killed both guards with her lightning, turning their bodies to charred husks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
