Following the death of Chagras, the ruler of the hegemony, Byllura became the capital of the Dyarchy and was governed by the Sith Lord twins Dromika and Quillan with Saaj Calician serving as its Regent.

In 1040 BBY, Chagras died which sparked a second series of clan warfare among the Sith clan ruling the Grumani sector. At that period, Dromika and Quillan were only five years old. They became rulers of a rump state known as the Dyarchy which was governed on their behalf by their Krevaaki Regent Saaj Calician. They lived on the planet Byllura, residing on a mesa situated above the capital city of Hestobyll."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout her childhood, the twins specialized in using the Force to manipulate their surrounding environment, making all other sentient beings and droids de-facto extensions of their will. From infancy, Dromika had the ability to use Force persuasion to transmit hypnotic commands that would compel her servants to bring her food. With the assistance of Calician, the twin siblings employed a network of Celegians to transmit mental suggestions which enthralled the population of Byllura into functioning like a single living organism. To maintain their control over the Dyarchy, Calician employed a force of red-clad Unifiers to enforce compliance among the population by using Force persuasion. This feat was unparalled elsewhere within the Grumani sector since even Sith Lord Daiman, who regarded himself as the omnipresent Creator of the universe, was unable to exert the same level of direct control over the daily affairs of his subjects."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During their rule, they stayed within their mesa since her Quillan suffered from an powerful farsight ability. The twins communicated with each other through a deep telepathic bond in the Force. Dromika became Quillan's de-facto intercessor but she was also enthralled completely to his will. The twins resided within an enclosed throne room where they were regularly tended by a large retinue of servant droids. Since Quillan perceived living beings as mere phantasm shining radiantly through the Force which blinded his physicial senses, only servant droids were allowed to physically approach the twins. Her twin's Force perceptions were so strong that all other sentient beings had to address them from a dais situated at some distance from their throne. By her teenage years, Dromika was able to use her Force hypnotic powers to turn other sentient beings and droids into mere extensions of her will."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their Regent Calician intended to use the twin siblings' mental Force powers to further his own grandiose ambitions of galactic domination. Calician himself believed that for one Sith to rule the entire galaxy, all other beings had to be constituent parts of the \"self\". Five years before the fall of the Dyarchy in 1032 BBY, Calician himself commissioned the creation of a fleet of fourteen large battlecruisers with a single Force-sensitive Celegian onboard each one that would receive orders directly from Byllura itself. These battleships were constructed within hidden hangars beneath the capital Hestobyll's large reflection pools. By 1032 BBY, this fleet was ready for operations and Calician intended to use them to invade the Daimanate's rearward systems as his first step towards galactic domination."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Jedi Intruder"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Battle of Gazzari, the Jedi Knight Kerra Holt along with the mercenary Jarrow Rusher and several refugee children whom she had rescued on Gazzari traveled on the Diligence to Byllura, while en route to the Galactic Republic. Quillan immediately sense Kerra's presence through the Force and used Dromika to order Calician to monitor the newcomers and \"include\" them into their population. Calician ordered the Celegian known as \"One\" to contact the orbital defense stations and to report the appearance of any strangers immediately. The Diligence was allowed to dock at a landing platform in Hestobyll's spaceport. Upon arrival, \"One\" directed people to move the refugees into a center where they would then be assigned living quarters and then \"integrated\" into the population."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kerra quickly sensed that the entire population of Byllura was being controlled by an unknown force (revealed to be the Celegian \"One\") through Force Persuasion, noting that everyone moved by one accord. In an attempt to save two of charges the Sullustan Tan Tengo and the Duros Beadle Lubboon from being forcibly \"integrated\" into Dyarchy subjects, Kerra quickly started a fight with several Unifiers who were mounted on speeder bikes. Meanwhile, Jarrow and the rest of Rusher's Brigade took on a party of Unifiers attempting to seize control of the Diligence. During the ensuing Battle of Byllura, Kerra pursued Tan and Beadle's captors through the streets of Hestoybyll across the bay into the mesa, where the Force presence controlling the people of Byllura was emanating from. Kerra succeeded in infiltrating The Loft through the airspeeder hangar bay, fighting off several Unifiers along the way."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dromika and Quillan also sensed Kerra's presence through the Force and compelled Calician to destroy the Jedi intruder. Kerra by that stage had realized that the Sith were using Celegians to control the populace through mental suggestions. She infiltrated the chamber where the Celegian \"One\" was being housed within a large transparisteel cylinder at the center of the room. Kerra was able to communicate with \"One\" and convince him to work against his Sith overlords by sending confusing signals to the other Celegians and their charges. She commanded him to order the guards to return to their barracks and then to command another guard to bring the prisoners Tan and Beaddle to the hangar bay. Finally, she ordered \"One\" to order the people of Hestobyll to return to their homes and to stop sending messages for his Sith overlords."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using mental suggestions, Quillan and Dromika ordered Calician to fight with Kerra, leading to a brief lightsaber duel. Throughout the duel, Dromika had a hypnotic grip over Calician, causing him to constantly utter that \"he would destroy the Jedi.\" Calician was able to end the duel by luring Kerra into a turbolift, under the pretext of rescuing her two young charges. Upon arriving up the top floor of the Loft, the twins used mental suggestions to order their nanny droids to attack Kerra, hurtling themselves at the Jedi woman. Kerra entered the half-black dome housing their throne room and confronted the twins. While she initially mistook them for captives, she quickly realized they were the focus of the dark side energy she had felt. They were joined by Calician who introduced Kerra to the Sith twins, explaining their philosophy of including all life under their control. The Regent tried to coerce Kerra into joining the Dyarchy by threatening her with death."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The End of the Dyarchy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having trapped and cornered their first major Jedi enemy, Quillan ordered his sister Dromika to order Kerra to kneel.

The twins used their Force powers to physically bind Calician to his position. As Calician argued with the twins and demanded that they release him, Kerra was able to reignite her lightsaber and then attack the Regent, severing one of his tentacles. She then engaged the twins in a mental battle of using telekinesis to hurl objects across the room."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ensuing duel was interrupted by the arrival of the Diligence which breached through the Lodge. During the fighting, Kerra quickly realized that Quillan was using his sister Dromika as a puppet to carry out his bidding. In the ensuing chaos, Kerra took Quillan hostage and brought him onboard the Diligence, fleeing Dromika who had by then picked up one of Calician's lightsaber-batons. Once aboard the Diligence, Quillan was detained on the nook of the warship's command bridge and guarded by two armed mercenaries. Jarrow also picked up Tan and Beadle from the Loft's hangar bay."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With her brother in captivity, Dromika no longer had commands to relay to their Celegians. Unable to cope with the kidnapping of her twin, Dromika collapsed into a comatose state. Within minutes, the twin's intricate command system on Byllura had also collapsed as the population emerged from their mentally-induced thralldom and rebelled against the Dyarchy. Riots quickly broke out across Byllura's surface including the capital city Hestobyll. This situation was further complicated by the rebellion of the Celegians themselves after \"One\" had successfully convince the others to rebel against their Sith overlords and to cease sending transmissions. Under Quillan and Dromika's rule and Calician's guidance, Byllura had been a model of Sith centralization, with a non-electronic system centered on the will power of one Sith Lord. With Quillan gone, there was nothing but anarchy in the Dyarchy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A desperate Regent Calician contacted Kerra via intercom, explaining the full of extent of the impact of Quillan's kidnapping on the Dyarchy. With Dromika trapped in a coma, Calician tried to get Kerra to kill Quillan in revenge for the slavery he had endured under the latter. In return, Kerra also got Calician to free the captive Celegians. As the Diligence was exiting Byllura's upper atmosphere, the Dyarchy was invaded by a fleet of Arkadianate warships led by their older sibling and Sith Lord Arkadia Calimondra. Arkadia's warfleet quickly neutralized the Dyarchy's battleships and captured the Diligence in their tractor projector."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Wards of the Sith"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of the battle, both Dromika and Quillan was taken into the custody of their older sibiling Akardia. While Quillan was taken by Jarrow and Kerra to Arkadia's capital on Syned, Dromika remained on Byllura at her mountain-top home; being tended by her new Arkadianate guardians. Meanwhile, Arkadianite forces found Calician and executed him, and according to a report received by the Bothan spy Narsk Ka'hane, Calician met his end quietly. Ultimately, Byllura fell and the Dyarchy was subsumed into Arkadia's territories, with its people falling under the rule of another Sith princedom. Arkadia's forces met no significant ground resistance since the Byllurans loathed their Force-induced mental thralldom and Arkadia's policies were considered \"benevolent and enlightened\" by the standards of Sith space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a meeting with Kerra, Jarrow and Narsk, her older sister Arkadia expressed her wishes that the two twins remain separated due to their curious telepathic connection. Since Quillan had completely dominated Dromika throughout much of her life, Arkadia claimed that she wanted to ensure that Dromika would be able to lead a better quality of life away from her brother. However, their elder sister concealed an ulterior desire of wanting to exploit the twin's Force powers for her own advantage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a family Bequest, their grandmother Vilia Calimondra recognized Arkadia's annexation of the former Dyarchy but made arrangements for taking Quillan into her custody. During the Siege of Calimondretta, Narsk foiled a plot by Arkadia to kill Quillan and succeeded in evacuating her twin brother to Vilia Calimondra's empire. Meanwhile, two of Vilia's agents took advantage of this chaos to spirit Dromika away from her Arkadianate captors on Byllura. Thus, guardianship of the twins ultimately passed to their grandmother.

Meanwhile, her twin brother Quillan had a powerful farsight ability that allowed him to accurately see the future in great detail. However, these hypersensitive Force abilities meant that her twin brother constantly suffered from fever, headaches and the need for everyone around him to wear dark colors in order to keep him from hurting. Dromika regularly had to calm her brother down when he experienced these fits. Thus, the twins spent most of their lives on Byllura kept away from everything that could harm them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dromika and Quillan regarded all other agencies outside themselves including both sentient beings and droids as aspects. While the twins were separated physically in body, they were conjoined through the Force which made them almost one inseparable being. Dromika was the only person able to contact her brother since they shared the same Force plane. According to Regent Calician, this mental telepathic Force bond was so strong that no form of science or Sith alchemy could separate them.

Dromika often used this to force other sentients being to carry out her and her twin brother Quillan's bidding. Due to their mind control powers, the siblings succeeded in enthralling the minds of all the inhabitants of Byllura, making the planet's population almost like a single-celled organism completely subservient to their will. Within the sibling relationship, Dromika's own hypnotic powers complemented Quillan's substantial far-sight abilities. Dromika often spoke on behalf of her twin Quillan since the latter dwelled entirely within his expansive mind, viewing other living beings as mere phantasms in his dream world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike most other Sith however, Dromika and her twin brother lacked any discernible combat skills since they preferred to act through their environment, using other beings as mere extensions of their will.
