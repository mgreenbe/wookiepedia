Dur Gejjen was its elected representative. It was created in opposition to Thrackan Sal-Solo's party and it was hoped that they would be able to throw him out of office so as to ease tensions between the Corellian system and the rest of the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances. After the assassination of Sal-Solo, however, the Democratic Alliance took control of Corellia and effectively did a complete reversal of earlier goals, refusing to have talks with the Galactic Alliance. The party would later play a part in the plan to draw the Hapes Consortium into the war on Corellia's side. After the assassination of Gejjen, three party officials formed the Triumvirate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
