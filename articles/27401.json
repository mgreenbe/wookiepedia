Invented by the fatalists of Plootark IX, it caused the atomic\ndeletion of its target, breaking its chemical bonds. Since Class-D annihilation specifically targeted midi-chlorians, matter thus eradicated was said to disappear even from detection in the Force. For that reason, the Jedi Order regarded Class-D annihilation as the ultimate affront to life and the Living Force. By the time of the Clone Wars, Class-D devices were outlawed under\ngalactic law."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
