Based on BlasTech Industries' Firespray DL-87 stun rifle, the Deck Sweeper only fired on the stun setting and had no lethal option. The Deck Sweeper was designed to stun a large number of targets at once; the wide barrel at the front of the weapon fired in a forty-five degree arc with a range up to ten meters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Deck Sweeper was sold exclusively to law enforcement agencies and military forces for use by customs boarding parties and riot control police. Civilian possession of the weapon was illegal, but it was favoured by pirates and privateers as a boarding weapon.The Galactic Empire rejected the Deck Sweeper for Imperial Navy use, citing the weapon's short range and slow rate of fire. The bulky size of the weapon was also a factor, with Imperial commanders believing they were impractical for stormtroopers and marines."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
