She was interrogating the Jedi about intel he knew. When the Lannik refused to talk, the droid was moving to remove Piell's good eye using its needle, but a team of Jedi and clone troopers that were sent to rescue the Jedi Master, burst in. During the rescue, the droid watched as its fellow droids shot by the clone troopers. Captain \"Rex\" blasted the droid through the head and with a final scream of pain, it toppled to the ground, and its red photoreceptors went out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
