The gravitic pressure bandage instead treated internal bleeding, by applying micro-repulsor fields of differing strengths and sensitivities applied from multiple angles, stopping bleeding from arteries and compressing selected cell walls without effecting other tissues. In appearance, the gravitic bandage looked like an adjustable band lined with inflatable cloth lining, and was affordable at only 750 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
