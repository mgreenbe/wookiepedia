All three brothers survived an attack against the Jedi Academy on the planet Ossus by the One Sith in 130 ABY, with the Jedi Order being dispersed across the galaxy. Seven years later, Tuum traveled to the planet Daluuj to rendezvous with Jedi Master Wolf Sazen, Jedi Knight Shado Vao, and a Human female Jedi. As Tuum and the group were discussing the possibility of searching for Sazen's former Padawan Cade Skywalker, a group of Sith revealed themselves by impaling Ahn with a spear and throwing him from the bridge where the meeting was taking place into a ravine, killing the Cathar.

Unbeknownst to Tuum and his fellow Jedi, a team of five Sith were hiding in the shadows, preparing to ambush the four Jedi.

However, that did not stop him from agreeing to go with Shado Vao and meet with Wolf Sazen on Daluuj. At the beginning of the meeting with Sazen, Tuum expressed his doubts about meeting with each other. He also opined that the Zabrak's former Padawan, Cade Skywalker, was deceased and refused to believe Sazen when he insisted that Skywalker was alive. Tuum wore a brown set of Jedi robes and allowed his long brown hair to flow past his shoulders. His eyes were green, and he also sported a necklace.

He was first featured, along with his brothers, in an image in the resource comic Star Wars: Legacy 0. Because Ahn's character perished in the series' second issue, the authors of The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia used Ahn's biography in their entry for the character of Rasi Tuum. However, Legacy's twenty-fifth issue, which was released a few months before The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, revealed that Rasi Tuum and Ahn were two separate individuals. The issue established \"Rasi Tuum\" as Ahn's family name, but so far, no source has indicated in which order his family and given names should be placed. Ahn Rasi Tuum was penciled by Duursema in both the resource comic and Broken, Part 2."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
