They built two 1.5 meter high ferroconcrete barricades, with a gap in the middle that was guarded by three AT-RTs. It was a serious obstacle to the Nizon resistance, as it prevented their two largest groups from connecting. A team of Alderaanian Resistance agents attacked it, to try and help them break through."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
