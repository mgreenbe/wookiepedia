Marketed toward law enforcement and intelligence agencies, the NightStalker combined light-absorbing materials, armorweave, gel-insert plates, and sound dampening fabric in order to produce a suit that provided both respectable protection and decent passive stealth capabilities. It was a full-body suit that covered everything but the wearer's eyes, and was typically worn with scanner goggles or other wearable vision-enhancement systems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mk I NightStalker Infiltration Suit was first mentioned in Cyphers and Masks, an adventure supplement to Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars: Age of Rebellion roleplaying game, which was released in 2018."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
