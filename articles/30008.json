It consisted in putting the ship into a slow left-hand roll when maneuvering under fire or when making an approach in traffic. Because of the single high-mounted rectenna he had added to his YT-1300, the Millennium Falcon, the Corellian pilot Han Solo needed to use the carousel very often, since the dish had an even larger blind spot than normal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
