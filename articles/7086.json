He later used it to force a Drexl to his command, and used it to fly from Dxun straight to Onderon and fight a group of beast riders while riding it. The Twi'lek Jedi Tott Doneeta also used this ability to befriend a vicious boma in his quest to find Princess Galia on the planet Onderon. He rode the creature into the Beast Riders' base before he, Ulic Qel-Droma, and his brother Cay Qel-Droma learned the truth about Queen Amanoa. Kreia taught this power to the Jedi Exile when they were both stranded on Dxun as a means to make their journey through the jungles easier."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Qui-Gon Jinn managed to influence a draigon so that he could come to the rescue of his would-be Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and later a kudana while escaping a stampede.

During these battles, Shaak Ti controlled the Felucian Ancient Abyss, which was itself a massive sarlacc, while Maris controlled a bull rancor. The Felucians themselves controlled several other dangerous creatures on Felucia, including rancors, although it is unknown whether this control stemmed from their natural connection to the Force or if it was due to basic domestication of these beasts, as was the case with the Nightsisters of Dathomir."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jacen Solo frequently used this power on various animals on Yavin 4 during his time at the Jedi Praxeum.
