During Xoddam Lothipp's tenure as Deputy Director, a restoration effort was started and a task force led by archive droid TR-33NA was assembled to scour the library for artifacts of historical importance. One of their first significant discoveries, deep within the stacks, was an old journal filled with sketches and accounts of alien species and cultures from all over the galaxy. Although the author was not easy to identify, the drawing style of the sketches was reminiscent of Gammit Chond."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
