The fight took place at a complex of cave dwellings that had formerly been inhabited by the Fuzzums but which the Starhunters were using as cages for the beasts they used aboard their Starhunter's Intergalactic Menagerie. While the Fuzzums attacked a patrol droid with their spears on the ground level, the droid R2-D2, the Tammuz-an prince Coby, and the old spacer Greej attacked another patrol droid on a higher level of caves. The Fuzzums and their allies managed to incapacitate the droids, and the skirmish was thought to be over. However, the Starhunters arrived on the scene and tussled with Greej and the others over the only blaster present. When they secured the weapon, they began to make their escape. The timely arrival of a miner named Jann Tosh stopped them in their tracks and won the day for the Fuzzums. As a result of the battle, the Starhunters were arrested, their animals came under the care of Greej and Coby, and the Fuzzums reclaimed their former homes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
