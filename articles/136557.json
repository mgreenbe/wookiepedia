She lost most of her teeth while trying to bite through her chains. Since Cracktooth was submissive, Tolruck used her as his personal servant and gardener. She and her fellow Wookiees on the planet Kashyyyk were fitted with inhibitor chips which kept them in line. After Sinjir Rath Velus deactivated the inhibitor chips' control module during the liberation of Kashyyyk, Cracktooth exacted revenge on her former master Tolruck and broke his neck."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and appearances"}]}
