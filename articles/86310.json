During a routine mission, the commander would give the order to fly \"Maneuver 717\" and the loyal pilots would allow the suspected spy to head the squad. Once the spy was unable to see the other ships, they would fire on the spy and destroy his or her ship. It would later be claimed that the spy had been cut down by enemy fire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
