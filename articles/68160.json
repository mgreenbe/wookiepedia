The E-5's design scaled poorly, however, with its minor heating issues becoming a major problem for the J-10. The dual blaster cannon glitchy Galven pattern programming often led to power fluctuations. In addition, inferior-quality materials contributed to poor accuracy, with imperfections in the J-10's focusing crystals causing shots to drift without regular maintenance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The J-10 used by the Separatist Droid Army during the Clone Wars. Like most of their equipment, it was produced on unregulated, droid-run assembly lines in factories where quantity was more important than quality. It was rarely deployed due to its many drawbacks, with scavengers frequently having discovered pristine caches of J-10s, as did Alliance to Restore the Republic scouts while searching for new locations to establish hidden bases during the Galactic Civil War. Many J-10s found their ways into the hands of the Rebel Alliance and became common in their outposts, where they could be deployed along trenches to cover evacuations in the event of discovery by the Galactic Empire. Alliance technicians often opted to replace faulty J-10s instead of fixing them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
