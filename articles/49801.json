It was usually semi-transparent with a blue or green hue, where as the Sith variant had a reddish shade. The sphere of Force energy sought out its intended target with the utmost accuracy and speed. This technique could be nullified by Force protection, Protection bubble, or set off course by a strong Force push, or even dissipated with another Force Burst. However, it was usually deflected by a well-timed Force shield. A similar dark-side Force ability identical to this ability is known as Force Destruction, where the user would unleash a Force energy using their body as a conduit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi used this technique in the PlayStation game, Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
