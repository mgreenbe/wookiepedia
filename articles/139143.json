They had many non-Tai'ni workers on their homeworld, including Trintic and Leresai. In 19 ABY, the Tai'ni government invited General Garm Bel Iblis to mediate a dispute between the Tai'ni and their non-Tai'ni workers. This turned out to be a ploy orchestrated by their allies, the Bothans, to get General Bel Iblis's forces (including Rogue Squadron) into the region to help protect Bothawui."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
