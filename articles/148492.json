The assassin then headed for the detention level, where she faced off against Tano and the senate commandos. Knocking out the commandos, including Argyus, she managed to free Gunray whilst imprisoning Tano in Gunray's cell, only for Unduli and Gree to return having dispatched the droid invaders.

Not long after, Ventress managed to trap Unduli underneath some metal pipes - but as she prepared to deliver the final blow, Tano arrived having decided that Unduli would need her help against Ventress. With both Jedi occupied, Ventress activated a signal which sent Argyus, who remained with Gunray, Gree and the other commandos, into action. Argyus gunned down his two fellow commandos and freed Gunray, using the Neimoidian as a shield as he was fired upon by Gree.
