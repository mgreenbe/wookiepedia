Although the company manufactured its products in the Amorphiia system, by 1 ABY, the items were available in other regions of the galaxy. That year, the Wookiee Lumpawarrump constructed one of this company's mini-transmitters on the planet Kashyyyk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each mini-transmitter shipped with a bag of tools, a circuit-breaker module, an impulse-to-voice translator, and an instruction cassette to explain the assembly process. This cassette was hosted by a male Amorphiian named Dromboid. Despite his best efforts, Dromboid's tendency to speed up and slow down erratically, common to his species, proved frustrating to Lumpwarrump. Nevertheless, the announcement preceding the instructional cassette insisted that the host's malfunctions did not affect the product itself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mini-transmitter company is mentioned in The Star Wars Holiday Special, a television variety show that aired on CBS in 1978.
