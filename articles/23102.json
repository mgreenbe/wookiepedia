Raised on the planet Yuvern in the Oplovis sector, Adiss constantly dreamed of traveling across the galaxy as a pilot, much to the dismay of his parental collective. Upon his coming of age, Adiss signed on with the trader Kal'Falnl C'ndros. Under C'ndros's tutelage, Adiss became a skilled pilot, and the pair eventually parted ways on the desert world of Tatooine. Hoping to change his own destiny and purchase a ship of his own, he boastfully advertised his \"expertise\" to a crime lord named Jabba, and landed a job in the Hutt's criminal empire as a smuggler."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To his disappointment, his first job took him to Yuvern. Arriving in-system, he was met with the sight of the entire Imperial Oplovis sector fleet. Adiss was issued orders to heave to and receive inspectors, and he complied\u2014but as the inspectors were proceeding through the ship, an Alliance battle line entered the system and engaged the Imperials. The Imperials, forced to retreat, departed the system, leaving the inspectors on Adiss's ship. Fortunately for the smuggler, the battle distracted the inspectors, and the spice he was shipping remained undiscovered. Dropping the inspectors off at Harrod's Planet, Adiss promised to be on the lookout for Alliance activity, before returning to Jabba. In 4 ABY, he was present at the Battle of the Great Pit of Carkoon, and was on board the Khetanna when it was destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life and career"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cane Adiss was raised on Yuvern, a world located in the Oplovis sector. Even when he was young, he believed that he belonged in space among the stars, not on the mundane world of Yuvern. He aspired to become a pilot, much to the disappointment of his parental collective. When he came of age, he was given an opportunity to leave his homeworld when the Quor'sav trader Kal'Falnl C'ndros visited Yuvern."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike most light freighters, C'ndros's ship, the Shelltooth, was large enough to accommodate Yuvernians, since it had been modified for the tall Quor'sav. C'ndros took Adiss under her wing, and with the trader's tutelage, the young Yuvernian developed strong piloting skills. The pair visited dozens of worlds across the galaxy, and around 0 BBY, he was at the Power Dive cantina on Ord Mantell. Eventually, C'ndros and Adiss split up on Tatooine."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Working for Jabba"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Adiss once again felt the need to travel the stars, and hoped to captain his own ship. Spacecraft were expensive, however, and Adiss did not have the funds needed to purchase one, especially one big enough to accommodate a Yuvernian. To remedy the situation, he contacted Jabba Desilijic Tiure, head of a substantial criminal empire who resided on Tatooine. To get Jabba's attention, he boastfully claimed that he had traveled to every uncharted planet in the galaxy, much to the crime lord's amusement. Jabba loaned Adiss the necessary credits on the provision that he work for the Hutt. The Yuvernian agreed, and began work as a spice smuggler."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To his dismay, Adiss's first job took him to his homeworld of Yuvern, where he was to deliver a shipment of spice. Further disappointment came in the form of the Imperial Oplovis sector fleet, the sight of which greeted the smuggler when he arrived in the Yuvern system. Before he could depart, he was ordered to standby and receive Imperial inspectors, or be destroyed. With little choice but to comply, Adiss waited as the inspectors boarded his ship and began searching for any hidden contraband. Fortunately for the smuggler, a contingent of Alliance to Restore the Republic ships entered the system and began engaging the Imperials. The sector fleet was overwhelmed and forced to retreat to Harrod's Planet, leaving the inspectors stranded on Adiss's ship. One of the officers ordered the smuggler to ferry them to Harrod's Planet; Adiss once again had little choice but to obey, although he was paid for his work."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The confusion of the battle had distracted the inspectors from their task, leaving the spice Adiss was smuggling undiscovered. Dropping the inspectors off at Harrod's Planet with a minimum of fuss, Adiss agreed to look out for any signs of Alliance activity, before successfully returning to Yuvern and completing his smuggling run. He continued to work for Jabba, relishing the smuggler's lifestyle and meeting any dangers he faced with enthusiasm. To get around Jabba's Palace, he was forced to use the Hutt's private elevator, as it was the only one big enough to fit him."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Fiasco"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Adiss was returning from a smuggling run in 4 ABY when Leia Organa, disguised as the Ubese bounty hunter Boushh, \"delivered\" the Wookiee Chewbacca to Jabba as part of an attempt to rescue the captive Han Solo from the Hutt's clutches. Adiss's life, along with all the others in Jabba's courtroom, was thrown into jeopardy when Organa produced a thermal detonator and activated it, in the hopes of getting a higher price from Jabba. Organa succeeded, and deactivated the detonator, much to everyone's relief."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Adiss stayed at Jabba's palace for the next few days, witnessing Luke Skywalker's attempt to retrieve Solo, and his subsequent capture. Adiss went, along with most of Jabba's court on the sail barge Khetanna, to the Great Pit of Carkoon to witness the execution of Skywalker, Solo, and Chewbacca. Unfortunately for Jabba, the captives were able to turn the tables on the Hutt's men. As a result, the Khetanna was destroyed by Organa, with Adiss on board. It was unknown whether he could escape the barge's destruction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cane Adiss had always aspired to be among the stars, and would constantly have his dual heads turned to Yuvern's skies, despite the wishes of his parental collective. Transport was usually difficult for the nearly five-meter-long Adiss, and as a result there were few freighters he could actually travel in. He was known to make wild boasts to secure money for himself, as he did when trying to get a loan from Jabba. Adiss found his own homeworld to be mundane, and was disappointed when he was forced to revisit it while working for Jabba. Nevertheless, his taste for adventure kept him in the smuggling business, and he remained in the Hutt's employ for several years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Adiss was a Yuvernian male with black hair and blue eyes.

During production, he was referred to as \"Cane Heads.\" The 1997 reference book Star Wars: Chronicles incorrectly states that the character did not make the final cut of the film, although he can be seen in at least two shots. He was given the name \"Cane Adiss\" in the 1998 Jabba's Palace Limited set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game. Employees at Decipher, while creating the Adiss trading card, replaced one of the spots on the character's neck with a map of Virginia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Adiss was the subject of StarWars.com's Hyperspace feature, \"What's The Story?,\" where his backstory was developed by John Hazlett, who wrote under the name \"jSarek.\" He expanded upon scenarios and elements presented in the Jabba's Palace Limited set and Inside the Worlds of Star Wars Trilogy. Hazlett also tied the character to such disparate elements as Kal'Falnl C'ndros from 1977's Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope and Yuvern from 1990's The Rebel Alliance Sourcebook. Initially, Hazlett killed off the character at the end of his \"What's the Story?\" entry, but this was edited to be more ambiguous by the StarWars.com staff. Notably, \"Who's Who in Jabba's Palace\", an article published in Star Wars Insider 60, listed Adiss as deceased. However, because its publication predated the Databank entry listing his fate as unknown, this article assumes the information from \"Who's Who in Jabba's Palace\" was overwritten by the latter source."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
