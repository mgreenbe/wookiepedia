More than 500,000 credits worth of refinements turned Storm into a powerful starfighter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship was just over seven meters long, smaller even than the New Republic's RZ-1 A-wing interceptor. This required Hapan engineers to miniaturize many components to make them fit inside the small ship. Isolder commonly flew with a prototype R2-Series5 astromech droid, a gift from Princess Leia Organa during the first negotiations between the New Republic and the Hapes Consortium."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Storm was equipped with three Taibolt 12 anticoncussion-field generators for defense, and was armed with a cluster of triple-linked laser cannons and a miniconcussion-missile launcher with 10 custom-built missiles. Each wing sported an ion cannon, complemented by twin thermal-detonator bombing tubes with a total of 16 thermal detonators."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Directly in front of the transparisteel canopy was a communication and sensor jammer very similar to that of the A-wing. This device allowed Isolder to block target locks and communications from enemy fighters. Storm's concussion missile system was equipped with a sophisticated targeting system that allowed them to overcome jamming."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The starfighter's four Incom 6X4 fusial thrust engines were modified with Tykannin Class-4 power converters.
