Urhal held the rank of commander, and was stationed on the Republic warship Halleck. In 21 BBY, Urhal was a commander on the cruiser Halleck in Haruun Kal's orbit during the battle there. When a squadron of droid fighters attacked the Halleck, Trent, the commander of the vessel, was injured, and Urhal took over as the commanding officer of the ship. Under the orders of Jedi Master Mace Windu, Urhal deployed the Halleck's complement of landers and gunships, then ordered the vessel to evacuate the system, though he questioned the logic of Windu's orders beforehand."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Urhal first appeared, albeit over comlink, in Matthew Stover's 2003 novel Shatterpoint."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
