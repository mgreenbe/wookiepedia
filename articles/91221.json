Unbeknownst to the Council, Sifo-Dyas had been sent on a secret mission to Oba Diah to negotiate with the Pyke Syndicate by Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum. Sifo-Dyas, accompanied by the Chancellor's aide Silman, departed the negotiations for Felucia, but was assassinated by the Pykes on the request of a man they knew as \"Tyranus\", secretly the former Jedi Count Dooku, who had, unbeknownst to the Order, fallen to the dark side and become a Sith Lord and the apprentice of the Dark Lord Darth Sidious, publicly Naboo Senator Sheev Palpatine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dooku and Sidious wished Sifo-Dyas dead in order to take control of the clone army Sifo-Dyas had secretly ordered from the cloners of the remote planet Kamino, as he had foreseen a war coming that would require the Galactic Republic to have an army. Dooku then travelled to Felucia and deceived the tribal elders into thinking that Sifo-Dyas was still alive and that he was another Jedi who had accompanied him.
