Artifacts of the Brodihi were recovered by the Chiss in a wrecked starship and displayed in an art gallery. After analyzing the artifacts, which included Brodihi dinnerware, the Chiss Mitth'raw'nuruodo deduced that the species had some sort of social hierarchy, and that they used their outer rim of teeth as a weapon, with an inner set of teeth behind which their taste receptors were located. Thrawn also deduced that the Brodihi would prefer short-range combat and consider long-range weaponry secondary or even dishonorable."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
