It allowed the wielder to activate their lightsaber using the Force. As a result, this removed the activation button from the lightsaber's hilt. This was done to prevent non-Force-users from activating the lightsaber. Because of the Infinite Empires' utilization of the Dark Side, their Forcesabers could only be used when one draws on only the Dark Side of the Force as their center of power to activate their weapons, making it difficult for outsiders that are Force-Sensitive to activate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
