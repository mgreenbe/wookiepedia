Many were pressed into service while others joined out of economic necessity. The Imperial factory workers at the Imperial Armory Complex on Lothal wore bright orange overalls. Some wore protective headgear and filter masks. One known factory worker was the former farmer Morad Sumar, who was a member of Ryder Azadi's Lothal resistance group. Morad deliberately sabotaged vehicles that were produced for the Imperial Military. In 2 BBY, the rebels Ezra Bridger and Kanan Jarrus disguised themselves as factory workers during a mission to steal Grand Admiral Thrawn's plans for the TIE Defender initiative."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
