It operated on the Hydian Way and on one occasion, lured the Action IV transport Azure Queen to the edge of an asteroid, where it ambushed the transport. The Strike jammed the Queen's hyperwave transmitter, then fired on it, leaving it stranded and bringing the transport's hyperdrive off-line. A Black Sun boarding crew was sent over from the Strike to the Queen and took control of the transport, then began repairing the hyperdrive. However, the Republic sent an ILH-KK Citadel-class cruiser to recapture the Azure Queen, and it ambushed the Cutting Strike."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
