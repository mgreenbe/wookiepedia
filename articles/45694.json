Through her time with the queen, Verlaine learned much about the culture and heritage of her homeworld and formed a life-long respect for both the queen and House of Organa. She became a committed royalist, believing in the Alderaanian monarchy, and followed in the footsteps of the planet's leaders by joining the Alliance to Restore the Republic.

The destruction, known to Alderaanian survivors as \"the Disaster,\" was carried out by the Death Star, the Empire's deep space mobile battle station, and led to the death of Queen Organa and her husband, Viceroy Bail Organa, one of the founders of the Rebel Alliance. The Rebels gained a quick victory, however, when Princess Leia Organa, the queen's adoptive daughter, brought the stolen Death Star plans to Yavin 4. Once the plans were analyzed and a weakness in the station was discovered, a small fleet of Rebel starfighters launched the Battle of Yavin and destroyed the Death Star. Verlaine participated in the battle as Gold Three of Gold Squadron, alongside seven other Y-wings led by Jon \"Dutch\" Vander. As Verlaine attempted to make her way back to the Yavin moon, her Y-wing was targeted by the TIE fighter of Senior Lieutenant Iden Versio, but the rebel pilot was able to successfully make her way back to the base, unlike the rest of her squadron."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Mission with Princess Leia"}, {"tag": "h5", "text": "Leaving Yavin"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Yavin, only a small group of the initial task force returned.

Verlaine was in attendance at the ceremony. After the medals were presented, Organa said a few words in remembrance of her parents and her homeworld. Her words were measured and lacked emotion, leading some of the assembled Rebels to refer to her as the \"ice princess.\" When the ceremony ended, Verlaine remained behind and paid her respects to Queen Organa and Viceroy Organa at a memorial statue."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because the Empire learned of the location of the Rebel base before the Battle of Yavin, Rebel General Jan Dodonna ordered the evacuation of the Great Temple. Verlaine and some of her fellow Rebels packed supplies in the base's hangar that would be loaded into the Rebel fleet that arrived at Yavin 4. While working, she and another Rebel discussed Organa's cold demeanor. The princess overheard them and approached, at which point the other Rebel quickly left, leaving Organa and Verlaine to talk on their own. Verlaine explained her loyalty to House of Organa and to the late queen, and she pledged her service to the princess, despite her initial reservations about how the princess was handling her duties in the aftermath of Alderaan's destruction. Verlaine also told Organa about rumors suggesting that the Empire was hunting down all surviving Alderaanians, rumors that Verlaine believed. Between Verlaine's concerns about Organa's leadership and the rumors, Organa decided to leave the Rebel base without a Rebel escort, in defiance of General Dodonna's orders, and find the surviving Alderaanians to protect them. Verlaine agreed to go with her in order to preserve their planet's culture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Verlaine, Organa, and the astromech droid R2-D2, left Yavin 4 aboard a T-1 shuttle, which Verlaine piloted. Before they left, Organa sent a holographic recording to General Dodonna informing him of why she had to leave the Rebel base in violation of his orders. Verlaine disagreed with sending the message as she believed it would lead the Rebels to send their forces to stop them from leaving, a concern that was proven right when Skywalker and Wedge Antilles\u2014the only two members of Red Squadron who survived the Battle of Yavin\u2014intercepted the shuttle and ordered them to turn back. Verlaine and Artoo quietly worked out a strategy in which they would lead the X-wing pilots to believe that they had intercepted the shuttle and then release a part of the ship that the pilots would believe was an important part of the hyperdrive, but that was in actuality a decoy. They did not tell the princess, as the pilots were listening into their conversations. Organa was irate once the plan was enacted, believing that Verlaine had recklessly compromised the mission by damaging the ship when it struck Antilles' X-wing. However, when the fighters backed off to avoid the presumed damage, Verlaine jumped the ship into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h5", "text": "Trouble on Naboo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the ship was safely in hyperspace, Verlaine admitted to the princess that the maneuver was a trick. Organa thanked her for her efforts and the two made their way towards the planet Naboo. During the voyage, Organa and Verlaine briefly debated the latter's role in the princess' mission, with Organa making it clear that she wanted Verlaine to be an accomplice rather than a servant. Once the shuttle arrived over Naboo, Artoo sent out a signal that falsely identified them as Imperial auditors, as Organa believed that no authorities would question them due to not wanting to interact with auditors. Verlaine was skeptical of the plan, as there was a bounty on the princess' head and Naboo was the homeworld of the Emperor, Sheev Palpatine. Organa felt it important to try anyway as there was a cloister of Alderaanian musicians known as Melodic Order living on the planet, and she believed that the Empire would start the eradication of surviving Alderaanians with that particular group."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The shuttle landed at a dock in Theed, the capital city of Naboo. Organa identified herself under a false name, First Minister Solo, and demanded that all fees be charged to the Imperial Advisor's Office. Verlaine questioned this approach, wondering if it would have been simpler to pay cash credits and avoid attracting Imperial attention, but Organa told her that they did not have any money on them and would instead have live by their wits. The princess abruptly stopped talking upon seeing a mural of the late Padm\u00e9 Amidala, who served as Queen of Naboo and later as its Senator during the Clone Wars.

Organa introduced Verlaine to the man, and the Rebel pilot was cautious about the encounter, particularly with the princess having taken off the hood that had been obscuring her face from those who might have recognized her. Junn led the group to his palace, where he revealed that he knew why Verlaine and Organa were on Naboo and offered to put them into contact with the owner of Club Deeja, Mul Sanaka, where Melodic Order performed via hologram. Junn left the area to speak with Sanaka and quietly inform him of the princess' identity, and Verlaine took the opportunity to make her suspicions known and tell the princess that she was still worried about the bounty on Organa's head. Organa pressed Verlaine to trust her, but the pilot still had her doubts. When Junn returned, he told them that he had been in contact with Sanaka and that they could proceed to the club."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Verlaine and Organa made their way to Club Deeja in the Marina District of the city Keren. Their arrival attracted considerable attention and concern amongst the locals, who believed it to be an Imperial shuttle. Verlaine and Organa attempted to enter the club but were stopped by Sanaka, who claimed to believe that Organa was First Minister Solo and was there to collect the Alderaanians for the Empire. Snes, the club guard, forced them to hand over their weapons, at which point he revealed that he knew who Organa really was and ordered Verlaine and the princess to enter the club. Rather than comply, the princess attacked Snes, leading to a brawl in the club's entrance between Verlaine, Organa, and the guards. The two took out the guards and Sanaka nearly shot the princess, before a fellow Alderaanian, Uwa Pareece, knocked him unconscious and revealed that she too knew who the princess was."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pareece, who had kept the news of the Disaster from the collective of Alderaanians she protected, led Verlaine and Organa into the club.

There, they were taken to Preserver Jora Astane. Astane was at first suspicious that the princess was going to turn them to the Empire but Organa told her about her ship in orbit and how they were rescuing Alderaanian survivors. Astane ordered Clovis to scan the ship, ignoring Veraine's comment to trust their princess. As Astane toured them the Enclave, they got into an argument. Verlaine accused Astane of being a hypocrite and ravaging what was left of Alderaan's culture. Their conversation was interrupted by the replay of a transmission between Lord Junn and an Imperial cruiser. Verlaine and Organa realized that there was a traitor in their midst aboard the ship but Astane accused them of being traitors, as they found out that the cruiser had entered the orbit.

The squadron was tasked with finding the scattered divisions of the Rebel Alliance fleet following the Battle of Hoth, to warn them that the Galactic Empire had cracked Alliance communications and to deliver a new Trawak code that C-3PO and his team had developed. During their search, the squadron discovered wreckage of the Sixth Division near Felucia and encountered Imperial probe droids waiting nearby. The probe droids latched onto the astromechs of the X-wings and attempted to access their archives. Fearing the probe droids getting the other rendezvous points, Wedge Antilles suggested shooting them off, however Shara Bey (Starlight Leader) questioned their ability to actually pull it off. Instead, Bey ordered all pilots to set their astromech's self-destruct and eject them. However, doing this meant losing their nav data and getting back home. With no other choice, the droids ejected and detonated, saving their valuable data from the Empire.
