Through the influence of the ruling Aristocra and the Chiss Academy, Chiss society considered pre-emptive strikes taboo. The law was in place 1000 years prior to 36 ABY and was one of the central tenets of Chiss society."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Chiss Mitth'raw'nuruodo, known as Thrawn, violated the law in 27 BBY, when he destroyed the Republic starship Outbound Flight. Thrawn convinced the ruling Chiss families to allow him to retain his position, although he had still created enemies for himself. After violating the law again in another conflict Thrawn was stripped of his rank and exiled to a planet on the edge of Imperial territory, where he was collected by Voss Parck."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 36 ABY Luke Skywalker considered the possibility that the Chiss Ascendancy had rejected the law in response to changing galactic circumstances, causing the Swarm War with the Killik Colony. Jacen Solo, aware of the Chiss policy on preemptive strikes, attempted to frame the attack of a Chiss supply depot at Thrago on the Killiks, hoping to incite a Chiss counterstrike."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Chiss law against first strikes was first mentioned in the novel Vision of the Future, written by Timothy Zahn and published in 1998 by Bantam Spectra. The law has a similar precedent in real-world political theory called the non-aggression principle, a fundamental axiom in individualist philosophy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
