Known for her unconventional strategy and eccentric style, she was an early participant in the rebellion against the Galactic Empire and a lifelong friend and ally to rebel leader Leia Organa of Alderaan. In the early days of the First Order/Resistance War, Holdo became the commanding officer of the Resistance fleet as it fled the overwhelming might of the First Order Navy. Her leadership in that role saved the Resistance and many of its heroes when she executed a historic suicide attack on the First Order fleet, later dubbed the Holdo maneuver."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A native of the planet Gatalenta, Amilyn Holdo had an early career in public service as a delegate to the Imperial Apprentice Legislature program. During her term, Holdo was notably critical of oppressive Imperial policy and developed a close relationship with the like-minded Alderaanian Princess Leia Organa. Through Organa, she became involved in the operations of the insurgent Rebel Alliance in opposition to the Empire during the Galactic Civil War. Although she initially served as a civil minister, Holdo proved herself as a capable martial commander and was granted an officer's commission in the Alliance Fleet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Decades after the Alliance's victory over the Empire, Holdo was again recruited by Organa\u2014this time to join her paramilitary Resistance movement against the rise of the neo-Imperial First Order. Holdo served then-General Organa during the Cold War as a vice admiral of the Resistance fleet, undertaking clandestine missions to prepare for open war. After the war erupted in 34 ABY, Resistance High Command was decimated, leaving Holdo as the highest ranking officer in charge of the remaining Resistance forces as they fled from the pursuing First Order armada and its mobile headquarters, the Supremacy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unable to escape into hyperspace and low on fuel, the remaining Resistance personnel consolidated under Holdo's command aboard the flagship star cruiser Raddus. Holdo's singular focus on escape was controversial among some younger soldiers like Captain Poe Dameron, but the vice admiral successfully led the Resistance to the mineral world of Crait, where she intended to sneak the survivors to the surface aboard cloaked transports. Due to an information leak during an attempted mutiny, the First Order ascertained her plan and destroyed nearly all of the Resistance transports. In a stunning act of sacrifice, Holdo saved the Resistance from complete obliteration by jumping the Raddus directly into the First Order fleet, resulting in a lightspeed collision that destroyed the Resistance flagship, the Supremacy, and twenty Star Destroyers. Holdo's actions allowed the remnants of the Resistance to escape, ensuring the continuation of an organized opposition to the First Order's fascist regime."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rebellious youth"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amilyn Holdo was human female born on the planet Gatalenta in the Core Worlds around the early days of the Galactic Empire's reign. As a child, she enjoyed spelunking and high-speed tobogganing, and she became a skilled practitioner of the Gatalentan calisthenics practice skyfaring. The young Holdo also studied astrology, public service, and philosophy. She found herself at odds with Gatalentan aesthetics and traditions of simplicity and tranquility, instead embracing eccentricities and seeking out danger."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 BBY, Holdo was set to represent Gatalenta in the Apprentice Legislature, a junior deliberative program in the Empire to train youth in politics on the Imperial capital world of Coruscant. In the lead-up to their first legislative session, Holdo and several other members of the Apprentice Legislature were invited by Queen Breha Organa of Alderaan to participate in a pathfinding class, wherein students would learn survival techniques through challenging expeditions in natural environments. Holdo's first pathfinding course was in Alderaan's Istabith range and led by Chief Pangie of the Chandrilan Pathfinding Corps. During their orientation at the pathfinders' chalet basecamp, Holdo met several of her fellow classmates and soon-to-be apprentice legislators, including Chassellon Stevis of Coruscant, Harp Allor of Chandrila, Sssamm Ashsssen of Fillithar, and Alderaan's delegates Kier Domadi and Princess Leia Organa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the introductory pathfinding class, Chief Pangie left the students deep within the frozen Istabith range, charging them with returning to the chalet by nightfall using only their observational skills to guide them out of the wilderness, or risk being expelled from the class. When her fellow student Harp Allor broke her leg during the return hike, Holdo committed to helping Allor back to the chalet alongside students Ashsssen, Domadi, and Organa; Stevis meanwhile led the rest of the class onward, refusing to slow down for their injured classmate. Holdo's crew progressed slowly back down the range and were in danger of missing their nightfall deadline, but the young Gatalentan's unconventional thinking saved them from failure when she thought to convert her expandable emergency tent into an ad hoc toboggan that could carry all five members of her troop downhill."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Apprentice Legislator"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the days following her first pathfinding class on Alderaan, Holdo moved to Coruscant and took residence in dormitories for members of the Apprentice Legislature. She was present for the legislature's opening ceremonies in the Senate complex, where she witnessed an introductory speech by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin. Her gaudy wardrobe and peculiar behavior at the following reception contributed to Holdo's growing reputation for eccentricity among her fellow delegates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Holdo participated in the first formal session of the Apprentice Legislature the next day, where she introduced to her colleagues her passion for astrology and participated in a debate over where Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine should charter a new Imperial academy for aeronautical engineering and design. The debate was focused on four potential sites: Iloh, Harloff Minor, Lonera, and the impoverished world Arreyel. Princess Organa argued in favor of selecting Arreyel and convinced a winning margin of delegates to support the proposal. Weeks later, Holdo learned that the Apprentice Legislature received a special commendation for their selection of Arreyel after early surveys for the academy revealed massive sub-surface radiation sources. The discovery triggered an Imperial effort to displace the local populace within six weeks so the Imperial Military could blast away the surface and build sprawling planet-wide factories on Arreyel. Holdo was devestated by the development shared her disappointment with Organa and Domadi, both of whom were also opposed to the brutal authoritarianism of Palpatine's reign."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In a later session, the Apprentice Legislature was tasked with determining which punitive sanctions would be levied against the planet Lolet for its violation of Regulation 16-ME, which stipulated that worlds were legally required to provide fuel to Imperial pilots as needed. Holdo was opposed to any sanctions at all, arguing that Lolet's refusal to provide the fuel was reasonable, considering its economic conditions and low reserves of fuel indicated the planet was in a state of near-crisis. Her research revealed that Lolet's reserves were largely depleted after significant geological activity on one of its moons, leaving the world without the resources to support both Imperial patrols and their own people in the event of future emergencies. Holdo's argument\u2014that no planet was legally required to imperil themselves to supply the military\u2014was convincing for Domadi and Organa. She was opposed by delegates from Arkanis and Glee Anselm, who ridiculed her flamboyant style and accused her of treason for the mere suggestion that the Empire was not a reliable safety net for worlds in crisis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The episode had a deep impact on Princess Organa, who fiercely defended Holdo on the legislature's floor and motioned successfully to draft a new language proposal for the Imperial Legal Code rather than impose sanctions on Lolet for circumstances not enshrined in law. The Lolet debate and other experiences endeared Organa to Holdo, and the two became increasingly close during their terms. Holdo instructed the Alderaanian noble in Gatalentan skyfaring and helped Organa to better understand her evolving relationship with her parents and her paramour, Kier Domadi. At the time, Organa weighed whether to involve Holdo in the clandestine operations of the nascent allied rebel movement organized by her father, Senator Bail Organa, but decided against it."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Princess's companion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the legislative term, Holdo continued her pathfinding class with Cheif Pangie and the other delegates, attending sessions in Eriadu's Rivoche Ranges, on Felucia's jungle cliffs, and through Chandrila's vast marshlands.

Organa knew Lenz to be a co-conspirator in her father's rebel network, to whom the senator was also secretly brokering sales of quadanium. While they eavesdropped on Lenz's conversation, the two girls learned that a shipment of Lenz's quadanium was imminently leaving Pamarthe for Ocahont\u2014a world which Organa knew to be a hub for rebel operations. When Organa indicated her desire to know more about the shipment, Holdo jumped aboard the freighter bound for Ocahont, compelling Organa to stow away with her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "En route to Ocahont, Organa revealed to Holdo that she had firsthand knowledge of an armed and organized rebel movement. Before she could reveal more, the two stowaways were discovered by a pair of Quarren crewmembers and taken to a rebel outpost on Ocahont as prisoners. There, they were presented to the outpost overseer: Chandrila's other senator and close ally of the Organas, Mon Mothma. Although Mothma was frustrated at the Princess for putting herself in a dangerous situation and revealing the rebel plot to Holdo, the senator was grateful for the girls' information about Lenz's double dealing. After the meeting with Senator Mothma, Holdo and Organa were sent back to their parents; Holdo maintained Organa's secret and did not reveal to her parents the true nature of her stowaway misadventure."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Holdo returned to Coruscant shortly thereafter to go to a formal ball at the Imperial Palace attended by apprentice legislators and graduates from the Royal Imperial Academy. Some time after the ball, she planned to return to Gatalenta to participate in a meditative retreat, and so hired the light freighter Mighty Oak Apocalypse to ferry her from Coruscant back to her homeworld. At the spaceport, Holdo was met by Chassellon Stevis, who argued that he should be able to usurp the Mighty Oak Apocalypse's services so he could travel to an auction on Arkanis to buy a rare speeder. While the two argued, Princess Organa found them and asked Holdo if she could use the ship's services instead. Holdo recognized the urgency in Organa's request and immediately agreed to help her friend, to Stevis's irritation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Organa had learned that the Empire was aware of a rebel presence in the Paucris system, where Senator Bail Organa was overseeing a secret staging ground for a fledgling rebel fleet as its vessels were refitted for combat. Together aboard the Mighty Oak Apocalypse, Holdo and Organa travelled back to Pamarthe, where they planned to hire a different ship from a high-traffic spaceport to reach Paucris and warn Senator Organa that the Empire was likely to launch an imminent attack. On Pamarthe, the two girls struggled to find a willing pilot due to dangerous atmospheric and solar storms, but Organa managed to use her political connections to convince a crew of Chalhuddans to take the job."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Chalhuddan vessel reached the Paucris system with enough time for Organa's warning to reach her father. As the rebel fleet prepared to evacuate, Holdo and Organa briefly rendezvoused with the senator on his starship, the Tantive IV, before transferring to a small hopper transport that they could fly back to Coruscant. The Princess kept the hopper in-system while Holdo monitored the dozens of rebel ships escaping to hyperspace. After the rebel vessels left, Holdo noticed one new ship moving quickly towards the abandoned refitting stations. To her and Organa's surprise, the vessel's pilot was Kier Domadi, who had followed Organa to the Paucris system. Domadi was unaware that the stations had engaged their self-destruct mechanism and his vessel was caught in the resulting explosion. Holdo and Organa docked their ship with Domadi's badly damaged transport to rescue him, but their friend had been mortally wounded in the explosion and died."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Organa retrieved Domadi's body and grieved the loss of her romantic partner, Holdo flew their hopper directly to Alderaan, knowing that both of her friends needed to return to their home. Upon entering the Alderaan system, their ship was detected by Imperial authorities who suspected it was returning from the Paucris system. Holdo's knowledge of astrology helped her convincingly lie to the Imperial captain that they had instead just come from the Shili system, and was able to return Organa and Domadi safely home."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Holdo and Organa became close friends after the death of Domadi as they leaned on one another to process the loss.

Organa was impressed with Holdo's driving skills in a practice area, but did not agree to go with her friend to find the museum, insisting that nobody could get deeper than Level 5 on Coruscant. Holdo was insistent that it was possible, and plunged the two deep into the Coruscant underbelly to find directions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At an underworld circus, Holdo found a Zeltron fortune teller called Lady Forzaa and pushed Organa to pay for her assistance. In exchange, Forzaa used a Liga crystal to imbue Organa's hands with a soft glow that strengthened as they approached the museum Holdo sought. Back in their speeder, Holdo took the girls deeper into the undercity, following Organa's glow, until they happened upon a group of criminals carrying out operations in the darkness. The girls were chased by the criminals on speeder bikes and managed to flee into a massive pipeline before being driven out by a thermal detonator blast and a swarm of mutant roach-rats. Holdo and Organa escaped all their pursuers and made it to the museum on Level 4, where they discovered a soaring statuary hall lit by glowing blue coral.

Holdo made her way to the bridge, where she discovered the ship's commander, Captain Jardar, was killed in the initial volley. Minister Holdo quickly began issuing orders to the stunned crew, taking command of the Candor as the highest ranking Rebel on the ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Holdo overcame the bridge crew's reservations about her command when the ship was caught in the Star Destroyer's tractor beam. On her orders, the pilots reoriented the Candor towards the Star Destroyer and opened fire on its exposed hangar.

After the Rebellion was routed and scattered during the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY, Holdo discovered that the once-defunct syndicate Crimson Dawn had returned, and was hosting an auction of Rebel captain Han Solo on the Mid Rim world of Jekara. Solo was a companion of Leia Organa's who had been frozen in carbonite while in Imperial custody shortly after the two escaped from Hoth. Although Holdo was not in regular communication with Organa during this period, she knew the princess was searching for Solo and so left a holomessage at one of their dead drops with the news about the rebel captain, the return of Crimson Dawn, and the invitation to the auction that had gone out to the major actors in the criminal underworld.

Working alongside Lieutenant Lintra and bomber commander Fossil, Holdo led the Resistance to victory over the Sheh Soahi pirates, all while avoiding direct engagement with patrolling First Order forces.

Dameron believed Holdo was planning to abandon ship and put the entire Resistance aboard unarmed and unshielded transports with no hyperdrive ability and no destination, and accused the vice admiral of cowardice and treason. Holdo had fleet security remove Dameron from the bridge, prompting him to move forward with his plans with Finn, Tico, and Lieutenant Connix."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Holdo went to the hangar to personally oversee the evacuation preparation, Dameron and Connix gathered a group of Resistance pilots to stage a mutiny. Dameron and his crew confronted Holdo in the hangar, explaining to her that he had initiated a plan to have Finn and Tico infiltrate the Supremacy to shut down the dreadnought's hyperspace tracker. Holdo rejected Dameron's request to delay the evacuation so that his plan could advance, instead ordering the shuttles to begin the boarding process. With her refusal, Dameron and his compatriots\u2014Connix, C'ai Threnalli, and Nodin Chavdri\u2014drew their blasters and announced they were relieving the vice admiral of her command.

The mutiny was short lived, however. As Dameron shut down power to the hangar, the vice admiral kicked a fuel line loose, blasting Threnalli with vapor. Holdo stunned the Abednedo pilot with her concealed blaster; her compatriots followed her lead, resulting in a shootout in the hangar between her loyal officers and the mutineering pilots. As the Raddus descended into chaos, General Leia Organa awoke from her coma and personally retook the bridge from Dameron, stunning him and capturing his co-conspirators. In the hangar, Holdo and her forces continued battle with Dameron's supporters as news of Organa's return began to spread. The Resistance fighters were uncertain whose side she would take in the conflict until the general herself arrived in the hangar to stop the fighting. She was accompanied by a cadre of soldiers carrying an unconscious Dameron, and she greeted Holdo with a hug, making clear that the vice admiral retained Organa's confidence and loyalty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the mutiny put down, Holdo and Organa resumed their plan to secretly evacuate the Raddus and make for Crait. Holdo took a moment to check on the unconscious Dameron before he was loaded aboard a transport, confiding in Organa that she liked the pilot. As the final transports were loaded, Organa ordered Holdo to board, but the vice admiral refused. She explained that for the transports to escape, someone had to remain aboard the Raddus to lure the First Order fleet away from Crait. Although Organa tried to protest, Holdo reminded the general that she still held technical command of the fleet and therefore outranked her friend, and that \"an admiral goes down with her ship.\" Organa was reluctant to leave her friend aboard the doomed cruiser, but ultimately deferred to Holdo's will. The vice admiral consoled her friend with a final goodbye before the general and the rest of the Resistance departed the Raddus, leaving her behind."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Holdo maneuver"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alone aboard the Raddus, Vice Admiral Holdo returned to the battle bridge. She had complete control over the massive vessel from her station, with a singular goal to buy the Resistance survivors time to reach Crait and flee. As she watched the U-55 transports slip towards the planet, she reflected on her role, her relationship with Leia Organa, and her Gatalentan faith. Although she expected the First Order armada to pursue the Raddus until the Mon Calamari cruiser's fuel depleted, the Supremacy unexpectedly switched targets and opened fire on the unshielded transports bound for Crait. Unknown to the Resistance, Holdo's plan had been leaked to the First Order by way of Dameron's allies, Finn and Rose Tico. Dameron's messages to his compatriots about the situation on the Raddus were overheard by DJ, a thief and slicer who was recruited by Finn and Tico in their effort to infiltrate the Supremacy.

Holdo watched in horror from her station on the bridge as the Supremacy picked off the vessels with ease. One of the transport pilots contacted Holdo, frantically asking if the convoy should return to the Raddus. Knowing that the transports were too far out from the shield envelope to hope for any protection from their flagship, Holdo ordered them to continue full speed towards Crait planetfall.

Dameron had entered hyperspace jump coordinates when he stormed the bridge; since the Raddus and its pursuers had continued along their trajectory towards Crait after the mutiny, the entry point for the jump was now located behind the First Order fleet. Although the likelihood of this outcome was infinitesimally small, Holdo hoped she could initiate the hyperspace jump and ram the enemy forces. Understanding it to be her only option, she brought the cruiser about and pointed it directly at the Supremacy. Both Resistance forces on the transports and First Order officers aboard the armada thought that Holdo was preparing to jump in order to flee the battle; the commanders of the Supremacy realized too late that the cruiser was aimed at the heart of their fleet and posed a significant risk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Holdo overrode the fail-safes aboard the Raddus and made the jump. The massive vessel accelerated to nearly the speed of light and impacted the Supremacy as a lethal projectile bound for hyperspace.

The plasma remnants of Holdo's cruiser continued forward at lightspeed, cracking open the hulls of twenty Resurgent-class Star Destroyers assembled behind the Supremacy before being launched into hyperspace.
