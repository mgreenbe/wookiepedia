They were armed with a large point defense laser cannon capable of taking out enemy starfighters, as well as a twin blaster cannon for anti-personnel use. The V-232 was used against the First Order during their attack on Crait, firing up at attacking First Order starfighters in an effort to repel the enemy forces.
