Born in 1947, he was raised as a military brat; television re-runs of classic movies watched in his youth fostered his love of storytelling. His early adulthood found him playing bass in rock bands throughout New York and New Jersey, and being on the road with The Manhattan Transfer fueled his love of traveling. Much of the 1970s saw Luceno embark on various globetrotting adventures, and a detailed journal he kept of his experiences eventually blossomed into his first novel. He also met Brian Daley, a fellow traveler and aspiring writer, during this decade, and the two became close friends and collaborators, writing together for the 1986 cartoon The Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers and later jointly penning the popular Robotech novels under the pseudonym Jack McKinney. They were also approached by Del Rey Books about relaunching its Star Wars fiction line, but the publisher ultimately lost its licensing rights, and in 1996 Daley passed away from pancreatic cancer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A number of adventure and science fiction novels by Luceno were released in the 1980s and 1990s, and when Del Rey regained the right to publish Star Wars fiction, they hired him to help oversee a massive multi-author series called The New Jedi Order. While overseeing its planning and development, Luceno also contributed three books to the project, and he additionally wrote Cloak of Deception, a 2001 lead-in novel to Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. The rest of the decade added several more Star Wars novels and reference guides to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and his acclaimed Darth Plagueis was released in 2012 following a tumultuous development period that originally saw it shelved in 2007. Luceno successfully pushed for its revival, and the five years between its pitch and publication gave him unprecedented time to work on and perfect it. When the Expanded Universe was re-branded as Star Wars Legends in 2014, he was one of several novelists hired to contribute to the new canon, and his most recent book, Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel, was published in 2016."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Adventures with Brian Daley"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Trekking the Earth"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1974 or 1975, while residing in Englewood, New Jersey, James Luceno met Brian Daley, a young man who had just returned to the United States after serving in the Vietnam War. Daley was attending Jersey City State College in Jersey City, and he was dating a woman who worked at the same restaurant as Luceno's wife. The two men were also both working on their first novels, and when the women realized that their partners were both writers, Luceno and Daley were introduced and became close friends."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1977, Luceno and Daley attended the premiere of a film called Star Wars, which had had little buildup in the media\u2014neither man knew what to expect. According to Luceno, both of them \"had their minds blown\" within the film's first five minutes, and they left the premiere thrilled at having seen a rousing science fiction adventure. Daley felt that science fiction would never be the same, and Luceno would later state that his friend's entire life changed the minute he saw the film. The film had a great impact on both of them and became a leitmotif of sorts in their friendship and collaborations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not long afterward, Daley was contracted to write The Han Solo Adventures, three novels based on the early life of the Star Wars character Han Solo. While plotting the stories, he tossed ideas back and forth with Luceno, who acted as his sounding board. In 1979, Daley was also hired to write the script for a radio drama of Star Wars, and Luceno played the role of sounding board once more, helping Daley refine ideas as they were scripted. When Daley received insider information about a plot point from 1980's The Empire Strikes Back regarding Luke Skywalker's parentage, he spilled the beans to Luceno before they had a chance to see the movie."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luceno and Daley traveled together extensively, journeying to such places as Nepal, Thailand, Peru, Tibet, and the jungles of Central and South America. In 1983, they spent five weeks hiking in the Himalayas, and upon their return to Kathmandu, Nepal, Daley received a telegram informing him that he had been hired to write a radio drama of the latest Star Wars film, Return of the Jedi. It had only been in theaters for a short time, and the two found a grainy bootleg copy of the movie at a Nepalese market and screened it for the Sherpas and porters that they had hired for their trek."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The epic continues"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Ballantine Books' Del Rey imprint was set to relaunch the Star Wars universe in novel form, they planned on employing both Daley and Luceno to author the new adventures. Risa Kessler and the others at Ballantine contacted them, and the two discussed the franchise with each other considerably. Daley conceived of a series about the search for and training of a new generation of Jedi by Luke Skywalker, and the efforts of a clandestine group of Emperor Palpatine's disciples to thwart him. Meanwhile, Luceno began to write a book called The Tao of the Force, a reference work that included excerpts and lessons from old Jedi texts. Although he spent months on it, it ended up being nixed by Star Wars creator George Lucas, who didn't want the Force to be treated as a religion. Ultimately, an internal political battle at Ballantine saw them lose the license to publish Star Wars literature, and new publisher Bantam Spectra instead contacted author Timothy Zahn in 1989 to write Heir to the Empire, which kicked off a coordinated and cohesive Star Wars Expanded Universe. Luceno later reflected that Daley would have likely given the saga a mythological tone as opposed to Zahn's military science fiction, and that Daley would have preferred a serialized approach from novel to novel, rather than Bantam's method of jumping around the timeline and filling in bits and pieces of the story. Regardless of that, Luceno enjoyed Zahn's early Star Wars Bantam titles as well as those of Kevin J. Anderson and Kathy Tyers."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Loss of a friend"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Daley passed away on February 11, 1996 after months of treatment for his sickness. Luceno was deeply affected by his friend's death, feeling like a parent who had survived a child. Fans also keenly felt the loss, as when Luceno and Lucia St. Clair Robson posted a notice of death online, messages of consolation immediately began to pour in from across the world.

They felt that Bantam's model of releasing standalone trilogies and one-shots in non-chronological order had been confusing to readers and detrimental to character development, and they began working with Lucasfilm Ltd. to plan a series called The New Jedi Order, which would feature new threats to the galaxy and a new generation of heroes. Luceno was contacted by editors at Del Rey and asked to join the project as a consultant, as they were familiar with his work in Robotech\u2014specifically, his work maintaining the continuity demands of an extended story whose fan base was very passionate, and his work wrapping up a long story with The End of the Circle. In March 1998, Luceno attended the initial story conference at Skywalker Ranch, the San Francisco headquarters of Lucasfilm. Luceno then attended a follow-up conference in May to fine-tune the ideas discussed at the first conference. With a rudimentary outline for the project already written by Del Rey Editor at Large Shelly Shapiro, Luceno worked closely with her and Del Rey editor Kathleen O'Shea to fashion a five-year story arc along with story arcs for each of the principal characters. In 1999, Luceno attended several planning sessions for the series at Skywalker Ranch."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Other participants in the early planning of The New Jedi Order were Lucas Licensing Executive Editor Sue Rostoni, Lucasfilm Director of Publishing Lucy Autrey Wilson, Dark Horse Comics Vice President of Publishing Randy Stradley, and several editors and authors from both Del Rey and Dark Horse. A basic storyline was developed, as were the series' primary villains: an extra-galactic species of bloodthirsty religious zealots known as the Yuuzhan Vong. Shapiro believed that Bantam's novels had developed a feeling of stagnation due to nothing significant ever happening to the primary characters, and she felt that Star Wars had lost the edge of realism and tension that had been present in the original trilogy. Her goal was to shake things up and show that the heroes would not be able to count on surviving everything, and the idea of the Yuuzhan Vong killing a major character in the opening volume of the series was floated. When George Lucas vetoed the idea of killing Luke Skywalker, Stradley suggested the death of the Wookiee Chewbacca. Lucas also nixed the idea of the Yuuzhan Vong being Force-users, but he approved the majority of the series' outline, which was drafted and refined by Luceno. Also written by Luceno was a \"series bible,\" and he worked with author Daniel Wallace to expand the map of the Star Wars galaxy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luceno devoured as many existing Star Wars novels, comics, and sourcebooks as he could after being asked by Shapiro if he was interested to work on the series, although he had previously read many of the Bantam-issued novels as they were published and the intention of The New Jedi Order wasn't to incorporate too many elements from the Bantam books to not alienate a new generation of readers, yet fans implored through emails sent to Del Rey to not ignore the continuity established by Bantam. Luceno particularly relied on Stephen J. Sansweet's Star Wars Encyclopedia, the guidebooks by Wallace, Bill Smith and Bill Slavicsek and a slew of fan glossaries and compendiums to keep track of the continuity. In his consultant role, he read and commented on every manuscript submitted by The New Jedi Order's many authors, but he was initially unsure whether he would be contributing any books himself. He was eventually contracted to write the fifth novel in the series, a planned paperback called Agents of Chaos. R. A. Salvatore wrote 1999's Vector Prime, the series opener, and found himself tasked with writing Chewbacca's death; when negative fan reaction to the character's demise manifested in scores of hate mail, Luceno commiserated with Salvatore by sharing stories of his similar experience with Robotech fandom, feeling that the death threats Salvtore received should have been hurled at Del Rey or to the whole creative team. Michael A. Stackpole was set to write the next three novels, a trilogy called Dark Tide, but when a change in plans compressed Dark Tide into a duology, Agents of Chaos was expanded into two paperbacks."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Writing a tribute"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The New Jedi Order was designed to be a combination of hardcover and paperback novels, with major events happening only in the hardcovers and the paperbacks filling in side adventures. Stackpole's manuscript for Dark Tide I: Onslaught made it apparent that the series' paperbacks would also contain major plot points, however, and Luceno was tasked in his two paperbacks with writing about Han Solo\u2014specifically, Solo's quest to find himself while overcoming the grief he felt at the death of his friend Chewbacca. Shapiro believed that many of Bantam's authors had not known what to do with Solo in their novels, which had resulted in character stagnation, and Luceno was eager for the chance to develop the character throughout something more than a simple rousing adventure. He hoped to take Solo through a heroic journey reminiscent of the original Star Wars trilogy, and he saw the Agents of Chaos Duology's first volume as a \"Han Solo, this is your life\" novel. It had a working title of Solo Crusade, which was eventually changed to Hero's Trial."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having been with The New Jedi Order since its inception, Luceno did not find it difficult to drop into a writing role, but he did spend a good deal of time learning the rules and regulations of the Star Wars franchise. Challenged to write about an older and grief-stricken Han Solo, his aim was to approach Solo's grief in a very adult way and to push the character away from his wife Leia Organa Solo. Solo withdrawing into himself after Chewbacca's death generated a negative reception, which surprised Luceno, as the series was conceived to be darker though it was possibly \"too realistic\" in the team's thinking. Luceno has identified Solo as one of his favorite characters to write, calling him the most human of the Star Wars saga's principal characters given his inability to evolve like his Force-sensitive family, and in focusing on him Luceno was pleased at the chance to write an homage to Brian Daley. A number of characters from Daley's Han Solo Adventures re-appear in Hero's Trial, and Luceno often felt his late friend's presence on his shoulder while he wrote the book. He found a sweet-and-sour irony in the experience, as he saw his friendship with Daley as akin to the one between Solo and Chewbacca."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Daley's works were not the only source material from which Luceno drew inspiration while writing the Agents of Chaos Duology, as both novels feature returning characters from Bantam's various scattered Star Wars books. Boba Fett was even originally going to appear in Hero's Trial, but he was written out due to concerns that the book was adding too many characters and replaced by Big Bunji. While further developing the story, Luceno also chose to not kill Roa during the attack on the Jubilee Wheel as originally planned. Many elements of the duology were Luceno's own creation, including the Ryn species, who were modeled after the real-world Romany people, and the Fosh Jedi Vergere, who was designed as an unorthodox character from the start and was first mentioned in Greg Bear's 2000 novel Rogue Planet at the planning team's request. The books see Solo get a new partner in the form of the Ryn Droma, whom Luceno hoped would complement Solo and help guide him through his grief. Hero's Trial was released on August 1, 2000, and its sequel Jedi Eclipse came out two months later. Jedi Eclipse's working title had been The Crooked Sky. Both volumes sold very well, as every installment of the New Jedi Order performed strongly on the market, exceeding the expectations of the planning team."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Delving into darkness"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luceno had intended for Droma to stay on as Solo's partner after the events of Agents of Chaos, but when letters poured in from fans indicating that they wanted to see Solo team up with his wife, Leia, Droma began to fade into the background. Luceno's consultant role continued; he at some point sat down with Shapiro, Rostoni, and authors Troy Denning and Matthew Stover at Skywalker Ranch to discuss the the future of the series. When the planning team decided to kill another major character\u2014the Solos' son Anakin\u2014some of The New Jedi Order's subplots were jettisoned in an effort to spotlight Anakin prior to his demise, including one that Luceno had begun in Agents of Chaos regarding the rights and awareness of droids. The request to kill off Anakin also forced the team to rethink the plot very quickly, as by that point Vector Prime had already being outlined. Luceno and the other writers agreed to kill Anakin upon concluding that they wanted a tragedy to accompany the Fall of Coruscant. The largest casualty of the series' focus shift was Michael Jan Friedman's Knightfall Trilogy, which was canceled completely. Greg Keyes's 2001 Edge of Victory Duology replaced Knightfall and focused heavily on Anakin, and fewer New Jedi Order books released that year allowed Del Rey and Lucasfilm to publish several novels set in the era of the ongoing Star Wars prequel trilogy. Luceno was hired to write a lead-up novel to Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace titled Cloak of Deception, as well as an eBook novella called Darth Maul: Saboteur. The working title of the former was Vergence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While writing Saboteur, Luceno found it difficult to get inside the head of Darth Maul, a character with a mysterious background, and to write scenes from Maul's perspective. He tried to imagine what it would be like to serve Darth Sidious, Maul's Sith Master, and chose to portray Maul introspectively after drawing inspiration from the relationship between Darth Vader and the Emperor in Return of the Jedi. In February 2001, Saboteur was released exclusively in electronic format on the websites of online booksellers such as Amazon and Barnes & Noble for $1.99. It was later included in the paperback reprint of Michael Reaves's 2000 novel Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Luceno first saw The Phantom Menace, he was intrigued by the opening crawl and its references to events that occurred before the film, and with Cloak of Deception he ultimately got to write that backstory. George Lucas himself instructed Luceno to write a political thriller that focused on the Galactic Republic's Senator Palpatine and Chancellor Valorum, but he forbade Luceno from revealing that Palpatine and Darth Sidious were the same person, as he considered it to be a spoiler. He did, however, allow Luceno to depict Palpatine as a master politician and consummate manipulator, and Luceno ended up enjoying portraying the two as separate characters. To get inside Palpatine's head, he closely studied all of the character's scenes in The Phantom Menace, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi, hoping that he could mimic Palpatine's gestures and speech patterns. He also looked to several of William Shakespeare's works in depicting Palpatine's manipulative relationship with Valorum, whom he saw as a tragic figure like Iago, Cassius or Richard III. Luceno likened the writing process to being entrusted to write about the state of the Garden of Eden before the meeting between Eve and the serpent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While writing Cloak of Deception, Luceno drew inspiration from famous authors of political thrillers such as Frederick Forsyth and Robert Ludlum, but his first few outlines were heavy on action and focused largely on the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and other secondary characters. Shapiro and Rostoni helped him trim down the action until he had struck a balance between politics and lightsabers. After his first draft was completed, he was given the script of the upcoming film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, which provided him insight into the inner workings of the Galactic Senate and allowed him to introduce organizations that would go on to appear in the film. At Lucas's request, he included a character from the film in his novel. Luceno also took the opportunity to expand on an in-joke included by Lucas in The Phantom Menace: the Asogians, a species which referenced the titular character of Steven Spielberg's classic film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. As an allusion, Luceno named Grebleips\u2014\"Spielberg\" spelled backwards\u2014to the species' Senator and gave him the homeworld of Brodo Asogi, a name given to E.T.'s planet in William Kotzwinkle's spin-off novel E.T.: The Book of the Green Planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the time of its publishing, Cloak was the earliest adult novel in the Star Wars timeline, and Luceno accordingly chose to treat it as an introduction to the entire saga, giving short descriptions of elements of the Star Wars universe that some readers already took for granted, such as Jedi Knights, the Force, and the dark side. He compared it to J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit serving as an introduction to The Lord of the Rings, and it was a unique challenge that he enjoyed, as was the challenge of constructing an entire backstory for Valorum based on a single line from The Phantom Menace. He felt like the entire novel hinged on that one line, and he found the process of thinking backwards to be a great exercise. In comparison to writing during the New Republic era in The New Jedi Order, Luceno felt that the formality of speech, costume and manner of Coruscant during the Republic era did little to mask the Galactic Republic's corruption, as everyone was too jaded to bother for the hypocrisy, comparing the Galactic Republic to Rome before the Roman Empire's fall and the New Republic to America during the American Revolutionary War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luceno attempted to mirror the three-part structure of the Star Wars films and to honor as many of the saga's conventions as he could; once he had the full story figured out, he treated Cloak of Deception as the novelization of a Star Wars film that was running in his head. One other source of inspiration from which he drew was the Ethiopian city of Lalibela, which made its way into the book. Cloak of Deception was released in hardcover on May 29, 2001."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Concluding an era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luceno and Shapiro conferred throughout the production of The New Jedi Order, and when it reached the halfway point, they reassessed what had already been done, and discussed what still needed doing and how the series would wrap up. As Luceno had been with the series from the beginning and had been privy to nearly every idea that had been proposed, he emerged as a natural choice to write the final volume; he was familiar with the characters and story arcs and had a vast amount of information at his fingertips. Many of the series' secondary plot lines were yet to be resolved, and Luceno assembled a three-page list of dangling threads that needed to be closed. In all, the book took him nearly a year to research and write, and he found a good deal of satisfaction in being chosen to conclude the series. Someone he was finally able to write into The New Jedi Order was Boba Fett, who had earlier been cut from Hero's Trial."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luceno devised the book's title\u2014The Unifying Force\u2014from the concept of the Unifying Force, a future-oriented view of the Force concerned with the consequences of actions. The Jedi struggling to find their way through the war had been a major theme of the entire series, and Luceno saw The Unifying Force as being largely about the Force and its redefinition by Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order. The title also extended to the Galactic Alliance amassing a unified force of fleets against the Yuuzhan Vong, and to the Yuuzhan Vong Shamed Ones, outcasts who would play a major role in ending the war. The author's favorite characters to write in the novel were those who were forced to rethink truths that they had long accepted, including Jacen Solo, Luke Skywalker, the droid C-3PO, and the Yuuzhan Vong characters Nom Anor and Harrar. With Harrar, Luceno hoped to give the Yuuzhan Vong more depth than traditional black-and-white villainy, as he had always seen them as tragic wanderers rather than hateful invaders. He drew inspiration from the Indigenous peoples of the Americas like the Maya and the Aztec, cultures with inherent tragedy, and he hoped to give the book a good deal of gray morality. Del Rey editor Steve Saffel had earlier wondered aloud during the series' initial brainstorming sessions if such cultures might serve as models for the Yuuzhan Vong."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the planning team discussed the idea of wiping out the Yuuzhan Vong at the series' end, they felt that a merciful option would be more interesting and had the invaders sent into exile. The idea of the primary villain being a puppet was Luceno's and came about in The New Jedi Order's earliest story conferences; he also considered killing Han Solo in The Unifying Force, but he ultimately decided against it. In writing the book's final scenes, he drew inspiration from the ending of the The Lord of the Rings, which felt like an age was coming to a close. He tried to leave the characters in places where fans could imagine them moving on and living their lives, and he later admitted that with the book he was attempting to wrap up the entire Star Wars saga. The saga continued with more books, however, to the point where Luceno believed there were no places left for the characters to go."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The New Jedi Order had not been an easy project, owing to the sheer number of contributing authors pulling the storyline in several different directions, as well as deadlines that conflicted with the authors' non-Star Wars novels, illnesses, canceled books, eleventh-hour changes to the story arc, and the fan reaction to Chewbacca's death. Regardless, Luceno felt that it was an interesting series and a good experiment for Star Wars fiction, and he has stated that The New Jedi Order became more fun and exciting when its plot was completely transformed midway through, thus allowing its authors to do more than just fill in the material between major plot points. He expressed relief when it was finally over, and he joked that he was a Star Wars EMT, with fellow author Aaron Allston calling The Unifying Force \"a giant NJO band-aid.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Unifying Force was released in hardcover on November 4, 2003, and Luceno toured the United States throughout November to promote it. Included in its release was a CD-ROM that included an e-book of Vector Prime and a round-robin interview with Luceno and other members of The New Jedi Order's development team. His next project was a more personal one, as he decided to follow a life-long dream of acquiring land somewhere in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Having learned to thatch in Guatemala, he hoped to build a thatched-roof house on the property. He intended to take a long break from Star Wars, but after being shown art of the Battle of Hoth and of Ben Kenobi's hut, he agreed to write the reference book Inside the Worlds of Star Wars Trilogy. Published by Dorling Kindersley, it was illustrated by Hans Jenssen and Richard Chasemore, with renowned Star Wars scholar Curtis Saxton acting as a consultant\u2014Saxton had previously written the fan project Star Wars Technical Commentaries.

He himself was commissioned to write a lead-in to Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith set during the Clone Wars that starred Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the novel, Labyrinth of Evil, was billed as a \"must-read prequel\" to the film. Although he enjoyed the fact that Star Wars films generally opened in the middle of an action sequence and left the back story for audiences to fill in themselves, he still jumped at the chance to write the background for Revenge of the Sith's opening battle. Luceno was given the first draft of the movie's script and was continually updated on its revisions, and in January 2004 he spent two days at Skywalker Ranch discussing the script with Shapiro, Rostoni, Howard Roffman, and Matthew Stover, who was writing the film's novelization."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of Luceno's important tasks with the book was to provide a backstory for General Grievous, and he was also able to address certain plot points from Attack of the Clones that remained unresolved, such as the mystery behind the erasure of Kamino from the Jedi Archives, which Lucas opted to not reveal in Revenge of the Sith after refocusing the story on Anakin Skywalker. He prepared a list of questions that Stover asked for him while meeting with George Lucas, and Lucas gave input on the back stories of both Grievous and Sifo-Dyas, as well as on Grievous's attack on Coruscant. Believing that the fighting would mostly take place on the ground, Luceno intended for Chancellor Palpatine to be whisked about like George W. Bush in Air Force One during the September 11 attacks, but Lucas revealed that it would mostly be a space battle and suggested that he think in terms of the Secret Service sequestering Dick Cheney in a hardened bunker on that day. Lucas also provided information on Count Dooku's allegiance to Darth Sidious and on the prophecy of the Chosen One, and his answers gave Luceno a good foundation and made him feel confident that there was indeed a book to be written from the story. The author went to Mexico to think through his book's plot, and when he saw a fellow traveler reading Tom Clancy's The Hunt for Red October and got the idea to write about a hunt for Darth Sidious, Labyrinth of Evil's story began to take shape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stover and Luceno stayed in touch, with Luceno reading Stover's novelization as it was being written and Stover reading Labyrinth of Evil's outline and working references to it into his own manuscript.

Scenes were also cut from the film as its script evolved, including an exchange between Obi-Wan Kenobi and a Clone Commander that had inspired Labyrinth of Evil's opening scene; General Grievous also emerged as a different character in later versions of the script. One scene from the script that did make the final cut included a reference to the planet Cato Neimoidia, which Luceno used as a jumping off point for his story\u2014he hoped to make Labyrinth of Evil more directly tied to Revenge of the Sith than previous prequels had been. He spoke frequently with Rostoni, Episode III Set Diarist Pablo Hidalgo, and The Making of Star Wars Revenge of the Sith author Jonathan Rinzler, all of whom were attending dailies or viewing rough cuts of the movie. He was also writing the reference book Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith: The Visual Dictionary for Doring Kindersley, which gave him access to film stills, props, other photographic material, and insider information, while he worked in partnership with both Lucasfilm and Industrial Light & Magic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A highlight of writing Labyrinth of Evil for Luceno was portraying Skywalker and Kenobi as friends instead of their usual master and apprentice role. He gave them a smooth-functioning and light-hearted repartee partly as a counterpoint to the grimness and heaviness of The New Jedi Order, and partly because Labyrinth was the saga's last chance for lightness and humor before the very dark Revenge of the Sith. With Skywalker set to turn to the dark side in the movie, Luceno wrote him as no longer fearing drawing on dark power and in fact becoming infatuated with it, building on character development that had occurred throughout the Clone Wars multimedia project. After his outline received approval from Lucasfilm, he was dismayed to learn about two other projects that were in development: the third season of the Star Wars: Clone Wars cartoon and a comic series from Dark Horse tentatively titled Star Wars: Countdown, both of which were telling the same lead-in story as Labyrinth of Evil but in different ways. Attempts were made to divvy up characters and plotlines, but the animated series was not set to be storyboarded until well after Labyrinth of Evil's manuscript was due. Luceno later stated in an interview with Star Wars Insider that fans may find \"slightly different accounting of the same events.\" The Star Wars: Clone Wars team in fact built their story around Luceno's book, but they departed from its details in order for it to better befit the the climax of an animated series. Brief and fleeting mentions of characters and a planet from the series were inserted into Labyrinth of Evil at the last minute.

In the book, Shryne was one of several Jedi who initially felt disillusioned with the Force in the aftermath of the purge. Luceno found inspiration for writing Vader after speaking with a LucasArts employee who had worn Vader's suit for a photo session and had described what it felt like to be inside of the costume.

He granted himself a sabbatical from writing following its release, but he was hired to consult with authors Aaron Allston, Troy Denning, and Karen Traviss on a nine-book series they were writing that was set after The New Jedi Order. A scene from Dark Lord was re-created in the fifth issue of the comic series Star Wars: Dark Times, which was written by Mick Harrison (in fact a pseudonym of Randy Stradley's) and released in 2007. The issue featured Vader and was set during the same time period; Luceno was credited in the comic for writing the scene's dialogue. He was also approached by Tommy Yune, director of the Robotech film The Shadow Chronicles, about writing a novelization of the movie, but he did not feel right contradicting what he and Brian Daley had already written and declined the offer. The content of Luceno's Inside the Worlds of Star Wars Trilogy was reprinted in the October 2005 compendium Star Wars: Complete Locations, and Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith The Visual Dictionary was similarly reprinted one year later inside Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Poised to pen Plagueis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a multi-week trek in the Guatemalan jungle, Luceno went to an internet cafe and discovered an e-mail from Lucasfilm that asked if he was interested in writing a novel about Darth Plagueis, a character who was mentioned in Revenge of the Sith and who was name-dropped by Luceno in Labyrinth of Evil. He has stated that he \"nearly keeled over\" when he read the e-mail, as he had hoped for the chance to write about Plagueis but had figured that the character would be be off-limits. He was thrilled at the opportunity, and his involvement with the project was first announced on StarWars.com in June 2006 in an article that projected a 2008 release for the book. Luceno was invited to Skywalker Ranch to discuss the novel, and his time there coincided with story conferences for the nine-book series Star Wars: Legacy of the Force on which he had been hired to consult. He attended the conferences, where a story was laid out that would see Jacen Solo fall to the dark side of the Force, a character direction that Luceno had not envisioned while writing The Unifying Force. He had felt that Jacen was the natural successor to lead Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order, and in a 2007 interview, he remarked on the character's fall by saying \"I didn't see that coming, to tell you the truth.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luceno had a number of discussions with Lucasfilm representatives about how the novel should be approached before he wrote and submitted a detailed outline, working mostly with Howard Roffman in discussing what he could and could not do. George Lucas was also involved with early stages of the project's planning, and Luceno wrote to him to ask if Plagueis could be non-Human. Lucas decided that he could be a Muun and sent Luceno some artist renderings and production sketches of Muun characters; he also gave Luceno other tidbits about Plagueis' character and decided that Plagueis should wear a transpirator mask after having an accident at some point in his life. Luceno initially pitched the novel as a first-person narrative, telling Plagueis' life story via a holocron discovered by his apprentice, Palpatine, immediately after Plagueis' death. Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles novels were a key source of inspiration for that format. Another early idea for the story saw it structured as a race for immortality between Plagueis and Qui-Gon Jinn, unaware that they were pursuing the same goal and inadvertently sabotaging each other's efforts. The story ended with Jinn contacting the Whills, mysterious beings first mentioned in an epigraph in the original Star Wars novelization."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luceno made a significant start on writing the book after thinking and planning for months in advance, but feedback soon arrived stating that Lucasfilm wanted the book to more prominently feature Palpatine. They felt that Plagueis' story was less interesting than Palpatine's, and Luceno was happy with the directive, as he had believed that there would be restrictions against focusing too heavily on Palpatine. However, one staff member at Lucasfilm was very opposed to some of the areas that Luceno wanted to explore with the novel, and in a 2008 interview, Luceno posited that he had been over-reaching by making Palpatine's background and history too concrete, thus diminishing the mystery behind his character and undermining his effect as a representation of evil incarnate that George Lucas and Ian McDiarmid always viewed on Palpatine. He also later called his original Qui-Gon Jinn-centric outline \"all over the place, way too long, and trying too hard to resolve every loose end.\" The project was put on hold in 2007, as decisions about the nature of the Sith and their Rule of Two still had to be made. Staff at Lucasfilm also wanted to take a step back and wait to see what Lucas would do with projects such as the Star Wars: The Clone Wars cartoon. The novel was replaced by Drew Karpyshyn's Darth Bane: Rule of Two and given a new release date of December 26, 2007. Luceno held onto hope that the novel would one day be unshelved, and Sue Rostoni reassured fans that he was an author Lucasfilm was not willing to lose. Leland Chee, the Keeper of the Star Wars Holocron continuity database, revealed that Plagueis remained canonically a Muun despite the cancellation, and in 2009 Wizards of the Coast released a miniature figurine of Plagueis as a Muun wearing a transpirator mask."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Chronicling a legend"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2007, Luceno was approached to write a book about the Millennium Falcon, a starship that had become nothing short of a cultural icon. Del Rey had recently renegotiated their contract to publish Star Wars fiction, and during a story conference on novels to be written under the new contract, Pablo Hidalgo and Leland Chee had each independently taken inspiration from the Death Star novel and suggested a book about the Falcon. Shelly Shapiro gave Luceno considerable freedom with the book, telling him that it could be an anthology of short stories if he wanted, as long as it were set in the aftermath of Legacy of the Force and featured Allana Solo, the granddaughter of Han and Leia. The official pitch to him mentioned that it should feature an aging Han Solo being prompted to investigate the Falcon's history, and it described the book as a \"love letter to Falcon fans\" with \"no galaxy-shattering events.\" The anthology idea appealed to him, but he wanted it to function as a novel; he ended up viewing the final product as a kind of hybrid, though, as the story features a large cast of characters telling the ship's history through the voices of its many former owners. The book sees Han Solo investigating his ship's past in the midst of a grand treasure hunt; writing so many characters, settings, and points of view made Luceno feel like he was penning ten different novels. It was unlike anything he had ever done before, but he enjoyed the challenge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The novel was simply given the title Millennium Falcon, which Luceno hoped would draw in casual readers. Although it was set late in the Expanded Universe timeline, he tried to make it function as a standalone novel that was accessible to new readers, and he used the stories of the ship's former owners to introduce and touch on various eras in the Star Wars timeline and summarize events that had occurred since the end of Return of the Jedi. He did not want to write the Falcon as a ship with a droid's level of consciousness, but he did want to give it its own origin myth and to give it a history as varied and textured as Solo's own. He had believed there was an interesting history to the ship right from its first mention in the original Star Wars film, and further hints at its past life in The Empire Strikes Back and its cameo in Revenge of the Sith had only added fuel to the fire. Its presence in the latter movie set the stage in Luceno's mind for a full-fledged story, one in which he wanted the Falcon to have been the property of more than just smugglers and soldiers\u2014to keep things interesting, he gave it more unconventional owners, such as a circus. His goal was to have the ship impact the lives of everyone who had piloted it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While at Skywalker Ranch to discuss the project, Luceno was able to sit in on story conferences for the upcoming nine-book Fate of the Jedi series. Since his novel was going to form a sort of bridge between Legacy of the Force and Fate of the Jedi, he felt that his presence at the meetings was important. As the new series began to take shape, he worked more setup for it into Millennium Falcon, staying in touch with series authors Troy Denning and Aaron Allston to make sure he was doing what they needed him to do. The character of Seff Hellin was created in order to set some important things in motion. The book was initially going to be set in the immediate aftermath of Legacy of the Force, but Luceno argued for pushing it to two years later\u2014although he wanted it to be a much lighter novel than Legacy of the Force had been, he knew he would have to address the death of Jacen Solo, which had happened at the series' end. With those extra two years, he wanted Han and Leia Solo to be able to put the issue to rest and look toward a brighter future. He also worried that the book would be too similar to Hero's Trial if their grief was so fresh, and he additionally believed that a seven-year-old Allana would make a better character than a five-year-old Allana."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At this point in his career, Luceno found it more difficult to write about the Jedi, as different authors always seemed to have different ideas about what the Jedi and the Force were capable of. With Millennium Falcon, he was glad to be writing about more mundane and less ethereal aspects of the Star Wars universe, and he also called the project \"a breath of fresh air\" in that he was writing a small-scale narrative instead of huge galactic events that needed to advance the plot points of an ongoing series. He was happy to be focusing on characterization instead of having \"each line of dialogue read like an oracular pronouncement.\" Despite this, he was worried that standalone novels like Millennium Falcon ran the risk of being seen as filler novels that were irrelevant to the overarching saga. Luceno inserted several easter eggs into the book, including a description of Han Solo that referenced the song That's Life, made famous by Frank Sinatra. The phrase \"The Wook, the Crook, and me,\" uttered by Leia in the book, originally came from Lucia St. Clair Robson and Brian Daley, and Luceno also credits Daley for giving him his first thoughts about the Falcon, as they used to discuss the ship and compare it to their own junky cars while Daley was writing The Han Solo Adventures. An oversight by Del Rey prevented St. Clair Robson and Daley from being acknowledged, however, as the dedication page was missing from its original hardcover release. Its December 2008 publication date was swapped with Matthew Stover's Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor, pushing the release ahead and turning its publication into a rush job. As such, he was never sent the book's galley proofs, and one day he was surprised to find a final copy of the book on his front porch, missing its dedication page and including some edits of which he had not been made aware."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Millennium Falcon hardcover hit bookstores on October 21, 2008, and StarWars.com celebrated its release with a week's worth of content on the famous starship.

The Phantom Menace in 3-D and its visual companion saw release in 2012, but the planned expansion of Luceno's original Revenge of the Sith dictionary progressed no further than the outline stage before the 3-D versions of Episodes II and III were indefinitely postponed. A project of his own which he did not give up, however, was his Darth Plagueis novel. After Millennium Falcon, he asked Howard Roffman if there was a chance of revisiting the project, and he was flown to Skywalker Ranch to meet with Roffman personally. Luceno pushed for the revival because he had thought so much about the character of Plagueis and was not willing to let him go; he also felt it was an honor to write about such an important character and was willing to make compromises in order for the novel to happen. Roffman had advice on where he felt Luceno had gone wrong with his original outline and how the story could be improved: namely, a greater focus on Palpatine. Luceno was initially wary of humanizing Palpatine and of making him sympathetic, as he saw Palpatine as a representation of evil in Star Wars\u2014he compared it to Professor Moriarty being an effective representation of evil for Sherlock Holmes because of a lack of background. He drew inspiration from the Star Wars prequel trilogy, however, which had told the story of Anakin Skywalker's transition into Darth Vader, and he began to realize that he could focus on Palpatine without diminishing his character."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luceno spent months making many revisions and submitting many different versions of the outline before he and Roffman reached an agreement on what the book should do. The novel, simply titled Darth Plagueis, was thus reborn. Some of what he had originally developed was carried over, but most of it was scrapped so that he could cast more of the book's spotlight on Palpatine and his relationship with Plagueis. In working so closely with Roffman, Luceno bypassed both Del Rey and the usual Lucasfilm editorial staff, which was a new experience for him. He described Roffman as \"George's right-hand man at Lucas Licensing\" and assumed that Roffman was speaking directly with Lucas about much of what was going into Darth Plagueis, as it often seemed like the approval was coming to Roffman through Lucas. The plot and story structure were ultimately designed by Luceno, and although some of his ideas were rejected, he later reflected that their axing was for the better. In all, Luceno's discussions with Roffman amounted to about one year of preparation. He had only been given about six months each to write his previous novels, but from Darth Plagueis's initial pitch to its publication, Luceno had five years with which to play. He had not stopped thinking about it after its 2007 cancellation and had done research on The Phantom Menace's pre-history, using both Star Wars novels and Wookieepedia as resources\u2014he believed extensive research was important given how much territory Darth Plagueis was set to cover."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That amount of territory led Luceno to see Darth Plagueis as a sort of untold history of the Star Wars prequel era. With his vast knowledge of the Expanded Universe and the notes on it he had made over the years, he was able to bring in existing characters and situations that were important to the era in order for the story to come together, researching the era in almost the same way he would for a real-life historical book. He was worried that the novel would be a cumbersome read and made an effort not to overdo the references, as he did not want readers to have to work too hard to catch them, but he found this more difficult in the book's third act when the story began to overlap with the timeframe of The Phantom Menace. As well as past continuity, Luceno also minded future developments: he stayed in frequent contact with both Leland Chee and Dave Filoni, the supervising director of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars cartoon, to learn what their plans were for the character and backstory of Darth Maul."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luceno thought about Maul a lot while writing Darth Plagueis, and after the novel's manuscript was submitted, he was asked to pen two short stories about the character. Ideas for the stories were already floating around in his head, and he felt like they could have been excerpts from Darth Plagueis had he not wanted to keep the novel's points of view focused on its main characters. Luceno worked closely with both Filoni and Ryder Windham while developing the stories, as Windham was concurrently writing a book called The Wrath of Darth Maul. Since Filoni and The Clone Wars's team had very specific ideas about Maul's background, he and Luceno went back and forth until they reached an agreement on how Luceno should portray the characters' transition to Sith-hood. Mindful of the fact that the backstory he had once written for General Grievous had been overwritten by The Clone Wars, Luceno knew he had to be worried about where the cartoon would take certain stories."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Plagueis was Luceno's first opportunity to really write about what was going on inside Palpatine's head without the constraints of not being able to reveal his secret identity as Darth Sidious. He and Roffman decided together that he would not show Palpatine's ultimate plan for overthrowing his master at work, but that he would subtly indicate that Palpatine had his own agenda and include faint instances of the character's own manipulations\u2014as he knew that he could not fill the novel with space battles and lightsaber duels, Luceno relied on political intrigue and machinations in order to keep the story interesting. In developing Palpatine as a young man, he toyed with many ideas before settling on the character as a spoiled scion of wealth, which allowed his sense of the character to grow. He later stated that he gave the scenes featuring a young Palpatine more thought than any others in the entire novel, and the scene where Palpatine and Plagueis first meet particularly underwent a number of revisions. Luceno ended up discarding much of the material he wrote about young Palpatine, as he was still conscious of the risk of humanizing the character too much, but he did write a scene where a young Palpatine transitions from being inherently evil to openly evil, though he opted to not detail Palpatine's childhood and leave that part of the story untold, recalling the scene as one of the scariest parts of the book, admitting that writing it was unsettling. On Palpatine's relationship with Plagueis, he credits Roffman for always reminding him that the two Sith should be partners throughout the book, plotting together instead of visibly plotting against one another. It gave him a sensibility about the Sith that was different than the one traditionally seen in the Expanded Universe. An early draft of the novel had Plagueis discover Palpatine's first name but never actually use it, as a means of playing to his apprentice's huge ego, but this was ultimately cut. Luceno also drew inspiration from The Godfather in writing Plagueis as a bit of a mobster. On creating Plagueis's master Darth Tenebrous, Luceno chose the Bith as the character's species due to their reputation for braininess, though Luceno was initially reluctant to choose that species due to associating the Bith with the jizz-playing musical band of Chalmun's Cantina until he realized that many different personality types could be found in a single species. The character of Darth Tenebrous was first mentioned by Leland Chee in a 2006 blog entry written to announce the final Darth names considered for the Darth Who Contest organized by Del Rey and Luceno previously mentioned back in 2008 that he would have chosen that name for the first Sith Lord who ever used the Darth title had he been able to do so. He also invented the character of Darth Gravid to explain why Plagueis had no access to some old Sith teachings and Force techniques, finding Gravid's story more interesting the more he thought about the character."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The talks that Luceno had with Roffman revealed that midi-chlorians would have to play a large role in Darth Plagueis. Although Luceno was not a big fan of the concept of midi-chlorians and felt that they robbed the Force of some of its mystery, he knew that they were a part of the Star Wars saga and that there was no way around using them. Aware that they would be a hot-button issue, Luceno drew inspiration from readings he had done on particle physics and described them as intercessors rather than Force-carrying particles in their own right. It was a slight deviation from how they had been described in The Phantom Menace, but he felt that the explanation made more sense and he enjoyed the challenge of bringing sense to the midi-chlorian concept. It allowed Luceno to investigate the Force in a rational and scientific way and to have Plagueis be a scientist rather than a strict mystic; in portraying the character that way he drew inspiration from the H. G. Wells story The Island of Doctor Moreau. Matthew Stover picked up on that character thread with Darth Tenebrous in the companion short story The Tenebrous Way, having Tenebrous experiment in the vein of a classic science fiction mad scientist despite having no contact with Luceno while writing it. The focus on midi-chlorians also allowed Luceno to depict the creation of Anakin Skywalker, but he was not permitted to reveal whether Skywalker was a successful product of Plagueis's manipulation of the midi-chlorians or if he was created by the Force as a counter to Plagueis's experiments. Luceno was told the answer but could not explicitly spell it out in the book."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Luceno's earliest meetings with Roffman, he opined that there was no suspense regarding Plagueis's death, as Star Wars lore had already established that he was killed in his sleep by Palpatine. In Dark Lord, Luceno had mentioned that Plagueis had transcended the need for sleep, and he hoped to heed his own continuity and to retcon Plagueis's death to make it more exciting and less anticlimactic. He was told in no uncertain terms, however, that Plagueis absolutely had to die in his sleep\u2014there would be no lightsaber duel or other retcon. With that in mind, Luceno asked if the character could still be alive during the events of The Phantom Menace. He wanted to create some surprise, and from his earliest viewing of The Phantom Menace he had felt like there was a more sinister force at play than Sidious and Maul. He got the OK from the top levels of Lucasfilm, and he was thrilled, as he suddenly had so much more to work with and an element of surprise that would keep everybody reading. He thought hard about how exactly Plagueis would be brought down by his apprentice, keeping in mind Palpatine's skills at manipulating others and lulling them into false senses of security. Luceno rewrote Plagueis's death scene multiple times and got input from Shelly Shapiro on how to make it the best it could be, and he ultimately chose to open the book with a preview of the scene, kicking off the reader's speculation on when, rather than how, it was going to happen."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to entertain himself, Luceno wrote little bits of humor into the book, including a \"Sith Bith\" whose name translates to \"Darth Dark\" and some wordplay involving the word \"Muun.\" He ended up laughing at his own prose half the time when trying to keep some of the jokes from being too obvious. Darth Plagueis was released in hardcover on January 10, 2012, and it was later nominated for the 2012 Goodreads Award for Best Science Fiction. The short story Restraint was included in a paperback re-release of Michael Reaves's Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter on December 27, 2011, and the short story End Game was included in a paperback re-release of Terry Brooks's novelization of The Phantom Menace on January 31, 2012.

Another announcement was made on April 25, 2014: The new movies would not be beholden to the Expanded Universe, which would be re-branded as \"Star Wars Legends\" while a new canon would emerge under the oversight of a Lucasfilm Story Group. The new canon would include the six principal Star Wars movies, as well as the Star Wars: The Clone Wars animated series and the then-forthcoming Star Wars Rebels cartoon. Author Mike Fessler, whom Luceno had met sometime before or during the early 2010s, reached out Luceno to ask him for help to get the necessary publishing deal and licensing agreement to publish a visual reference guide to clone troopers. Loving Fessler's idea and manuscript, Luceno offered to make a few calls on Fessler's behalf, aiding him to work with Lucasfilm, Del Rey and DK Publishing to make the project. By mid-2012, the book was mostly done until the Lucasfilm sale to Disney happened in October, after which all undeveloped or scheduled books were cancelled until further notice. While waiting for a confirmation, Luceno was supportive over the book's fate and followed up with Lucas Publishing. The subsequent cancellation of The Clone Wars and the end of the Expanded Universe caused the project to be officially scrapped. Del Rey retained their publishing license, however, for books that fell within the new canon, and several of those books were announced on April 25, including Tarkin by James Luceno. The project had been pitched to Luceno in summer 2013 while he was trying to develop a novel about Emperor Palpatine set between Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back that would continue the story from Darth Plagueis. He felt like he was failing to get anywhere with the Palpatine novel, but he realized that if he could set Tarkin early enough in the Imperial era he could push forward the stories of Palpatine and Darth Vader while still focusing the book on Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin. Although he was initially worried that the Tarkin character would not resonate with casual readers, the challenge eventually became a delight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luceno had been interested in Tarkin from his first viewing of Star Wars and believed that the character was as emblematic of the Empire as the Death Star itself, as he casually destroyed planets and possessed ruthless self-assurance that prevented him from acknowledging that the Death Star was fatally flawed. Luceno had a number of questions about who he was and where he came from, and he had discussed the character considerably with Brian Daley after first seeing the film, trying to pin down where Tarkin stood in the Imperial hierarchy. Luceno had felt that Tarkin was one of the Empire's elites and also likely one of its architects, and he and Daley had wondered how the character maintained what seemed like a genuine friendship with Darth Vader. That friendship and the fact that Tarkin was in command of the Empire's ultimate weapon provided a jumping off point for what Luceno wanted to do with the novel\u2014to explore those aspects, he would need to explore Tarkin's past. He thus had a rough idea of the story and its timeline placement when he went to Skywalker Ranch for a conference with the Story Group in October of 2013, which touched off a number of discussions, including one about the character's past. Luceno did not want to make Tarkin too similar to Palpatine by having him come from a wealthy background, so a suggestion was made by Story Group member Pablo Hidalgo that he come from a colonial planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That idea gave Luceno a completely new take on where Tarkin had come from. Although in Star Wars he had been cultured, dignified, intelligent and entitled, the colonial concept introduced the idea that he grew up on an Outer Rim planet and had to work hard to be accepted by the Core elite. Luceno had met colonials who had been raised in Tanzania and Kenya during his travels in East Africa, and he used them as a jumping off point for Tarkin. He did not find the brainstorming session with the Story Group to be any different from his past experiences, as, in his own words, \"There's always been a story group.\" His Tarkin meeting at Skywalker Ranch proceeded in the same laid-back manner as his previous novel meetings in that he sat down with a story group and talked Star Wars over coffee and doughnuts, with the only difference being a few new faces. They discussed what would be happening in Star Wars Rebels and in upcoming bonus episodes of The Clone Wars\u2014he was even allowed to read the Rebels series bible and some of the show's scripts\u2014and Luceno left the meeting feeling like the Story Group was not trying to steer him away from any of the ideas he had for his book. He thought about Tarkin for another few months before coming up with a formal outline."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The re-branding of the Expanded Universe as \"Legends\" did not cause Luceno to feel constrained, as the lore still existed for him to reference if he so chose. The planet Murkhana and the character of Armand Isard fit into roles that were a part of the story he was writing, so he included them instead of inventing something new, and he also mentioned the Eriadu Conference from his earlier novel Cloak of Deception, among other Legends references. Some references he cleared with the Story Group beforehand, but with some he went with his gut and they ended up making it through the editing process. Minor cuts were made by the editors, and they asked him to change the species of several characters, but Luceno did not find it to be an intrusive process. Aware of his reputation for adding too much exposition to his books, he self-edited and trimmed away many non-essential references and tried not to shoehorn too many characters into the novel. He did not feel that the Expanded Universe was lessened in any way and hoped that readers could enjoy reading about and embrace two different versions of certain events, much like the multiple versions of the quest for the Holy Grail. He personally was not ready to dismiss the Expanded Universe, and he did not want fans to ignore all of its good storytelling, acknowledging that some of them felt frustrated due the re-branding of the EU as Legends, which Luceno shrugged off as Disney's decision."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Dark Times open to new exploration in Star Wars fiction, Luceno reflected on how to portray the era and ultimately decided to focus on the Empire's military might, in contrast to Darth Plagueis being about economic and political manipulation. Five years after the Clone Wars, he wrote the Emperor as still consolidating power and determining whom he could trust as the Empire worked to gain control over the galaxy. He was conscious of John Jackson Miller's A New Dawn, which was being written simultaneously and was set several years later, as it was portraying the Empire as already being a much tighter organization. Luceno was keeping abreast of Miller's outline submissions and his conversations with both the Story Group and with Dave Filoni. Setting Tarkin shortly after the events of Revenge of the Sith allowed Luceno to provide a snapshot of the early days of the Empire and to give an origin story for Tarkin set years before his time as commander of the Death Star, that would hopefully suggest the character who ends up appearing in A New Hope. He aimed to assert that Tarkin's casual disregard for life when destroying Alderaan was based less on him being a psychopath and more on him being an instrument of Imperial authority. Luceno believed that Tarkin's arrogance was a peculiar kind, in that he saw himself as part of an elite and chosen master race who need to supervise lesser groups by keeping them in check in order to prevent chaos and lawlessness. That arrogance stemmed from Tarkin having survived in a certain way."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That \"certain way\" was a series of challenges and initiations that commenced in Tarkin's life at the age of eleven, gradually shaping his worldview and morphing him into a callous commander. Running with the colonial idea, Luceno devised the idea of a young Tarkin undergoing harsh trials in the wilderness of his homeworld of Eriadu, viewing the circle of life and death as a trap and seeing nature as a battle for survival instead of finding the Force and goodness in it the way a Jedi might. Escape could only be achieved by fighting one's way to the top of the food chain, which instilled in Tarkin the idea that blunt force and ruling by fear were the proper responses to fighting chaos. These attributes of Tarkin's led Luceno to consider him the Star Wars equivalent of Heinrich Himmler or Hermann G\u00f6ring. Other historical figures that inspired his writing of the character included Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, Oliver Cromwell, Adrian Carton de Wiart, James J. Andrews, Julie d'Aubigny, Anne Bonny, and George Armstrong Custer. He also studied Tarkin actor Peter Cushing's performances in old Hammer Horror films, as well as his roles as Dr. Who and Sherlock Holmes, in an effort to capture his voice and mannerisms. Luceno studied similar movies for a scene with Christopher Lee's Count Dooku, and he enjoyed imagining the two actors playing off of each other just as they had in so many classic horror movies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Other inspirations for the novel included a photo Luceno had taken in the 1970s of a pride of lions basking atop a rocky outcropping while traveling in Africa\u2014looking like the lords of everything that they surveyed, the animals were a basis for Tarkin's rite of passage in the Eriadu wilds. The character of Jova, Tarkin's great-uncle and wilderness guide, was an amalgamation of several people Luceno had met during his early travels in Africa and the Americas, particularly a Belizean in Guatemala who would view every venomous animal in the forest as a potential enemy and would kill every one he came across. The inclusion of the former Jedi Temple as the new Imperial Palace came from discussions with the Story Group, leading Luceno to be given some artwork that showed the Palace, which had a line of structures going around it, five years after Palpatine proclaimed himself emperor during the early era of the Empire. The book also establishes that the Jedi Temple was built atop an ancient Sith shrine, which was based on historical examples such as Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s building churches on the sites of razed Aztec shrines in the conquered city of Tenochtitlan. Additionally, sources such as Ryder Windham's Death Star Owner's Technical Manual were consulted when Luceno decided to have the battle station be a looming and nebulous background threat in the story."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Vader was a character to whom Luceno deliberately did not give a point of view, as he liked the idea of the reader projecting their own feelings onto him and also wanted to keep Tarkin guessing about what Vader's reactions were. Without a face with which to show emotion, Vader struck him as a living Rorschach test, and he wanted the character to instead be depicted by his words and actions. In writing about Tarkin's relationship with Vader, Luceno considered that in A New Hope, Tarkin isn't surprised to hear that Obi-Wan Kenobi is Vader's former Master and thus likely knows a lot about Vader's past. He and the Story Group figured that Tarkin had suspicions about Vader and outright believed that he was indeed Anakin Skywalker. He used several episodes of The Clone Wars as a jumping-off point for their relationship\u2014a trilogy of episodes from the show's third season had depicted the beginning of the characters' relationship, while the end of the fifth season had seen Tarkin prosecuting Skywalker's Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, for murder. The latter story allowed Luceno to have their relationship begin on a negative note, with Tarkin believing that Vader held a grudge against him for attempting to convict his apprentice. Despite that, he felt that Tarkin referring to Vader as \"my friend\" in A New Hope had a measure of truth to it, suggesting that the two had a shared history and deep personal respect for each other. Tarkin's role in The Clone Wars also revealed to Luceno a character who was more calculating than merely ruthless, and more informed about the Empire than merely subservient to it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While he was writing the book, Luceno was asked by the Story Group if he was interested in revealing Palpatine's first name, Sheev, a name that George Lucas had developed for the long-gestating live-action Star Wars television series, Star Wars: Underworld. The choice of first name was a head-scratcher for him and not what he had expected for the character, as he was accustomed to thinking in terms of Greco-Roman names for Star Wars characters that offered a knowing wink to their possessors' nature. He did figure it could suggest concepts like Shiva or a shiv and ultimately did not have a problem with it, but he still worried that it would be too much of a show-stopper if it appeared in the book. After realizing that the name would eventually get used, Luceno agreed, deciding it would be a name that Palpatine would reveal as a means of bringing others into his inner circle. The name caused a large stir online when it was leaked in advance of Tarkin's release, which surprised Luceno by blowing up into something he had not expected."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Palpatine's ultimate endgame was something about which Luceno had been thinking for several years, having written much about both the character and the dark side. He felt that it had to be about more than just immortality, perhaps something akin to winning the Game of Thrones or \"covering the lands in a second darkness\" like Sauron in The Lord of the Rings, or even something wholly new in science fiction and fantasy due to Star Wars's uniqueness from those kinds of franchises. He accordingly toyed with the idea of Palpatine using the dark side to reshape reality to match his own dark designs, and what he ended up writing on the subject came as a surprise to him. It was something Luceno wanted to explore more fully in the future, and he felt that there was room for a concluding chapter to the rough trilogy begun by Darth Plagueis and continued by Tarkin, focusing on Palpatine's attainment of ultimate metaphysical power and his belief that the final showdown between light and dark must be waged in an otherworldly dimension."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tarkin's nemeses in the book were a group of rebel hijackers, whom Luceno wanted to be unlike a typical band of insurgents and so peppered with character types such as media personnel and former spies. He also wanted their actions to fall outside of a black-and-white moral dichotomy, with the book asking if they were \"good guys\" but not actually providing an answer. He also admitted that they were in some sense a MacGuffin used to facilitate interactions between the story's various Imperial characters. Political intrigue trumped customary Star Wars space battles in order to keep the focus on Tarkin, but when a battle did occur, Luceno always tried to keep the character as close to the action as possible. He worried if the space battles would be too tonally different from the rest of the book, and he did not feel totally confident with the novel until he handed off a first draft to Del Rey. In all, he had about six months from Tarkin's conception to the draft's submission, and although he worried that the novel was too short, he believed it was complete and did not seek to expand anything before submitting it. After receiving feedback from Del Rey, he tightened up some scenes and added several more. Tarkin was released in hardcover on November 4, 2014, and while promoting the book that month, Luceno expressed a hope to soon travel to some recently excavated Mayan sites in southern Mexico. Tarkin was reprinted in October 2015 in the compendium The Rise of the Empire, which also included A New Dawn and three exclusive short stories."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Going Rogue"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In December 2014, Luceno reflected in an interview that the plots of most of the Star Wars prequels had been spoiled for him because of the direct tie-in novels he had written, and that it would be nice if he could go into 2015's Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens without any advance knowledge. However, the film's story was revealed to him in April 2015 during Star Wars Celebration Anaheim, and he went on to read the script prior to the movie's release. The Force Awakens opened in December 2015, and its planets and locations were added to an updated version of 2005's Star Wars: Complete Locations. The book included all previous editions of the Inside the Worlds of series, including Luceno's Inside the Worlds of Star Wars Trilogy, and was published on September 27, 2016. The reprinting of Luceno's earlier material brought some elements of Star Wars Legends into the new canon, such as Ackmena the bartender, who had first appeared in 1978's The Star Wars Holiday Special. A much bigger Star Wars event in 2016 was the theatrical release of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, the first film in the Star Wars Anthology Series, a collection of movies that would explore characters and events beyond the main episodic saga. In 2015, Luceno was hired to write Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel, a lead-in to the movie, and he was granted access to both the story treatment and shooting script of Rogue One. During meetings with the Story Group, he was shown film art and some early footage, and the book began to develop in parallel with the film. Input on the novel was received from the people making the movie."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Just as he had done with his earlier tie-ins, Luceno asked himself where Rogue One's full story began\u2014although he felt that the movie was complete and did not beg for any backstory, he saw Catalyst as being a book for fans who wanted added detail. Although there was no single line in the film that hinted at a specific past event, the movie made it clear that two of its characters, Galen Erso and Orson Krennic, had a prior relationship, and Luceno made it his business to reveal that relationship. He wrote them as having met before the Clone Wars while part of a Republic-sponsored program for young geniuses, giving them a sort of \"college buddies\" vibe that Pablo Hidalgo compared to the film The Social Network. Luceno initially wanted to cover a number of bases with the book and feature a large cast of characters, including Count Dooku and the Emperor, but on considering the way that the film was developing, he dialed down his ambition and made Catalyst less broad and more of a smaller-scale character-driven novel. He focused on the relationships between a select few individuals: Krennic, Erso, and Erso's wife Lyra and daughter Jyn. Rogue One featured an older Jyn as its protagonist, and Luceno believed that showing her parents' dynamic was important because they both played a role in shaping who Jyn would become. His mission was to inform Rogue One instead of mimicking or spoiling it, and to include an appropriate amount of foreshadowing despite the book being set decades earlier."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to get a sense of how Mads Mikkelsen and Ben Mendelsohn\u2014the actors playing Erso and Krennic, respectively\u2014operated, Luceno studied some of their other movies, keeping a close eye on their diction and body movement. He initially assumed that Mikkelsen was playing Krennic, the villain, before being corrected, and Mendelsohn's Krennic ended up being an interesting villain for him to write. Krennic was unlike a Sith and he was not as calculating as Tarkin; he had a gambler's mentality and could find people's tells, and he was a liar and a manipulator who would do anything to get his way. Those qualities, combined with his volatility, rendered him a unique antagonist, but Luceno made an effort to write his younger version as being less brash and volatile. Luceno included Tarkin in Catalyst and enjoyed putting him together with Krennic on account of their different methods of getting things done. His plot required an additional foil for Krennic, however, and he created the Dressellian smuggler Has Obitt, who played an important role in Krennic's scheming."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rogue One was not the only work whose influence loomed large over the writing of Catalyst, as Luceno also treated it as a prequel to his earlier novel, Tarkin. That book had had him thinking about the early days of the Empire and its transition from the Old Republic, and how members of the Imperial Court would be jockeying for position in the Emperor's inner circle. That concept lent itself well to the rivalry between Krennic and Governor Tarkin, as did the construction of the Death Star, which was central to Catalyst's plot and which Luceno believed would affect the long-term goals of career militarists and politicians like Krennic and Tarkin. He enjoyed depicting the earliest stages of the weapon's conception, which he thought could tie into the idea of Palpatine having a far-reaching plan\u2014a future novel about Palpatine was still on his radar\u2014 and he heavily researched The Manhattan Project, which seemed to him like an appropriate real-world analogue to the Death Star. Like the Republic, the United States and United Kingdom had spearheaded the development of a major weapon due to fears that their enemy was already creating one of their own."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Erso was written as a conscientious objector to the Death Star project, whom Luceno compared to a scientist who would say \"No way\" to working on the atomic bomb. As Luceno could not find any Manhattan Project scientists who had rejected the call of duty, however, he had to look to other historical influences for Erso's character. He also got a better handle on writing Krennic when he found out that Erso would be a subject of Krennic's manipulations. Erso's wife, Lyra, was described by Luceno as \"the person who keeps the genius Galen grounded,\" and he wrote her as a confident and physical foil to her cerebral and antisocial husband, who loves him despite their differences and who helps him communicate with the outside world. In early meetings with the Story Group, it was decided that Lyra would somehow be in touch with the Force without being outright Force-sensitive. Another important character in Catalyst is Rogue One's Saw Gerrera\u2014Luceno originally wanted to give him a large role, but some discussions decided that he should instead be developed in other Rogue One\u2013related projects. Ultimately, people directly involved with the movie wanted him to appear at the end of the novel, and Luceno was then given permission during rewrites to use him extensively after all."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Without seeing any footage of the character, he needed some help finding the voice of a younger Gerrera. Other help came in the form of inspiration from his travels, and locations in Ethiopia and Bolivia made their way into the novel, the former being a low-lying volcanic region that seemed perfectly suited to one of Catalyst's settings. Regarding other sources of inspiration, Luceno indicated in an interview that he was still operating very much from a Legends basis while writing the book. Catalyst was released in hardcover on November 15, 2016, but earlier that year Luceno took a trip to Kenya and became interested in African history. In 2018, his work on Revenge of the Sith The Visual Dictionary made it into the Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary, New Edition, which included material from the newest Star Wars films."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Future possibilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In regards to his long-planned novel centered on Emperor Palpatine between Episodes IV and V, Luceno has noted that it's an idea he really hopes to carry forward at some point although he has yet to be commissioned to write it, speculating that his proposal could be possibly rendered obsolete by new elements from the sequel episodes. Luceno has also stated that he would like to write a story set during the Old Republic-era because there are some interesting things he can do with the early Jedi Knights."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Writing style and influences"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He has kept himself up to date with the Star Wars Expanded Universe throughout the years, reading books, comics, and Wookieepedia entries and making notes along the way, doing so both for work and as a fan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luceno feels that continuity is extremely important, believing that the more a universe can be fleshed out in a real way, the more rewarding the reading experience. That mindset came from his work with Robotech, when he and Daley were required to keep their books' continuity as close to the original animation as possible. By paying attention to continuity, he tries to make the Star Wars universe as realistic as possible, and a universe that the reader knows well. He has likened writing Star Wars fiction to inhabiting a big world where lots of events have already taken place, and he references those events in order to make the world feel more realistic. He also draws on visually interesting characters in an effort to make his books visual and film-like."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "His travels have frequently informed his writing, and locations from countries like Nepal, Tanzania, and Ethiopia have inspired settings in his Star Wars novels."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When writing for Star Wars, he is always thinking about the fans and what they would like to read. Some of his favorite Star Wars scenes to write were the Jedi taking back Coruscant from the Yuuzhan Vong in The Unifying Force, and when he tried to imagine in Dark Lord what it would be like for Anakin Skywalker to wake up in the Darth Vader suit for the first time. Much like Brian Daley did, he believes it is important for droids to be given a point of view, as much of the Star Wars saga is known through droid characters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Comparing the experiences of writing an original novel and writing tie-in fiction for a franchise like Star Wars, Luceno has described the former as much more organic, with stories and characters growing from carefully nurtured seeds. He has likened the latter scenario to writing historical fiction, with its established characters and strict rules. Luceno has expressed a preference for writing in the Star Wars prequel era, which he feels is epic and operatic, and full of rich and almost melodramatic language."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Published works"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
