When Marcolf was installed as the interim magistrate of the city, Patriarch Tumris agreed to the posting but came to view it ruefully when Jedi Warde never returned to settle the contested reeveship. Over time, Tumris hated the Jedi and Marcolf for interfering with Quolas politics; he believed his family would have triumphed in their contest with the Helshars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Tumris was not self-motivated, he was open to the idea of mobilizing a strike against the dictatorial rule of Reeve Marcolf.
