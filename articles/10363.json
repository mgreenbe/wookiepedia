The two vessels rendezvoused in a quadruple star system, but one was unable to travel further. The working ship entered the territory of the Chiss Ascendancy, but the Nikardun located it at its exit point in the Dioya system due to its Void Guide navigator and destroyed it. The Chiss witnessed the incident, but had their attention drawn away when the Nikardun orchestrated a Paataatus attack on the Chiss homeworld of Csilla. Senior Captain Mitth'raw'nuruodo, looking into the attack on Csilla, investigated the wreckage in the Dioya system, leading to his discovery of the Nikardun conquests."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
