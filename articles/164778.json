The group protested the treatment of workers by large corporations, primarily those in the Yellow District of Falleen's capital city, Falleen Throne, as well as the dumping of toxic waste produced by the corporations on the planet. In 24 BBY the group attempted to enter the headquarters of the Blackwater Systems corporation to uncover secrets that they were hiding from the workers. Before they could enter the building, Blackwater released droids to kill the leader of the group."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
