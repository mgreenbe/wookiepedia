The Knight was one of many who acted as a bodyguard to the Emperor in that year as he secretly rendezvoused with representatives of the Jedi Order on the planet Agamar. The two groups met on the planet's grassy plains, and every Imperial Knight and Jedi dressed in a farmer disguise. Several Imperial Knight Masters stood with Fel as he and the Jedi Master K'Kruhk negotiated an alliance against the Sith Lord Darth Krayt's Empire; the light-haired Knight and a group of other Imperial Knights stood away from the proceedings and furthered their farmer deception by pretending to tend to a nearby field. After Fel and K'Kruhk struck an agreement, the talks were interrupted by Nyna Calixte\u2014the Director of Imperial Intelligence for Krayt's Empire\u2014who was secretly an ally of Fel's."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As she rode a local animal into the field where the light-haired Knight stood, Calixte was knocked to the ground when two Imperial Knights fired blaster rifles at the beast.

A Sith strike team emerged from nearby swamps, and the Jedi and Imperial Knights jettisoned their farmer disguises as a battle began. When Antares Draco, the leader of the Imperial Knights, called on his Knights to defend their Emperor, the light-haired Knight ignited a lightsaber. Every Jedi and Imperial Knight began to fight off the attacking Sith in an effort to protect Fel, and at least ten Sith fell to their enemies' blades and to Calixte's blaster.
