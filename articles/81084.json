Instead, this alerted the rebels to the Imperial presence and gave them a chance to raise a shield over Echo Base, their secret headquarters. With the shield preventing Lennox and the other Death Squadron captains from carrying out an orbital bombardment, the Imperial Blizzard Force was deployed to the planet for a ground assault.

With its shields down, the shots disabled Lennox's vessel, taking out its missile launchers and conning tower and causing it to veer, then career into deep space helplessly as Quantum Storm and its escort slipped past and escaped the system. The Empire ultimately claimed victory in the Battle of Hoth, but many rebels escaped through the blockade.
