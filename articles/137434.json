It was a flat computer that could be coupled to a special sensor array to record accurate geographical information as the scout moved across uncharted terrain by bouncing electromagnetic rays off a scout vessel in orbit. The mapping features of the datapad were also uninterrupted by the scout using it to call up preloaded encyclopedic information."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
