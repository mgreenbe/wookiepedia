Initially, clone flametroopers were outfitted with MK I insulated armor, but was severely flawed in that it didn't have sufficient respirator filtration. When the problem was quickly fixed in the MK II \"Hotspot\" Insulated Armor, it provided a morale boost to the flame trooper corps. Members of the flame trooper corps participated in the Second Battle of Geonosis, where they served under Clone Commander CC-1993 \"Jet\" alongside special ops clone troopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
