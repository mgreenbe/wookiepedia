Djarin discovered that the Mandalorian he was seeking was actually the local sheriff Cobb Vanth, who had earlier claimed Boba Fett's armor and wore it in defense of the town of Mos Pelgo. A deal was struck between Djarin and Vanth in which Vanth would give Djarin the armor if Djarin helped slay a local greater krayt dragon. Djarin, Vanth, the citizens of Mos Pelgo, and members of a nearby tribe of Tusken Raiders banded together to take down the krayt dragon that had been terrorizing their region of the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
