The six engines, though hardy and compact, only offered the A-1 Deluxe a top speed of 160 kph; this left each individual engine max speed at approximately 27 kph. The engines also ran very hot, and relied on cooling shrouds to protect passengers while entering and exiting the A-1."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
