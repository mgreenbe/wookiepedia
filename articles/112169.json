He was a member of the prominent House of Antilles and the uncle of Corla Metonae. Although he belonged to the same family as Breha, Queen of Alderaan, he himself held no title. During his formative years, Antilles learned how to pilot under the guidance of his mentor, Captain Jeremoch Colton."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rise of the Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the time of the Clone Wars, Raymus Antilles had reached the rank of captain and was entrusted with piloting the Sundered Heart, the consular vessel for Senator Bail Prestor Organa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the transmission of Order 66, Captain Antilles recovered a Jedi homing beacon, encountering no opposition from clone troopers as they were still confused by the ordeal. The beacon helped Bail Organa locate Jedi Masters Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi.

He took that ship for some of his most dangerous missions instead of the Tantive IV. In 1 BBY, he gave his support to the Star Tours travel agency, which was being re\u2013launched under new management. To assist in the preparations for the first flight from the brand new Spaceport THX1138, Captain Antilles assigned C-3PO and R2-D2 to temporarily work for the company. However, after the first flight was ambushed by Imperial forces conducting a raid on THX1138 and the escorting of a Rebel agent to the Rebels, he quietly had C-3PO and R2-D2 returned to him from Star Tours."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While on Dantooine, Antilles lost R2-D2 in a game of sabacc against the Lorrdian Pike Angeles. Angeles, a technician who wanted to be deployed in the field, agreed to return the astromech in exchange for a field commission. Antilles agreed. R2-D2 returned to his custody and Pike Angeles was free to begin a career stealing starships for the Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the battle of Kuat that same year, Antilles personally destroyed six Imperial shipyards in orbit of the planet, in order to begin the operation of stealing the X-wing prototypes. He also attacked a fleet of Imperial ships transporting Incom scientists to the spice mines of Kessel, saving them from certain death. He was involved in many other missions for the Rebel cause. Later, while back in command of the Tantive IV, he was part of the mission which intercepted plans for the Death Star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Tatooine, he commanded Blue Squadron from the bridge of the Tantive IV. His passage through the system was interrupted when a nearby Interdictor cruiser activated its gravity well projector, preventing their escape and allowing the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Devastator to capture his ship. As the ship was boarded, Antilles led his men into the main passageway, meeting Leia Organa. He ordered her into an escape pod, as she had the Death Star plans. The senator suggested they use a droid instead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 501st Legion stormed the ship, and he was captured and taken to Darth Vader. The Sith Lord strangled Antilles to death (without the Force) after he refused to give information on the location of the Death Star plans, and attempted to claim that the Tantive IV was a consular ship on a diplomatic mission. Angered by Antilles's refusal to give up the location of the plans, as well as Antilles's death just as Vader demanded to know where the \"ambassador\" of the ship was due to his crushing his neck, the Dark Lord threw his body against a wall."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Raymus Antilles was level-headed, schooled in diplomacy, and a capable pilot. He was a strong Rebel Alliance sympathizer and skilled at running Imperial blockades, but he lacked experience leading ground troops.
