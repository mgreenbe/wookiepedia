By the time the Republic were in front of the Factory, Poggle had ten garrisons of B1-series battle droids ready to be deployed. In addition, twenty new Super tanks were ready deployed. Poggle deployed the garrisons and super tanks against the Jedi General Luminara Unduli's 41st Elite Corps and Anakin Skywalker's 501st Legion. During this time, Jedi Commanders and Barriss Offee and Ahsoka Tano were able to infiltrate the factory through the catacombs and plant bombs on the factory's main generator. Unfortunately, a Geonosian informed Poggle and TX-21 of this and took a super tank to stop them. The Jedi commanders were able to destroy the super tanks drivers, but lost the bombs to the Geonosians. Offee and Tano decided to use the super tank to destroy the generator and factory. They survived the explosion and were found by their masters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
