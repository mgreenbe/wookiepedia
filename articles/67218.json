Ramil allowed pirates to repeatedly raid Serenno, and its Great Houses called in Abyssin mercenaries to protect them due to Ramil's inaction. Ramil subsequently bought out the mercenaries, who took control of Serenno and its capital city, Carannia. Lady Jenza, sister of Ramil, led a resistance group of Serennian refugees against the Abyssin, requesting help from her other brother, the Jedi Master Dooku. With Dooku's help, the refugees began to regain control of Serenno, but Ramil dispatched his droid army to end the supposed insurrection. Dooku allowed the droids to take him to face Ramil aboard the airship Windrunner, where he killed the Count and disabled his army. Following Ramil's death, the Abyssin retreated, and Dooku departed from the Jedi Order, proclaiming himself as the new Count of Serenno."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
