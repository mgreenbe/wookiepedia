It was designed to be used alongside a restraint harness and possibly an emergency acceleration compensator in order to prevent the pilot from hitting a hard surface during the sudden deceleration of a crash. The Skiprays owned by Talon Karrde while he had a base on Myrkr were equipped with crash balloons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This is the Star Wars analog to the real-world airbags used in cars and other passenger vehicles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
