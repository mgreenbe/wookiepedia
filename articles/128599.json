Considered the planet's cosmopolitan center, Sood was larger than Eluthan, and served as the planet's capital city. Sood was distinguished by its new structures and business concentration, which set it apart from the more old-world environment of Eluthan. During the era of the Clone Wars, all the cities of Acherin suffered greatly, but none more than Sood. When the Galactic Empire abandoned Acherin after the end of the Clone Wars, the leaders of Sood launched attacks on the natives of Eluthan, in an effort to gain control of the planet's meager remaining resources."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
