Although Kreia's desire to gain a full understanding of the essence of the Force made her submit herself to the dark side of the Force and eventually becoming the bitter Sith Lord Darth Traya, (pronounced /t\u0279e\u026aj\u0259/) as well as her consolidation of a Sith Order from other fallen Jedi, Kreia was betrayed once more by her own Sith apprentices, leading her to set aside the Force's dark side and take on a quest of cleansing. The former Darth Traya found the Jedi Exile, a Human female named Meetra Surik, whom Kreia took on as her teacher. Through the Exile, Kreia brought down the Jedi still remaining from the Sith's purge previously initiated by her, the remnants of her Sith Order, and an emerging Sith\u2014the Jedi Master Atris\u2014before ultimately completing Surik's training by forcing the exiled Jedi to let her die."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kreia was a Jedi Master and historian who was exiled by the Jedi High Council because her students followed the Jedi Knight Revan, her former Padawan, to wage war against Mandalorians invading the Galactic Republic. Revan turned the resulting Mandalorian Wars into a series of conversion of Jedi to the dark side, covertly building the foundations of a Sith Empire by overwhelming Jedi Knights with the power of the dark side, which was fuelled by warfare and mass death; the wars culminated in a battle over the Sith world of Malachor V, in which the activation of the Mass Shadow Generator at Jedi General Meetra Surik's command eliminated nearly all Jedi and Mandalorian combatants; however, due to Surik's fear, she unconsciously cut herself off from the Force whilst carrying all the deaths and suffering of Malachor with her, becoming a void in the Force.

While Revan was made amnesiac and retrained by the Jedi, he rediscovered his memories and left the Jedi for the Unknown Regions in search of the True Sith. After Kreia withdrew from the Jedi, she retraced Revan's footsteps to Malachor V, being drawn to its echoes in the Force after the civil war. There, she discovered the Trayus Academy and turned to the dark side of the Force. Taking up the mantle Darth Traya, the former Jedi Master searched for other wounds in the Force, and discovered two men who became her apprentices, Darth Sion and Darth Nihilus. With the two, she formed and became the Dark Lord of the Sith Triumvirate, at war with the Jedi and ruling over the remnants of Revan's Sith forces left from the Jedi Civil War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Traya was overthrown by Sion and Nihilus, who stripped their Sith Master of her connection to the Force. After having been exiled by both the Jedi and Sith, she held an abhorrence of how both Orders were used by the Force to its own ends, and began to consider how she might rid the galaxy of its influence forever. Taking on the name \"Kreia\" once more, the former Darth Traya located Meetra Surik, the Jedi Exile. As the only individual who detached herself from the Force, the Exile was seen by Kreia as having the potential to bring her purpose to fruition, and took it upon herself to rescue and teach Surik."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Kreia and the Exile acquainted with each other, the latter, who easily formed powerful bonds in the Force with others, grew attached to her mentor to the extent of becoming symbionts.

Dictating that as the Exile easily bonded with others, others grew easily attached to the Exile, who carried all the pain and suffering and death of Malachor, and as such, all those who lived around the Exile were susceptible to becoming imbalanced as they shared their fates with the fate of the Exile, who was free from the Force's will."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Frustrated at the Master's blindness, Kreia revealed her identity as the former Sith Lord Darth Traya and in turn passed judgment on the Jedi, severing their bonds to the Force. As they were themselves too attached to the Force, the Jedi died, passing on from the Living Force to the Cosmic Force. Shortly after, Kreia traveled to the secret Jedi Academy on Telos IV and exposed Jedi Master Atris' fall to the dark side. Atris finally admitted that she herself had fallen to the grasps of the dark side of the Force, accepting that her darkness betrayed herself. The new \"Darth Traya,\" as Kreia referred to Atris, thus did what the other Master could not; she embraced the dark side. However, Atris was then confronted by Meetra Surik. After Surik persuaded Atris to let go of her false Jedi teachings and leave to find her human self once more, the Exile destroyed Darth Nihilus over Telos.

Asserting her dominance over Darth Sion, Kreia made preparations for the Exile's final test\u2014the death of the past at the echo itself. After the Jedi Exile made her way through the numerous Sith minions on Malachor, she found Kreia at the Trayus Core. Kreia stated that her goal was to free the galaxy from the Force's influence, for she hated its control of every being's destiny. Kreia told Meetra Surik that she must let go of everything other than herself to achieve her full potential: to be an individual, to live and be herself. Kreia then went on to deliver her ultimatum: the Exile must either kill her, or she would kill the Exile. Thus, the Jedi Exile was forced to betray her master as her master did her, thus severing their ties and letting go of each other. Ultimately, the Exile defeated Kreia in the depths of the Trayus Academy, granting Kreia death per the mentor's will.

With the concomitance of discovering that all of Kreia's pupils either fell to the dark side of the Force or abandoned their Jedi training, Atris led the Council in denouncing Kreia and condemning her \"freethinking\" teachings.

Kreia said that the assassins aboard were those who attacked the Ebon Hawk, and they arrived quicker than she expected. Together with Atton Rand, the exile deduced that the docked ship must possess the asteroid orbital drift charts to needed to plot a safe course through the Peragus asteroid field, and the trio boarded the Harbinger to take the codes, desperate to escape death.

After probing Atton Rand's mind against his will and learning of his dark deeds, Kreia used the knowledge of Atton's past to blackmail him into Meetra Surik's service. She also tempted Mandalore the Preserver with information of Revan's fate in order to ensure that he would not betray Surik."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Additionally, the former Sith Triumvirate leader demonstrated an exceptional talent at manipulation and deception that she used to further her own agenda. Kreia lied to Surik at the beginning of their quest, claiming that the Jedi Council had stripped her of the Force. She knew that the lie would lead Surik to seek out the surviving members of the Jedi Council, in hopes that she herself, or Surik, would prove them wrong on their teachings. On Onderon, Kreia lied to Tobin about the existence of many Jedi in the Jedi Academy on Telos. She knew that Tobin secretly served Darth Nihilus, and thus she lied to him so that Nihilus would be tricked into assaulting Telos to replenish his power, successfully maneuvering her former Sith apprentice into a vulnerable position against an assault from Surik and the Mandalorians.

On intimate relationships, Kreia saw that such passions were not strength, but erosion, though she withheld ultimate judgement on the matter. She also remonstrated Surik for taking on the challenges of others, arguing that compassion weakened the benefactors by depriving them of the mental and physical enrichment that life's challenges procure. Not only did Kreia find acts of compassion committed without regards to consequence to be pathetic, to her it was also ironic since it weakened the very people it was intended to help, \"cheapening\" their experiences and leaving them more ill-prepared for dealing with difficulties on their own. Despite her cold and callous persona, Kreia possessed a softer side to her personality that was more apparent when she was mentoring Surik."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kreia loved Meetra Surik as a person to the point where she would have been willing to sacrifice the entire galaxy if it meant preserving her.

Kreia also referred to the droids who traveled with Surik\u2014T3-M4, HK-47, and G0-T0\u2014as \"machines.\" Before Atton Rand's Force-sensitivity was discovered by Surik, Kreia possessed a small amount of respect for him.

As she despised the Jedi Council for its hubris, she detested the Mandalorians for possessing the arrogance to believe that they could defeat those who made use of the Force. During Surik's alliance with Mandalore the Preserver, Kreia took every opportunity to remind the Mandalorians of their inferiority against the Forceful Jedi and Sith. She saw them as simple-minded fools for constantly underestimating the Force. Ultimately, Kreia perceived the Mandalorians as nothing more than common soldiers who could never triumph over the Jedi, for their military \"tactics\" were nothing in comparison to the power of the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kreia also displayed skepticism of artificial intelligence. Although she regarded Revan as \"power itself\" and one of her finest pupils, Kreia could not understand Revan's fascination with \"things dead to the Force\" such as machines and technology.

Hence, she felt that Revan would have loved nothing more than to have \"human droids\" like Surik in service to him\u2014one who was dead to the Force, an empty shell that would carry out his orders without question. Due to her lack of trust in droids, Kreia treated T3-M4 with disdain and begrudging tolerance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aside from droids, Kreia put up a distinctive mask of mild intolerance towards non-Human species.

She strongly believed in the will of the Force, viewing it as a conscious entity that controlled the destiny of all living beings. Thus, she knew the Force as a deity that gave no regard to individual wills, and sought to rid all sentients from its control. However, with her power and connection to the Force stripped away by Sion and Nihilus, who have been consumed by the dark side of the Force, Kreia turned to Meetra Surik. The fact that Surik was virtually the exact opposite of Revan had been what drew Kreia to the Exile. Whereas Revan was \"the heart of the Force\" in Kreia's eyes, Surik was \"the death of the Force.\" Thus, Kreia hoped to use the Exile to destroy both the Jedi and the Sith and form a synthesis of both dichotomous idealogies. At the end of the Exile's quest to find the Lost Jedi, Kreia stripped away their bonds to the Force, thus killing them in their inability to let go. In orchestrating her student's confrontation with Atris, the fallen Jedi Master's teachings are foiled, and along with the defeat of Darth Nihilus over Telos, the Sith Revan formed were no more save for those on Malachor V, who were dispatched by Surik as she convinced Darth Sion to let go of his suffering and life.

Even during her years as a Jedi, Kreia's views were perceived as unorthodox, and she often put forth questions that challenged and deconstructed the traditional interpretations of both the Jedi and the Force itself. While wandering the galaxy, Kreia refined her beliefs, eventually coming to view the Force as being a power that, by nature, used everything as pawns in a pernicious game of balance without regard to sentient lives. This, Kreia thought, was evidenced by the widespread occurrences of destruction and death that had persistently transpired throughout the galaxy to that point, many of which could be traced to a conflict between Force-sensitives. Yet, Kreia blamed neither the Jedi nor the Sith, but rather, the very thing they had both come to draw and rely upon: the Force itself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After being exiled from the Jedi Order, when she was forced to shoulder the blame for Revan's corruption, and again after she as Darth Traya was exiled from Malachor V by Sion and Nihilus, Kreia had experienced betrayals from, and saw the flaws of both the Jedi and the Sith. These unique experiences disillusioned her, forcing her to refine her ways of thinking. When she heard about Meetra Surik, she saw proof that life could exist without the Force, which she saw as disproof of the traditional dogma of both the Sith and Jedi that the Force and life itself were inseparable by nature. This renewed Kreia's confidence in her personal beliefs, and fueled her desire to learn more of the Exile's personal motivations. In her adventures with Surik, Kreia had discovered that certain tragedies could leave wounds in the Force, which sometimes made it difficult to hear and be used. These \"echoes,\" as Kreia called them. Her discovery was due in no small part to Surik, as her experience at Malachor V, where she cut herself off from the Force, created an echo large enough that Kreia was able to connect the tragedy to the wound created in the Force. In Surik's disconnection, she saw an opportunity to liberate the galaxy from the Force's control over the fates of all living things. According to Kreia, those who had chosen death, or the Jedi who chose the dark side, over a life devoid of the Force were not strong enough to deserve life. Her desire to prevent the spiritual death of the individual in the future was the motivation that cultivated her hatred for the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite her loathing of the Force's influence over sentients, she still used it; she explained it by comparing herself to one who would use poison. Just as such a person would strive to understand the lethality behind poison, so she strived to understand the particularities of the Force, thereby enabling her to destroy it; however, she admitted it was possible that that may have really been just an excuse for her having to come to depend on something she hated. Kreia envisioned a galaxy that would choose not to acquiesce to the will of the Force. She thought she could achieve this by showing how one could willingly abnegate the Force and eventually become stronger for it, and it was Meetra Surik who was a living testament to this. In her teachings with Surik, she emphasized how dependent the Jedi and Sith were on the Force, and how they had become flawed for it. By making Surik her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, she hoped her message would resonate with future Force-sensitives so they would choose to use the Force without relying on it. Ultimately, though, she dreamed of a galaxy lacking of the Force altogether, as it was her belief that the galaxy would be better off without it imposing its will."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Kreia was intelligent and powerful, she realized that her philosophies would be regarded as fanatical by both the Jedi and the Sith. Hence, she preferred to operate from within the shadows, often using her own power to shield her identity from other Force-sensitives who might have known her, and could have otherwise detected her. She was not outspoken about her convictions, but simply stated her opinions as the correct way of thinking, although the exiled Sith did not enforce her own beliefs upon others.

She was known to have used an advanced Force technique known as Force Channel. Kreia was also a master of Dark Healing, which she used to kill dozens of Sith Assassins instantaneously and simultaneously on Malachor V. She was able to sever Jedi Masters' connection to the Force.

In her last moments, Kreia was also skilled at predicting the future and was able to foresee the death of Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett at the hands of Jedi Master Mace Windu approximately 4,000 years later, in a prophecy relating to the fate of the Mandalorians. She was also skilled in telepathy, being able to communicate with others over large distances. She demonstrated this when she telepathically spoke to Meetra Surik on Korriban. She telepathically informed Atris of Brianna's betrayal despite her being several light years away from Telos, while she was on the Ebon Hawk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kreia knew the ability of breath control, which made her immune to most gaseous poisons. She taught it to the Exile when she was in danger of dying from the toxic fumes of the Jekk'Jekk Tarr cantina during a meeting with local Exchange boss Visquis on Nar Shaddaa. Kreia also used her healing powers to revive the Wookiee Hanharr, after he was left for dead by Mira. On Onderon, she revived Colonel Tobin after he was killed by a drexl larva. Kreia was rather proficient at using the Force to hide her presence from whomever she chose. Her skill with this ability was demonstrated on the Ebon Hawk as she whispered to Mical, making him believe he was hearing things. Kreia also used a variation of this ability that enabled her to be seen but remain entirely unnoticed, to cloud the memory of others so they would forget her presence or even her existence. She was capable of modifying the memories of even Jedi; for instance, selectively modifying the memories of the Jedi Mical. When he discovered the true scale of Kreia's plans, she altered his memory to make him forget her completely. Kreia then modified his memory of what he had discovered; burying it so that he could remember what he had discovered about her plans at a time that suited her better. Kreia's skill with this technique was such that she could render herself completely invisible to Jedi, even ones that were in close proximity to her. When Surik asked Kreia why none of the Jedi Masters they encountered mentioned her, she lied to Surik, claiming that they perhaps did not remember or care. She described her ability as making herself \"very small\", a talent she claimed not to use on Surik, and that was even more effective on the worlds where they traveled, where sensing Force-users was difficult. On Dantooine, Jedi Master Vrook Lamar told Surik about the Sith threat, and told her of their ability to mask their presence, but he did not believe that mere Force-cloaking techniques alone would be sufficient to hide the one responsible for what had befallen the Jedi. Eventually, Surik would learn more about this; when Kreia was revealed as one of the Lords of the Sith in the past, Atris explained that much of the reason she succeeded in hiding her dark persona lay actually in the fact that the Force had been stripped from her. Kreia had extreme power over the workings of the mind and while she was a naturally talented manipulator, she could use the Force to confuse others, or reach into their minds and find their darkest secrets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kreia was skilled at telekinetic lightsaber combat, which allowed her to wield at least three lightsabers in combat, holding each of them aloft with the Force and having them fight with a will of their own.

During this time, Kreia searched and gathered relics of the dark side. On Korriban, Kreia indulged Surik in a tour of the tombs and excavation sites in the Valley of the Dark Lords while showing her a profound knowledge of their history, a contempt for ignorance, and a care for truth that survived to her last days. In her journey with Surik, Kreia spoke of healing during a lesson related to skills as something about which she was knowledgeable. When asked about her eyes, Kreia claimed to be able to heal her own damaged eyes\u2014which were atrophied from disuse\u2014yet she refused to do so, as she had the ability to see through the Force, and regarded her natural sight as a distraction.
