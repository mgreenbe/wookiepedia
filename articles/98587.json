Around three centuries before the Galactic Civil War, Nozho entered into a civil war with the city-state of Weogar. The conflict was short-lived, as both sides launched biological, chemical and mutagenic weapons against the other. These weapons shattered Bith's ecosystem and ultimately killed the majority of the world's population. This led to the world being quarantined and a dramatic shift in Bith culture."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nozho was first mentioned in the new Star Wars canon in Fully Operational, a 2018 roleplaying supplement produced by Fantasy Flight Games for the Star Wars: Age of Rebellion system.
