Soon after the Battle of Kothlis, Michka joined in a competition led by Master Taria Damsin and played on Damsin's Blue team. The competition, taking place in the new Sublevel Nineteen Training Dojo, ended in a tie. Michka was one of the three members of Blue team to make it all the way through the dojo to the mini city. Climbing up the final tower to the beacon that would end the race, she made a poor hand motion and fell off the tower. Master Damsin saved her by using the Force, but she barely caught her as she was talking to Ahsoka Tano."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
