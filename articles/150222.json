Said machine traveled in a shaft that extended vertically, allowing them to move up and down. In the case of a building, a turbolift could be either internal or external to the structure. Toward the end of the Clone Wars, the elevators installed in the Separatist dreadnoughts were cable-borne and equipped with braking mechanisms."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the planet Coruscant, turbolifts could be used to travel between the many levels of the ecumenopolis. A human girl named Anandra Milon and her younger brother Santigo Milon once used a turbolift to travel from Level 1997 to Level 1996, as did a stormtrooper who pursued them. For transit to and from Quarzite, the Belugan homeworld, an immense turbolift sped travelers to an orbital space station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
