Following such freelance success, Bosh moved to the galactic capital Coruscant to pursue government contracts from the Galactic Republic. This government work included producing the piece titled \"Strength and Unity\" based on a concept by Vice Chancellor Mas Amedda for a campaign meant to combat the human-dominated imagery of most Core Worlds government messaging and stir up patriotic unity amongst viewers. Due to the inclusion of Amedda's own likeness in the image, the piece was mostly remembered as a work of self-indulgence and ego by the Vice Chancellor, rather than a piece of unifying propaganda."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Angilar Bosh was created by Pablo Hidalgo for the reference book Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy, which was released on October 25, 2016."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
