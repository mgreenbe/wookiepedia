However, the freighter was still protected by a field of mines around it. Keyan Farlander in a Y-wing cleared them out and disabled the freighter. When that was done, the Herald came and boarded the freighter. Imperial transports came and attempted to destroy the freighter before it could fall into enemy hands, but Farlander was able to drive them off."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the help of abducted Cygnus Corp staff, the warhead was then delivered to the Invincible in a shuttle modified to appear to be an Imperial vessel, and the Star Destroyer was blown up from the inside."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
