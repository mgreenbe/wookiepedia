The opera premiered at Votrad Stadium on Brentaal on 38:2:13. After the successful performance, the show went on tour throughout the Core Worlds and the Colonies. During this tour, it debuted on Imperial Center in 3 ABY, where it was performed inside the Grand Convocation Chamber of the Senate Building. Its opening was attended by the Galactic elite, including Grand Admiral Miltin Takel and other high-profile socialites."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Controversy erupted in the media when it was found that Amaro Fonteen, a Human, would be playing the role of Banu Hydia, traditionally played by a Duros double-bass vocalist. The Brentaal Council on High Human Culture and the Brentaal Hall Conservatory both released statements that denounced the \"narrow-minded idea that a Duros role [could not] be voiced by a human.\" The council and the conservatory also both rejected the notion that certain arias in The Kallea Cycle were offensive in their portrayals of nonhumans and their philosophies, arguing that the Cycle was one of the highest achievements of Brentaal and Core culture. An addendum explaining these views was added to the program for the Cycle with assistance from the Arts Division of the COMPNOR Coalition for Progress."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characters"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Music"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Act I"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Act II"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Act III"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
