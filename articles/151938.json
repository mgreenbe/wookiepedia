It had masculine programming, and was a member of a group of three battle droids placed under the command of the astromech droid R2-D2 during a mission to the Outer Rim planet Lola Sayu. This droid and his subordinates flew the shuttle carrying a Republic strike team, the members of which had been carbon-frozen, onto the planet to rescue Jedi Master Even Piell from the Citadel prison. After the strike team infiltrated the prison, R2 had his droids land the shuttle at the prison's landing pad on orders from Anakin Skywalker. R2 and the droids disembarked from the shuttle and were met by the T-series military strategic analysis and tactics droid K2-B4, who suspected that the shuttle was not genuine. The battle droid quickly pretended that the astromech was his prisoner, and they infiltrated the prison. Onboard a turbolift, he apologized to R2, after the astromech had rolled into his leg. Upon making contact with the strike team, one half of which had been captured and subsequently escaped, the droids again posed as guards escorting their \"prisoners\" to the shuttle. They were ambushed and the shuttle was destroyed, and the droids joined the rest of the team in fleeing. After fleeing team is boxed in between sheer cliffs and a deep cavern, the droids sacrificed themselves to delay the pursuing Separatist forces. The lead droid told R2 that it had been an honor to serve under him, before the droids charged a LM-432 crab droid and were destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
