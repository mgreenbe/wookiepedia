After the outbreak of the war at the First Battle of Geonosis, CC-2237, due to his status as a Clone Commander, was given additional training in the flight academy on Coruscant, despite his Kaminoan training under their clone trooper pilot program. There, CC-2237 learned tricks and tactics, and passed them on to the pilots under his command in Clone Flight Squad Seven. This significantly improved their effectiveness."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
