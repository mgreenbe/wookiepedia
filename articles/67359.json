Larger types could even disable a large capital ship, such as the Mega-ion cannons that were mounted on the side of the Subjugator-class heavy cruiser Malevolence, or the v-150 planetary ion cannon used by the Alliance to Restore the Republic. During the Battle of Scrim Island, continued fire from several planetary ion cannons dealt a considerable amount of damage to the hull of at least one Arquitens-class light cruiser."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor featured ion cannons that shot bursts of plasma that would cause temporary electrical disruptions to a target upon impact."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Y-wing starfighters were also equipped with ion cannons, most notably those used by the Alliance's Gold Squadron. Though their field of fire was somewhat limited, the ion cannons were quite powerful, with three blasts being sufficient to disable an Arquitens-class command cruiser and only one to completely disable a TIE/d \"Defender\" Multi-Role Starfighter starfighter. This was demonstrated during a skirmish in the Archeon Nebula."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Early in the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems equipped the massive Subjugator-class heavy cruiser, the Malevolence, with immense ion cannons.
