Embroiled in a terrible, centuries-long war, the planet's natives were nearly driven to extinction by a species known as the Lontars. Intervening in the conflict, the Galactic Senate demanded a cessation of violence on the world and Batorine formally joined the ancient institution in 110 BBY. A world of artisans and assassins, Batorine's population remained less then one million sentients long after the conflict ended; many Blood Carvers relocated to secret enclaves on the Republic capital world, Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
