Important woods included greel wood, harvested from the greel trees of Pii III and Pii IV; wroshyr-wood, obtained from the giant wroshyr trees of the planet Kashyyyk; and Alderaanian rainbow wood, a commodity made scarce following the destruction of the planet Alderaan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wood had a number of uses. The Ewoks of Endor used lightweight sacred wood in the construction of skin gliders In some uses, it was seen as a luxury, including as interior paneling on luxury speeders like the Ubrikkian LuxurPort Zisparanza, which was paneled with Alderaanian rainbow-wood until its scarcity forced the manufacturers to switch to scarlet-hued greel wood."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Those who harvested wood from trees professionally were known as loggers. A group of alien loggers came to Endor to harvest wood from the forest moon's many Soul Trees, sacred to the native Ewoks; but their operation was thwarted by the young Ewoks Wicket and Princess Kneesa, and the young Foonar Dooni."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
