The walker's design was rare among other designs, built long and low-to-ground, it was equipped with four short legs that were able to extend from the sides of the walker's hull rather than straight down in comparison to the much larger All Terrain Armored Transport or All Terrain Scout Transport, which gave it a lizard-like, rather than mammal-like, gait and appearance. It was operated by a crew of three\u2014pilot, gunner, and commander\u2014housed in a cramped, forward-mounted control pod. The rest of the vehicle was given over to its power, drive, and fire-control systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Heavily armored for a walker of its size, the AT-AA was a slow, plodding vehicle that was better suited to rear echelon, over-the-horizon artillery support and air-defense than front line combat. The AT-AA was armed with either a turret-mounted twin light flak cannon or a turret-mounted concussion missile launcher. Its armament, when combined with the walker's sophisticated air-defense targeting system, allowed squads of AT-AAs to deny remarkably broad swath of sky to enemy airspeeders and starships, and while they were capable of keeping entire squadrons at bay with flak bursts and concussion missiles, the walker lacked secondary armament and thus were woefully susceptible to attack from ground assault. Despite being equipped with firing ports from which the crew could fire their personal weapons, the vehicle had minimal defenses against a determined ground-based enemy, and as a result, the AT-AA was often paired with infantry and AT-ST support."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The All Terrain Anti Aircraft served as an air-defense walker, targeting aircraft in the vicinity.
