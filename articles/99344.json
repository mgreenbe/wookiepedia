The troops defending the garrison gained months of experience from holding off the moon's sea creatures. In 3 ABY, the Rebel Alliance's 61st Mobile Infantry was deployed to Obumubo with the intention of obliterating the Imperial garrison in order to create a job vacancy that an individual posted at the planet Kuat could then be promoted to. The Obumubo garrison initially had the advantage over the battlefield due to their combat experience. After two days of fighting, however, the 61st were able to erect siege weapons, which brought the garrison down."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial garrison appeared in Alexander Freed's 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
