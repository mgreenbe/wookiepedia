One of the world's twenty-eight moons, it had a rocky surface on which the forces of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire had established an ion cannon by the year 137 ABY. In that year, Krayt's Coruscant Third Fleet was attacked over Ralltiir by the fleets of the Empire-in-exile and Galactic Alliance Remnant, a battle which saw Gahan and Andurgo, both pilots of the legendary Rogue Squadron, destroy the moon's ion cannon before it could be protected by a force field."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "References"}]}
