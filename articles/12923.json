Staffed by a Human bartender, the tavern was a stomping ground for city residents in need of a refreshment. From the outside, the building appeared as a gray, mostly featureless structure, with three horizontal grooves and a rectangular window above a rectangular door. The door's lining was bronze in color and had several glyphs carved into it. The tavern was actually part of a building block that also included a set of apartments and the House of Max. The upper levels of the apartments could be reached via a staircase that led to a balcony patio built atop the tavern."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tavern's interior was spartan, containing no furniture other than a wooden bar that extended from one wall and stopped short of the opposite wall. Behind the bar was an alcove with a decorative pattern that carried three personal shield charges. The walls were stone-gray, and the floor was tiled. The ceiling was also gray and had support beams that ran the length of the cantina."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tavern had been built by the year 5 ABY, when Barons Hed had become a haven for bounty hunters in the employ of the Galactic Empire. At one point, five Gran bounty hunters entered the tavern for drinks. When one of them, Shmorg, offered to pay the bill, another Gran offered to buy the drinks instead. An argument erupted, and the Gran started a violent brawl. As it broke out, the bartender tried to dissuade the use of blasters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After two of the Gran were killed in the confrontation, the brawl was put to an end by Kyle Katarn, a New Republic Jedi trainee, who killed all of the remaining Gran when they tried to attack him.
