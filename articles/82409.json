Around 34 ABY, Lita went on a mission with the crew and traveled with them to the Outer Rim planet Actlyon afterward. During the mission, and while on Actlyon, Lita shared java cakes with her colleagues Damar Olin and Izal Garsea.

The crew enjoyed orders of refreshments at the cantina but soon rushed to escape as bounty hunters raided it.

Jeet accepted the task for a fee of 1,000 credits and proceeded to track the pair to the ancient ruins at the edge of Black Spire Outpost. Tolla's crew, including Lita, apprehended Rakab with the intention of using him to help destroy Kat Saka's farm and allowed Jeet to seize Garsea as insurance that he would comply. However, Jeet later failed to deliver her to the crew after being convinced by Garsea that Tolla and Lita's earlier veneer of inclusion into their operation was a facade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following their arrival at the farm, per Tolla's orders, Lita provided Rakab with a pair of loose green pants to replace the garments he had been forced to leave behind at the ruins. After Rakab assisted Tolla in accessing the farm's seed storehouse, Lita helped the crew's second-in-command, the human-Twi'lek hybrid Safwan, with lifting crates onto the crew's ship. Their colleague Damar Olin was assigned to watch over Rakab as the farmer assisted Lita and Safwan with their assigned tasks.

Though willing to follow Ana Tolla's orders in abducting Julen Rakab, she treated him relatively cordially compared to the rest of her crew. Lita often carried sweets with her on missions to share with her crewmates, which they enjoyed immensely. However, after being abandoned by Tolla's crew, Izal Garsea reflected that the Ketzalian's generosity may have been a pretense to court favor. Although Lita shared a workable affinity with the crew's second-in-command, Safwan, she quickly became annoyed with her colleague Damar Olin's antagonizing of Julen Rakab. Lita was willing to leave Tolla, Oksan, and Olin behind to escape Kat Saka's farm with Safwan when their mission on Batuu failed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lita was a Ketzalian female who had thick purple wings, which outwardly appeared filmy.

She spoke Basic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Skills and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lita's wings gave her the capability to fly, which was a skill she used to glide above the wall surrounding Saka's farm during her crew's mission on Batuu."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lita appeared in A Crash of Fate, a 2019 young-adult novel written by Zoraida C\u00f3rdova. C\u00f3rdova had originally intended for Lita to be a bird-like species already in existence within the Star Wars universe. However, that species' appearance in the then-upcoming themed attraction Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge led Walt Disney Imagineering and Lucasfilm to decide that the presented overlap between it and A Crash of Fate could potentially prove confusing to park visitors. C\u00f3rdova was permitted to create a new species specifically catering to the story's needs for Lita, which the author eventually called Ketzalians."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "C\u00f3rdova felt Lita's endearing demeanor helped her fit within the dynamic of Ana Tolla's crew, while still possessing unusual qualities.
