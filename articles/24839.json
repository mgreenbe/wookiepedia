Around 22 BBY, the Human Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi was sent to Ord Cestus to prevent the sale of the Force-sensitive JK-13 security droids, which posed a significant threat to the Jedi Order. Upon his arrival in Ord Cestus's capital, ChikatLik, a band of musician droids greeted the Knight's party with renditions of the Cestian anthem and \"All Stars Burn as One\", the official anthem of the Republic. For Kenobi, the Cestian anthem sounded like a medley of melodic bleeps and hoots."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The anthem first appeared in the 2004 novel The Cestus Deception, which was written by Steven Barnes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
