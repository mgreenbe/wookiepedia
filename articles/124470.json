The ship was deployed during a battle fought on the moon Gall, where it shielded the Separatist Droid Army invading the moon. Gall's planetary defense force attempted to shoot down the Separatist landing craft but could not penetrate the shield produced by the lead craft, although the Separatists could shoot out from within it at the defenders. A sergeant serving in the defense force informed Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Padawan Ahsoka Tano of the shielding and the pair used agricultural vehicles known as jet-wings to fly through the lead craft's shielding without being detected by its sensors. Skywalker and Tano landed successfully on the craft and entered through a hatch on its exterior. They then made their way through several rooms filled with inactive B1-Series battle droids before reaching the shield generator, which they commented looked similar to technology designed by Geonosians, although far more advanced. They then planted explosives on the generator, triggering the activation of the droid forces onboard. The pair fought against the attacking B1 battle droids and B2 super battle droids, but were far outnumbered and used their lightsabers to carve through the flooring of the ship and drop to safety in their Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor which were waiting below. The explosives then detonated, destroying the ship and lowering the shields covering the rest of the landing craft and allowing the defense force to destroy them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The shielded craft first appeared, but wasn't named, in Inside Job a comic written by Rik Hoskin and illustrated by Andres Ponce, which was published in 2009 in issue 6.1 of the Star Wars Comic UK magazine series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
