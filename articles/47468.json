The tell-tale signs of their alien lineage was their short fur and long tail, sharp, fang-like teeth, along with a hyperdeveloped sense of balance, perfect night vision, and hyper-fast reflexes and speed\u2014all results of their feline evolution. Their tails can also retract into their bodies when they are in danger. Their tails are hyper-sensitive and can detect subtle atmospheric differences. However, when a Felacatian was forced to stand hyperspace for an extended period of time, or when they experienced any level of stress, a Felacatian's body began to change. Without an outlet for their stress, the Felacatian's body would shift its form within seconds, becoming a huge, predatory cat. In this form, the Felacatian was extremely dangerous, and was protected by a row of heavy spikes along their back, along with claws that could shred durasteel, notoriously potent strength and speed, and incredible sensory perception. With practice, a Felacatian could phase back and forth in between the two forms at will, and, with further practice, restrain themselves from shifting when they did not want to."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
