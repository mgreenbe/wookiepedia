Around 3643 BBY, it was occupied by Jedi Grand Master Satele Shan. It was noted as having a golden appearance, rather than the typical red-and-gray or orange-and-gray color scheme of Republic warships. The Corellia was struck by a missile during Independent Operation Sebaddon and boarded by Fastbreeders. The droids overwhelmed and commandeered the ship, destroying it in order to spread themselves throughout the rest of the Republic fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
