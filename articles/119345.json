The Star of Iskin was destroyed to cover her tracks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tasha kept in contact with Bulq and his Separatist clique after the Valorum job.

But as she always researched people, Tasha rightly suspected that Quinlan Vos, Hentz's constant companion, was behind the request. Vos had come seeking information about the Valorum job and her connection with Senator Viento. Vos drew her into a heated confrontation to reveal what she knew, she promised to \"relieve\" him of the pain he caused and eventually he managed to draw the memories of her with his psychometric abilities, leading him to believe Sora Bulq was the \"Second Sith\", Darth Sidious. Since he knew the identity of her other employer, Tasha prepared to make him \"one of the Silent Voices, forever\". But before she could drink his soup, Khaleen struck her with a metal pole and aimed a blaster at her. Tasha fled the scene, having also lost her gauntlets in the process. She vowed vengeance on Quinlan and Khaleen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Dark Horse release of Trackdown, Dexter Jettster calls her Saj\u00e9 Tasha, but when she grabs Khaleen Hentz, she calls herself Salj\u00e9 Tasha.
