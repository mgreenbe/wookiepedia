Following the Battle of Asylum he travelled to Odessen and joined the Alliance against the Eternal Empire of Zakuul. Miot was arranging to smuggle weapons to local resistance cell on Bothawui, when the entire cell was vaporized by the Bothawui Star Fortress above. This prompted Theron Shan and the Alliance Commander to take action against Arcann's Star Fortresses. Miot piloted the shuttle with the two of them to one of the battle stations, where the Commander infiltrated the Star Fortress and gathered information about its inner workings, while Theron provided remote assistance from the shuttle. The Commander was forced to retreat after defeating the EPHEMERIS and set out to secure local allies on the world terrorized by the Star Fortresses. Eventually, the planetary shield bunkers that provided shielding to several of the Star Fortresses were destroyed and Theron and the Commander attempted the mission again, with Miot once more acting as a pilot. The Commander was able to overload the Sun Generator, destroying the entire Star Fortress, and later using the same method to liberate the worlds of Alderaan, Belsavis, Hoth, Nar Shaddaa, Tatooine and Voss."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Miot Dengd appears in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire during the Star Fortess series of missions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
