Around 1 ABY, shortly after the Rebel Alliance began a campaign into the Mid Rim, Khemt and a Moff named Coovern died. The pair's deaths were officially reported to have been tragic accidents; however, sources informed Imperial Governor Everi Chalis that the Sith Lord Darth Vader had been responsible for both deaths. Vader had supposedly killed Khemt and Coovern on orders from Emperor Palpatine, who, after the loss of the Death Star superweapon, wanted those he considered incompetent among the Empire's elite culled. Chalis later defected to the Alliance in 3 ABY, and revealed the true nature of Khemt and Coovern's deaths to the leader of the Alliance's 61st Mobile Infantry, Captain Micha Evon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Khemt was mentioned in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
