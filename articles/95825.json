It had a human bartender and the waitresses, including a Gamorrean one, wore \"spacesuit\" costumes with transparent arms and legs. It was clean and the drinks were relatively cheap. It had a large fishtank inside it, that ran from the floor to the ceiling and contained amphibians."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Heroes of Cularin once went there in search of Berpo, a Toydarian criminal who was drinking there, with a female Rodian and a female Twi'lek. Berpo felt threatened by the heroes, so he put a vibrodagger to the Twi'lek's throat and threatened to kill her if they came close to him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
