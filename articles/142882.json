In its heyday, the Concourse was a multi-level structure that was filled with stores and services aimed towards visiting spacers. The main level was the site of a large garden. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, the Concourse had fallen into disrepair. Many levels of the Concourse had been shut down and cannibalized for spare parts, with some sections open to space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Visitors to Darknon Station could use the Concourse to access the Trade House, Chapter House, Stormview Lounge, Van Serai Hotel, Galaxy Shop, and the Darknon Station Repair Bay."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
