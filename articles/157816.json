Galactic Republic Supreme Chancellor Tarsus Valorum proposed the Unification Policies to help reunite the star systems that had started to show the seeds of rebellion after the war; he wanted to bring those worlds back into the web of Republic influence. Valorum proposed the Unification Policies as part of his Ruusan Reformation, a series of proposed reforms that were meant to restructure the whole Republic. After the policies were enacted, the Galactic Senate was able to enforce the regulations of membership in the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Unification Policies were first proposed following the New Sith Wars, which ended with the final battle of Ruusan in 1000 BBY. Because several separatist groups, such as the Anti-Republic Liberation Front, saw the Unification Policies as a form of bullying, nearly one hundred small rebellions arose following the policies' approval. Darth Bane, the last remaining Dark Lord of the Sith, worked behind the scenes to pit rebellious organizations against the Republic, hoping to distract the Republic from the secret survival of the Sith Order. One such event happened in 990 BBY on the planet Serenno, where Bane's apprentice, Darth Zannah, worked to get a small Anti-Republic Liberation Front cell to perform a kidnapping of Valorum, by then the former Supreme Chancellor. One member of the cell, a man by the name of Paak, was originally against the idea, but his hatred of the Unification Policies was so great he eventually went along with the plan to kidnap Valorum. The members of the cell attempted to kidnap the former Chancellor but were stopped by Jedi Knight Johun Othone. Over the years, several separatist cells tried to oppose the government's ability to keep star systems in the Republic, but their efforts were in vain. The Republic stood for almost another thousand years, and many of the rebellious groups eventually disappeared."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Unification Policies were first mentioned in Darth Bane: Rule of Two, published on December 26, 2007.
