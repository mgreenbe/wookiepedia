It was part of early rebel movement, headed in secret by Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan, that would become the Alliance to Restore the Republic. After an attack by the Imperial officer Viggen, Ryden and his men were forced to flee and relocate to Kinrah. At one point, Ryden realized that his cell was a little short-staffed, and he asked Commander Jun Sato of Phoenix Cell if he could spare one or two men. Sato then dispatched Reann Tomvig and Mizel Pomdak to Kinrah, though only the latter ended up joining Ryden's cell. Linslo was also part of the cell."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
