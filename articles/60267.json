The Resistance Doctor Harter Kalonia kept a handheld healing field generator as part of her field kit while she was stationed in the Resistance base on the planet D'Qar, keeping it in its own cushioned case. Around thirty years after the Battle of Endor, she used the generator to treat the Wookiee Chewbacca after he was brought to the base after having fought with the Resistance against the First Order on the planet Takodana. Chewbacca could not feel the device, but felt all his lingering pain vanish as his wounds were erased."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A healing field generator first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in 2015.
