Gems were considered to be extremely valuable, such as the fire rubies on Lothal, an Outer Rim planet. Another type of gem was the Corusca gem, a purple-hued gem used as a form of currency. Some artworks contained gemstones, and they were sold at black markets or other vendors such as Otor's Hub. Certain gemstones that had little to no value on certain planets or to certain species could be of great value to others. In the time when much of the galaxy was still ruled by the Sith, trade in gemstones was much less regulated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
