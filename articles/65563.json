A reorganized command structure, eventually consisting of twelve Grand Admirals, oversaw the rapid expansion of the fleet that had begun during the Clone Wars. Growing discontent with the Empire eventually coalesced into the Alliance to Restore the Republic, which began a military campaign against Imperial forces, that became known as the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, the Empire began to devolve into warlordism and infighting, splintering the Imperial Navy. Though the Navy would fight on under a succession of leaders, including Ysanne Isard, Grand Admiral Thrawn, the Reborn Emperor, and Admiral Daala, it would not again become a cohesive unit until the establishment of the Imperial Remnant under Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon, becoming a veritable fighting force once again under his command during the Yuuzhan Vong War. The Imperial Navy would regain much of its former strength by the time of the Fel Empire, under which it fought the Galactic Alliance in the Sith\u2013Imperial War. The Navy would be split into those loyal to Roan Fel and those who served Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire in the subsequent civil war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Navy was one of the most formidable militaries ever assembled, consisting of millions of warships, fighters and transports, manned by trillions of fleet crew. The mainstays of its fleets - the Star Destroyer and Super Star Destroyer capital ships and the TIE fighter series of starfighters - became some of the most visible symbols of Imperial rule to the galaxy's civilian populace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The role of the Imperial Navy was the absolute dominance of known space in the name of the Empire, as well as enforcing the Emperor's will. Admiral Conan Antonio Motti identified four key functions of the Imperial Navy, including blockading spaceports to cripple a planet's ability to fight, bombarding planets to destroy enemy infrastructure, guarding shipping lanes against pirates and smugglers to safeguard commerce as well as frighten criminals into conducing honest trade, and transporting and supporting other branches of the Imperial Military from space and from the air, supplying them with space and aerial support upon disembarkation if necessary. In large part because of the requirement of traveling throughout the galaxy in the Navy, a tour of duty for naval officers often resulted in them encountering various unique peoples and visiting various exotic worlds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition, the Imperial Navy was also charged with freeing the system space of member worlds from hazards to profitable commerce, assure the safety of member worlds from attack from outside forces, and bolster the planetary governments in times of crisis, which was one of the few instances where the Navy was unchanged in role from that of the Old Republic. However, a major difference was that, regarding the bolstering of planetary governments during crises, the Imperial Navy under the New Order could do so pre-emptively without waiting for a majority vote in the Senate, while the Republic Navy in turn needed to wait at least a week composed of seven days for conflicts to resolve before, upon getting a majority vote, interfering. In addition, ever since the Dissolution of the Imperial Senate, the Navy, largely due to no longer being required to wait for a vote from the Senate, often got civilian orders transmitted at the level of the Sector Group, with the orders coming from regional Moffs, Grand Moffs, or even the Emperor himself, and likewise smaller units only were to receive orders from officers in the proper chain of command. This was a change from the Republic Navy in the sense that originally, Senators or other politically powerful beings could directly commandeer naval vessels \u2013 or in some cases entire squadrons \u2013 without needing to have the order come down through the chain of command. In addition, the Imperial Navy was required to work alongside the Imperial Army in a support role during critical phases of various military operations and even to some extent supply some of its assets to permanent Army outposts. This was a contrast to the Republic Navy, which generally was the military branch pre-Clone Wars that was paid for by the Republic as a whole and was stretched too thin to play any role in the barely existent Republic Army during combat operations and at best ferried them between destinations, with the Republic Navy's expenditures remaining stable while the Republic Army's expenditures decreasing due to complaints by non-wealthy member worlds due to excessive costs at maintaining them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Navy's doctrine was heavily influenced by the experience of the Clone Wars, and emphasized maximizing capital ship firepower rather than achieving starfighter superiority, and it subordinated its starfighters to this role. The Navy's earliest Star Destroyer design, the Venator-class, had carried a substantial complement of 420 starfighters to counter the swarms of droid starfighters deployed by the Confederate Navy and had proved its worth as both a fighting ship and a carrier, but many Imperial strategists came to think that it would have been more effective if designed for a single role. Subsequent Star Destroyer designs like the hangarless Tector-class were larger and were built around more powerful reactors, allowing them to carry heavier defenses and weapons and so lessen the effectiveness of starfighter attacks. After a period of experimentation, the Navy settled on the Imperial-class Star Destroyer as the backbone of the Fleet. It was heavily optimized for fleet combat, carrying only a single wing of 72 starfighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Clone Wars had demonstrated the effectiveness of hyperspace-capable snubfighters - heavily-armed starfighters capable of both dogfighting and dealing damage to capital ships - as battleship killers. However, seeing it as a distasteful legacy of the hordes of Vulture-class droid starfighters deployed by the Separatists, the Imperial Navy abandoned the development of snubfighters in favor of more the more traditional combination of dedicated space superiority fighters and bombers: the TIE Series, which exemplified traditional starfighter doctrine with the TIE/LN starfighter and the TIE/sa Bomber, was a series of barebones fighter designs built around a ball-shaped cockpit and the revolutionary twin ion engine design. Seen as complements to Star Destroyers, they served as escorts, scouts, hit-and-fade raiders, and bombers supporting ground troops. As such, they lacked hyperdrives, deflector shields, or even life support systems, reducing their mass and giving them great speed and maneuverability, but also limiting their survivability and their range."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The New Order"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Navy was formed from the Republic Navy of the Old Republic. After Supreme Chancellor Palpatine declared himself Emperor in 19 BBY, establishing the first Galactic Empire, he began a campaign of Imperialization, under which the Republic Navy, now containing the Planetary Security Forces of individual member worlds, was renamed the Imperial Navy. Palpatine's first purge of the Imperial Navy occurred within two weeks into the Empire's rule. A rapid expansion of the number of Naval ships begun near the end of the Clone Wars was further increased. In addition, Palpatine also let the Empire have a massive buildup despite the end of the Clone Wars. As such, citizens of many planets were very eager to join the then-newly formed Imperial Navy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Reconquest of the Rim, starting in 19 BBY, the bulk of the Imperial fleet was still composed of Victory-class and Venator-class Star Destroyers, with their fighter squadrons being composed of V-wings and ARC-170s.

Through campaigns like the Ciutric Offensive, the Sy Myrthian Insurrection, the Five Veils Campaign, the Listehol Campaign, the Noolian Crisis, and the Western Reaches Operation, Naval officers like Terrinald Screed, Wilhuff Tarkin, Wullf Yularen, and Octavian Grant, as well as starfighter aces like Shea Hublin, became heroes to the Imperial populace. At the height of the Empire, in large part because of its reputation of upholding law and order in the known galaxy, Naval officers were often held with respect and admiration, as well as having millions of personnel in service."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Empire's aggressive militarization continued throughout the Imperial Period. Of the entire Imperial Military, the Navy benefited the most, ultimately swelling to a strength of 25,000 Imperial-class Star Destroyers and millions more smaller warships and support vessels by the time of the Battle of Yavin. The numerical size of the Imperial Navy as well as its firepower capabilities were such that even Mon Mothma, one of the leaders of the Rebel Alliance, acknowledged that what ground the Alliance held mattered little if it could not win the clash of navies. However, it was later remarked by Alliance strategists like General Carlist Rieekan that the Imperial Navy grew far too fast, resulting in a force that was top-heavy with war machines that it could not effectively crew or repair."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The continued growth of the Imperial Navy despite the absence of a clear and present danger to the Empire was a factor in the Declaration of Rebellion in 2 BBY. Additionally, a philosophical divide emerged in the Imperial Navy between the \"Generationals\" - those officers whose families had done military service for centuries - and new up-and-coming officers who tended to be New Order partisans. The Generationals saw the Empire as an improvement on the ideals of the Republic and saw the Navy as a tool for establishing stability and order, and so peace. The true believers of the New Order, however, saw the Old Republic as decrepit and sought to rule by fear, best represented by the policy of state terror set out in the Tarkin Doctrine. The increasingly-brutal and arbitrary operations conducted against dissent by the Imperial Navy such as the Nembus Sector campaign and the Kwymar Suppressions led many Generational officers to become disillusioned with the Empire."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Civil War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Growing discontent with the Empire eventually coalesced into the Alliance to Restore the Republic, which began a military campaign against Imperial forces.

Although the Alliance Fleet was not as large or as powerful as the well-trained Imperial Navy, the two fleets would battle each other regularly throughout the Galactic Civil War. An early humiliation was dealt to the Imperial Navy by the Alliance at the Battle of Turkana, and thereafter the Navy faced a serious challenge to its established doctrine: since it lacked large numbers of capital ships, the Rebel Alliance made heavy use of snubfighters as part of its stateless strategy. Powerful starfighters like the BTL-S3 Y-Wing and T-65 X-wing conducted hit-and-hype raids against prominent Imperial targets and supply convoys, using their superior shielding, armament, and hyperdrives to inflict disproportionate damage on Imperial targets. Meanwhile, the Alliance Fleet roamed the galaxy, challenging Imperial authority merely by existing, and waiting for the chance of a decisive battle with the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Galactic Empire made belated moves to develop their own snubfighters like the TIE Advanced x1 and the TIE/D Defender after the Rebels inflicted humiliating defeats on them with X-wings, but the most numerous new development was the TIE/IN, a non-hyperspace capable traditional interceptor that though capable of outracing Rebel fighters, was not equipped with deflector shields. The Navy was present at both Death Stars and suffered massive losses as a result of the Alliance's destruction of the stations at the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, and the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The command structure of the entire Navy was reorganized around 2 BBY with Emperor Palpatine's appointment of the twelve Grand Admirals, the most senior officers of the whole Starfleet. Widely seen as an attempt by the Emperor to increase his power over the Fleet, Imperial officers swapped numerous conspiracy theories as to the method behind his appointments. The truth of the appointments was that, though all the Grand Admirals were exceptionally gifted officers, they were not just front-line commanders; rather, they included several technical specialists and theoreticians, enabling them to serve as a leadership cadre for the whole Imperial Military \u2014 and indeed the whole Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though the First Death Star was technically a Navy battlestation, many traditionalists and Generationals in the Navy were horrified by the idea of presenting an existential threat to terrorize planets into submission. In addition, the Death Star threatened to eliminate the Navy's prestige as the greatest expression of Imperial power. After the Death Star was destroyed at Yavin and Wilhuff Tarkin was killed, the Navy championed the Sarlacc Project and the creation of a new class of massive Star Dreadnoughts, which became the Empire's mightiest warships. Designed to be so powerful that the mere threat of their deployment would pacify multiple sectors, the first class was the 19,000-meter Executor-class Star Dreadnought, led by the flagship of Lord Darth Vader, the Executor. Death Squadron, a new Star Destroyer fleet led by Darth Vader, Kendal Ozzel and Firmus Piett aboard the Executor, dealt the Rebel Alliance a shattering defeat at the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY. The Executor's example led to the development of the even more massive, superlaser-equipped Sovereign- and Eclipse-class dreadnoughts, which were intended to revolutionize space warfare and ensure Imperial dominance of space for a century."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A few months before the Battle of Endor, one of the Grand Admirals, Demetrius Zaarin, attempted a coup against Emperor Palpatine, which was put down by forces led by Lord Darth Vader and the mysterious Chiss Vice Admiral Mitth'raw'nuruodo, better known by his core name, Thrawn. After Zaarin's death, Thrawn was officially promoted to Grand Admiral as his replacement (although other evidence suggests that the Chiss had, in fact, been promoted in secret at an earlier stage).

The plot was a disaster, however. With the assistance of the native Ewoks of Endor, General Han Solo destroyed the planetary shield generator protecting the Death Star and General Lando Calrissian and Admiral Gial Ackbar destroyed the Death Star and much of Death Squadron. Darth Vader, Emperor Palpatine and Admiral Piett were killed in the battle, and many of the Empire's most promising young officers died in the destruction of the Executor, which would cripple the Navy's leadership in the years that followed.

The Imperial Navy's ability to fight was further reduced by the Alliance of Free Planets' Defense Declarations, which proclaimed the Alliance's intent to devolve control of the Planetary Security Forces, nationalized into the Navy's Sector Groups by the Empire, back to the sectors. Loyal Imperial Sector Groups dismissed the measure as illegal, but for others the Declarations caused many sectors that had been on the edge to side with the New Republic.

Thereafter, the personal ambition of warlords caused the Imperial Navy's strength to collapse further, particularly after the Loyalist Admiral Teren Rogriss de facto allied with the New Republic to destroy both Warlord Zsinj and Treuten Teradoc, who had been raiding both Imperial and New Republic targets.

Much of the unified Navy's strength was lost in the subsequent Imperial Civil War, however, laying much of Coruscant to waste and spreading across much of the recaptured galaxy.

An attempt to take advantage of the New Republic's apparent disarray after the Black Fleet Crisis in 17 ABY was an utter disaster for the Imperial Navy: Pellaeon managed to take Adumar and won surprise attacks on Taris and Champala on the Hydian Way, pushing all the way to the edge of the Core Worlds, but after Admiral Ackbar and General Garm Bel Iblis brought the full weight of the New Republic Defense Force to bear, the Second Battle of Champala became an Imperial rout. The Imperial Navy was chased back to Imperial Space, which was rapidly reduced after defeats at Ketaris and Tangrene, and the Battle of Anx Minor was a disaster, with the Megador and Dominion suffering severe damage. Pellaeon ordered an immediate retreat to Bastion. In mere weeks the Imperial Remnant had been reduced to a rump of eight Outer Rim sectors, and a navy that had numbered in the millions was reduced to mere thousands, with just two hundred Star Destroyers remaining.

The Sector Groups were split into multiple fleets of around 400 ships each led by Fleet Admirals, with the Group's combat elements being split between \"Superiority\" and \"Escort\". A superiority fleet was a space-combat force spearheaded by six Star Destroyers, each nominally accompanied by a battle squadron of eighteen smaller ships. While superiority fleets were officially assigned to fleet combat, in practice they were normally used as mobile reserves, projecting Imperial power in response to local threats. Escort fleets, meanwhile, were composed of force escorts and were designated for combat against pirates and raiders, which in practice meant that they were the Empire's first line of defense, protecting civilian freighters, attacking corsairs' hideouts, and guarding remote outposts. Additional fleet commands were established for the Sector Group's logistics and support forces, including troop transport, bombardment, deepdock and support fleets.

In practice, Star Destroyers were normally accompanied by just two or three escorts, if any: the Imperial-class was designed to operate without support, and its hyperdrive was too fast for any escorts except for the speediest light cruisers.

The Imperial Starfleet shaped four to twenty starships into lines, depending on type. The line was the most amorphous level of organization in the Starfleet. The Imperial Starfleet Order of Battle outlined seven types of lines: attack, heavy attack, reconnaissance, pursuit, skirmish, troop and torpedo. In addition to the seven types of lines, the Imperial Navy considered an Imperial-class Star Destroyer a line in itself.
