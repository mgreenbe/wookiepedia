The droid had an experimental emotional programming that was supposed to enhance the cohesive action of units in battle and so when his droid comrade R-5TM was damaged it, B-6NX tried to help him instead of focusing on the mission. B-6NX asked a passing Imperial hero to retrieve necessary parts to fix R-5TM, while the droid itself refused help and insisted that B-6NX's compassion was a threat to the mission and had to be removed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
