Two such ships were part of a Republic rescue fleet sent to assist Trymant IV in the wake of an Emergence following the Great Hyperspace Disaster. The Emergence, however, coincided with a Nihil attack on the planet, and one frigate became part of a blockade hastily set up to prevent the escape of a Nihil Spider Cruiser. Eye of the Nihil Marchion Ro had the cruiser fire upon the medical frigate as a distraction for its escort of Jedi Vectors, allowing the pirate ship to escape into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The medical frigate was introduced in The High Republic Adventures 2.
