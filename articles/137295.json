The Supreme Overlord often assumed power through the murder of the current Overlord. The Overlords wore ceremonial robes made from the flayed and preserved flesh of Steng, the first Warmaster, and Yo'gand, the first Supreme Overlord, who battled each other in the Cremlevian War which united the Yuuzhan Vong. On their ascension, the Supreme Overlord was ritually scarred and modified, sacrificing several external organs and limbs to make him resemble Yun-Yuuzhan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Politically, the Overlord held authority and power as Head of State/Government (Intendant caste), Commander-in-Chief (Warrior caste), and supreme religious leader (Priest caste), standing higher than the High Prefect, Warmaster, and High Priest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shimrra Jamaane was thought to be the final Supreme Overlord\u2014it was he who instigated the invasion of the galaxy a millennium after the Yuuzhan Vong left their primordial homeworld in ruins to seek out a new home.
