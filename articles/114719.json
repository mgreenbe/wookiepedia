In 34 ABY, many Resistance pilots joked that if Poe Dameron, their best pilot, would pose for a poster, Resistance recruitment would improve. Inspired by the joke, Ziff created a poster which depicted Dameron standing gallantly against a \"clear sky full of promises,\" accompanied by the X-wing starfighters under his command. Ziff titled the piece Resistance, adding the Resistance's signature starbird and the caption \"watching over the skies and stars.\" Although Ziff intended the poster to be a prank, the piece found its way to the HoloNet, where it sparked interest from future recruits. Following the poster's unintentional success, Ziff was selected by Resistance General Leia Organa to create The Massacre at Tuanul, a visualization of the First Order's attack on Tuanul."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Resistance was first mentioned in Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy, a canon reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and published on October 25, 2016."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
