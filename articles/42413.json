It cost around fifty credits and had a dual filter/feed function. It was used by members of the Alliance Special Forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mask had two modes of operation. The first mode, filter, used an Oxidizer filter to scrub the air of toxins, which allowed for up to an hour of breathability in toxic atmospheres. The second mode, feed, supplied a continuous supply of breathable air (or other types of gases at the users discretion) by way of a small atmosphere cylinder. Replacement filters and canisters were cheap and easily replaceable, with a wide variety of gasses being available."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
