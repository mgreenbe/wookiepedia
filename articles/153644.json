The Kilmaulsi was associated with a member of the reptilian Chistori species who was also on the planet and accompanied it to accept a job being offered by the Human Ember Chankeli from the planet Telerath. Chankeli wanted a gang of slavers removed from her hometown and had advertised as such in a cantina nearby. Upon arriving at the location to take the job, the Chistori and the Kilmaulsi, who were accompanied by several Neimoidians, found two competitors for the task, one of whom was the former Jedi Dass Jennir, with whom the reptile had previously fought over the job. Determined not to be beaten a second time the Chistori and his comrades attacked but were all defeated with relative ease by Jennir and subdued. During the fight Jennir brought his foot down on the Kilmaulsi's leg, causing a loud snapping sound and a squawk. The Kilmaulsi wore purple armor and brown pants during the fight and had green skin and blue eyes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kilmaulsi thug first appeared in 2009 in Dark Times: Blue Harvest, Part 2 the second of two mini-issues of the Star Wars: Dark Times comic book series which was designed as an introduction to the Blue Harvest story arc.
