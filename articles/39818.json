However, he was challenged by the master gambler Kinnin Vo-Shay at a hand of sabacc, who took pity on Nyo. Vo-Shay ultimately won nearly a quarter million credits from Doune; Doune suspected him of cheating. Doune hired the Barabel Yarrku to hunt down Vo-Shay's ship, the Ashanda Ray, and retrieve his lost money. Yarrku failed, so Doune bought the lightsaber that Nyo was seeking on Nar Shaddaa. Doune then challenged Vo-Shay to a round of sabacc: if Doune won, he would keep Vo-Shay's lucky charm. If Vo-Shay won, Doune would relinquish the lightsaber. At the Nygann Cantina on Nar Shaddaa, Vo-Shay lost and Doune won the charm. Doune, only wanting the pendant, left the lightsaber. Now that he had the obsidian charm, Doune felt confident on his future gambling career."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Doune was an obsessive gambler, and apparently liked to pick on weak targets. He gambled often, and was also very superstitious. When he was agitated, his skin, like all Herglics, would mottle.
