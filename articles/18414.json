A commando team was dispatched to destroy the shield generator before the bulk of the Alliance Fleet, led by the Mon Calamari Admiral Ackbar, arrived in the system to destroy the Death Star. Unbeknownst to the Alliance, they were falling into a trap orchestrated by Emperor Palpatine. When the Alliance Fleet arrived, they found the shield active and an Imperial fleet blocking their escape. The opposing armadas engaged one another in combat while the strike team struggled to accomplish their objective on Endor. As the space battle progressed, Commander Simms was killed following a Rebel attack on the Imperial main communications ship. One of Blue Wing's battle groups, Blue Squad, utilized A-wing fighters to great effect in combating and defeating the Imperial Fleet during the battle. Eventually, the strike team succeeded in destroying the shield generator, leaving the Death Star vulnerable to Rebel assault. General Lando Calrissian, flying the freighter Millennium Falcon as Gold Leader, led several starfighter squadrons\u2014including Blue Squadron, under Blue Wing\u2014in an attack on the Death Star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Scores of Rebel starfighters, followed closely by Imperial TIE fighters, skimmed low over the surface of the Death Star, looking for an entrance into its superstructure so they could find and destroy the station's reactor core.
