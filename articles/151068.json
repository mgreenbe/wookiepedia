They then forced the hunter to call Krix's hover pod, which they stole after incapacitating him. Together, Chewbacca and the Jedi were able to board the fortress and fought Garnac and his hunters until they were surrounded. Before the hunters could kill their new captives, General Tarfful and several his warriors, whom Chewbacca had previously contacted, arrived in Sugi's ship Halo. The combined force of Wookiees and Padawans were then able to finish the last of the hunters. Tano fought Garnac until she pushed him onto the lower decks to his death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Trophy collection"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The fortress had trophies that Garnac and his hunters had killed, skinned and placed in the bowels of the fortress.
