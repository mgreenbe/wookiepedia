Threnda operated a cantina in the city Teg Kithri on the planet Budpock, which she used as a front for an operation distributing the spice Tempest on behalf of the Bomu. In 19 ABY, the Jedi archivist Mander Zuma and the spacers Reen Irana and Eddey Be'ray set out to shut down the Tempest trade. They confronted Threnda and her Trandoshan assistant Mitt in the warehouse behind the back of her cantina, and they subsequently used a grenade to destroy her supplies of the spice, much to Threnda's protest."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
