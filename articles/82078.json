She had pointed ears and a canine nose, but otherwise appeared physically Human. In Roan Novachez's third year at the Jedi academy, she was a new transfer student. Despite being new to the academy, she demonstrated that she was already well trained in the use of the Force. On her first day, she was instructed to make a sandwich with Cronah's help, and created a virtual whirlwind neatly whipping all the condiments into one, sauce included. This amazed everyone except Cronah himself. Soon after, she beat Cyrus, an accomplished student, in lightsaber fencing. She was kind, however, and when the instructor Mr. Garfield took her victory as an opportunity to tell Novachez that he needed more training to live up to Lily's skill, she consoled him later, apologizing and stating that she was just trying to do her best. Lilly was a vegetarian and completely abstained from eating any meat. She hoped to gain more training in lightsaber fencing, but wasn't sure she'd be able to study it in detail when she learned that Cyrus had already chosen it as his specialized area of study for the school year. Like Novachez and his friend, Gaiana, she did not appreciate the bullying behavior of Cyrus and Cronah. Once, she was walking with Novachez and Gaiana, who was holding the class pet, the voorpak known as Voorpee. Cronah taunted Novachez and referred to him as Gaiana's \"OTHER pet,\" leading Lilly to ask Cyrus why his friend was so mean. Gaiana felt a bit insecure around her because Lilly seemed to be \"good at everything,\" and felt awkward when Roan taught Lilly how to ride shaaks. Roan reassured her that he was just trying to be helpful, which comforted Gaiana. Lilly soon had a boyfriend, who was Cyrus. For the Obstacle Course Trial, she went with Cyrus, Jo-Ahn, and Silva, and came in first."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lilly went to an academy on Ossus before transferring to Coruscant for unknown reasons.
