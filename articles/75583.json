The processes used by the criminal Pyke Syndicate to mine for spice in their mines on Kessel freed kessoline from the stones, poisoning many of the world's aquifers. The slaves working in the mines then burned the kessoline in order to power the machinery, producing clouds of toxic smoke that further damaged the environment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
