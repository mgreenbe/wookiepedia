Later, when Zaarin conducted a coup on the Emperor, Palpatine and Vader discussed the matter, with Palpatine declaring that the Secret Order of the Empire has notified him of the danger. He later used the throne room during the Zaarin insurrection where he requested that Thrawn carry out his hunt for Zaarin and stopping his TIE Defender project, eventually promoting him to Grand Admiral for the task. Later, just prior to the Battle of Endor, where Darth Vader had notified the Emperor that he had ensured that the Rebels had received the bait and that they are as they speak about to convene near Sullust to discuss how to take out the Death Star II, with the latter deciding to go to Endor personally so he can oversee the destruction of the Rebel Alliance. Prior to departing for Endor, however, he also was briefed by Thrawn on the progress of the hunt for Zaarin, where he was notified that the renegade Grand Admiral will soon be defeated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Layout"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The throne room possessed some similarities to the one aboard the Death Star II, including the same window behind the throne.
