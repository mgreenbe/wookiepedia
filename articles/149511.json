While its sister ship, Kethor, took credit for destroying the shield, Tritus bought the Revenants time to get down to the planet's surface to destroy the Trihexalon factory. After the fighters laid siege to the factory, Tritus played \"tug of war\" with the Sabaoth Destroyer, Reaver, as they fought for control of a dismantled orbital defense cannon high above the planet's surface. Tritus also led a strike force to destroy Captain Cavik Toth's fleet above Geonosis and later went planetside to help the Jedi forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
