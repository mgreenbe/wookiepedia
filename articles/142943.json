They bring them back to the Skandits' home and lock them in a root cell. After a while the Travelling Jindas arrive to perform. In an attempt to get help from them, Latara, an old friend of Bondo's, begins to play on her flute, which gets Bondo's attention and he goes over to the cage. This makes the Skandits angry so Bondo keeps Latara from saying anything and walks away, upsetting Latara. Later at the show, some dancers come over to the root cell along with Trebla.

They all run, and the other Jindas have already gotten the Awor racing away. The Skandits right behind them, the Ewoks swing to the top of one of the Awor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When they return home, all of the Ewoks' relatives celebrate, but the fun is cut short when rocks begin hurling themselves at the Jindas again. Chief Chirpa gets all of the Jindas up into the raised walkways of Bright Tree Village, and raise the stairway so the low-hovering rocks can't get up. They begin discussing this curse that the Jindas keep mentioning with Logray. Bondo ques some of the other Jindas to begin playing and singing a song. The song describes how the Jindas never used to travel but instead were farmers. They were protected by a mysterious Rock Wizard who only asked for food in return. But when they made a bad meal, the Rock Wizard thought they were trying to poison him and cast them out of his land, cursing them with the rock beings if they ever returned to his land or if they ever stopped for too long, explaining why they always got lost."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chief Chirpa decides to help them get home, so Logray and his apprentice Teebo, go down with the rocks and begin to chant. Suddenly animals come from all around tying up the rocks with vines and tying them to trees. They lower the stairs, and when Bondo goes down to the ground, the rocks begin to bounce but soon give up. This draws the Rock Wizard out to the village where he causes some chaos, angry Logray broke the curse."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kneesaa tries to help and when the Rock Wizard sees her he realizes she has his missing tooth, Kneesaa's lucky rock. He takes it and puts it back in and feels better for the replacement, outside the embarrassing fact realizing that he cursed a whole people over a dental problem. When Wicket explains that the tooth is supposed to be a good luck charm, the amused Rock Wizard notes that idea is apparently true considering it was a stroke of luck that it happened to be his missing tooth. Now in a far better mood, the Rock Wizard lifts the curse and lets the Jindas return home."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This is the first episode of the series that shows Logray and his star pupil Teebo interacting with the wild creatures from the forest of Endor, even before the young Teebo becoming Logray's apprentice at the episode \"Sunstar vs. Shadowstone.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
