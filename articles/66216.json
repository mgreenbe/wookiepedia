It had a pale blue blade, and was powered by a kyber crystal. During his time at Port Haileap with his Master, Douglas Sunvale, Cantaros disassembled the lightsaber, and had difficulty in reassembling it exactly as it had previously been, resulting in a weaker blade. Cantaros had the lightsaber with him when he was stranded on the jungle moon Wevo alongside Jedi Knight Vernestra Rwoh, inventor Avon Starros, Dalnan Honesty Weft and Starros' droid J-6 after an attack on the starship Steady Wing that had resulted in the death of Master Sunvale."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While they were stranded on the moon, Starros, having developed a fascination with lightsabers and kyber crystals during her time at Port Haileap, watched Cantaros attempt to repair his weapon. Having a hard time processing his grief, Cantaros gave in to his anger after discovering that the Nihil pirates responsible for the attack were also on the moon, but he was captured along with Weft after the two attempted a sneak attack on the pirates. Rwoh and Starros rescued the boys, but Rwoh was forced to duel Cantaros after he attempted to Force choke the pirate Klinith Da to death instead of taking her prisoner. During the duel, Cantaros' lightsaber was destroyed by Rwoh's lightwhip. Several days later, when a Jedi rescue party arrived, Starros stole the broken pieces of Cantaros' lightsaber, intending to experiment with them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imri's lightsaber was a single-bladed weapon with a pale blue blade, powered by a kyber crystal. Some time before becoming stranded on Wevo, Imri Cantaros had taken the lightsaber apart to repair it, but was not able to properly reassemble it to his liking, which resulted in a weaker blade which could cut foliage but had trouble with sturdier objects."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imri Cantaros built his lightsaber himself, wielding it while he was the Padawan of Jedi Master Douglas Sunvale. The two were stationed at Port Haileap in the Dalnan sector, where Sunvale served as the marshal. Jedi Knight Vernestra Rwoh, a prodigy who had passed her Jedi Trials at the age of fifteen, was also stationed at the outpost. A more recent arrival was Avon Starros, an aspiring inventor and scientist whose senator mother had sent her to Haileap to study under Professor Glenna Kip, who had a laboratory at the spaceport. However, Kip was offworld searching for an ancient artifact, so Sunvale included Starros alongside Cantaros' lessons even though she was not Force-sensitive. As a result, the girl developed a fascination with the Force and kyber crystals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 232 BBY, Cantaros disassembled his lightsaber to do some repairs to it. When he attempted to reassemble the weapon, he had difficulties, and was unable to restore the saber to the same state it had previously been in. The blade the weapon was able to project lacked the cutting power it had previously possessed, although it could cut through foliage. Cantaros asked Sunvale for assistance, and was advised that the lightsaber's problems would likely work themselves out if he kept working on the weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
