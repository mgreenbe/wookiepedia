The conflict was fought between the forces of the Sith Lord Nankrang and those of the Republic's allies in the Jedi Order. Nankrang was chosen to lead the operation by the Sith Emperor himself after the Dark Lord received a Force vision that depicted Nankrang's victory. That vision came to fruition in the Mid Rim, and Nankrang overcame the Jedi who opposed him and claimed victory for the Empire. The achievement was celebrated on the Imperial capital world of Dromund Kaas, along with those of Darth Ekkage and Lord Malichose."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The engagement in the Mid Rim was first mentioned in Shades of the Sith, the first act in the three-part comic book story arc, Star Wars: The Old Republic, Blood of the Empire.
