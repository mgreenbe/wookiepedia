The planet was home to the amphibious creatures known as lurkers. After a heist on the nearby planet Guat'a, a group of the Spice Runners of Kijimi escaped through the Torch Nebula along the Llanic Spice Run, but were forced to land on Judakann by the Osako pirates, who were working with Kes Dameron and L'ulo L'ampar to find Dameron's son Poe. While Poe Dameron, at that point a member of the Spice Runners, encountered his father, the group were attacked by lurkers, forcing Dameron and L'ampar to retreat to a nearby Moraysian cruiser."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Judakann first appeared in the 2020 young-adult novel Poe Dameron: Free Fall, by Alex Segura.
