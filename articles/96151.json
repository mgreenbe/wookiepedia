Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, violence sparked between two space stations in the Bright Jewel system known as Tansarii Point Station and Station Gamma. To settle the dispute, Neina traveled to Station Gamma to speak to a Rak'qua Fervent, one of Gamma's leaders. However, when two days passed without hearing word from Neina, Moria grew concerned, and asked a spacer to investigate her disappearance. Ultimately, the Rak'qua Fervent agreed to let Neina go, only if the spacer could succeed in hunting down and defeating one of his shamans in mortal combat. In the end, the spacer succeeded in this test of strength, thus earning Neina's freedom."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Neina was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
