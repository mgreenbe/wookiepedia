In 20 BBY, the Resolute, alongside a fleet of Republic warships, engaged the Separatist fleet of Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress in the Sullust system. During the battle, the Resolute was attacked by Ventress in a Ginivex-class fanblade starfighter and droid tri-fighters, which attacked several of the vessel's vital systems, while Ventress assaulted the bridge, resulting in the Resolute's destruction, but not before its crew managed to escape the vessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stationed aboard the Resolute's command bridge was the vessel's command unit.

After the Confederacy's capture of the planet, a blockade of thirty warships was established in orbit under Harch Admiral Trench to prevent the Republic from interfering, which resulted in Senator Bail Organa and his troopers becoming trapped on the surface. Sometime later, Jedi General Anakin Skywalker aboard the Resolute, alongside a fleet of two other Venator-class Star Destroyers and three Pelta-class frigates, were dispatched by the Republic to break through the blockade and deliver relief supplies to Senator Organa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following their arrival, the Resolute and its accompanying warships proceeded to engage Trench's fleet, trading fire with the Separatist battleships. However, while the two fleets fired upon one another, the Separatist flagship made its advancement on the Resolute unopposed, forcing the Star Destroyer's crew to raise its forward shields to maximum power. Releasing a barrage of turbolaser fire upon the Republic fleet, the dreadnought managed to destroy one of the frigates, which resulted in Skywalker ordering the fleet to charge through the blockade, despite the loss of one of the frigates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly thereafter, Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi arrived in the system aboard his flagship, the Negotiator, and ordered Skywalker and his fleet to withdraw and restrategize behind the moon of Leesis.

Upon their arrival, Koon contacted General Skywalker and Commander Tano aboard the Resolute in the nearby Bith system in hopes of receiving reinforcements. However, amid their conversation, Skywalker lost contact with Koon and his fleet, which had been destroyed by the Malevolence, resulting in both Skywalker and Tano departing to the Abregado system in search of survivors.

Departing from the Resolute, Skywalker, alongside his Padawan, Koon, and Shadow Squadron, took a shortcut through the Kaliida Nebula, where they met with the Malevolence upon exiting the nebula. As the battle began, the Republic squadron proceeded to make their attack run on the Separatist battleship, targeting its command bridge in order to destroy it and Grievous, but lost almost half of their fighters during their run, forcing them to break off and target the Malevolence's ion cannon, overloading the weapon and crippling the entire warship upon its attempt to fire.
