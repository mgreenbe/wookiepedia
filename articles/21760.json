It was manufactured by Merr-Sonn Munitions, Inc.. It had a metallic sphere covered in beam splitters and a clublike handle. The grenade held energy in optical capacitors that would discharge when it was used. The blast would hit the beam splitters and cover the area in stunning energy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was designed to be recovered, recharged and reused. This often led to the grenades later being used against the troops who originally used them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
