As a result, she gained a reputation among the Empire as a master of beasts. In 3643 BBY, during the Cold War between the Empire and the Galactic Republic, Seake was sent to the planet Taris and tasked with wiping out one of the Republic's new colony settlements that it was establishing as part of its resettlement efforts. Seake was also alerted to the presence of Watcher One, an agent of the Empire's intelligence branch who was working for the Sith Lord Darth Angral.

The Knight had learned of Seake's mission from the Imperial operative Watcher One and had rushed to intercept the assassin. As the presence of Seake and her jurgorans sent the colonists into a panic, the assassin warned the colonists that they should not have returned to Taris, and she questioned the Jedi as to how her opponent had learned of her supposedly secret mission.

The mission is only received if the player has a positive light side alignment at the end of the previous mission, while dark side players are instead sent to acquire stolen Jedi relics from pirates. Players can also refuse the mission to help the colonists, which rewards the player with dark side alignment points. As the Jedi Knight is a Republic class and is thus assumed to make decisions that reward in the maximum light side points, this article assumes the player saved the colonists and killed Seake. According to the game's text files, players originally were able to Force Persuade Seake into leaving, but that option was removed from the final game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
