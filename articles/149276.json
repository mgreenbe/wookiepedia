Aqua droids were deployed and assembled them underwater. After the drilling ships were completely assembled, they rose from the ocean and attacked the city. The opposing clone troopers could not damage the drills with their normal DC-15Ss, DC-15A blaster rifles, or DC-17 hand blasters, but the drills were severely damaged towards the end of the battle when the clones used missile launchers. The battle was eventually lost by the Confederacy of Independent Systems."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ships were later used during the second battle of Mon Calamari as troop deployment craft, patrol ships, and assault ships with one ship acting as Riff Tamson's command ship. They were used first to release large amounts of Aqua droids. After the Mon Calamari civilians were rounded up and taken to prison camps the ships were then used to patrol the waters surrounding the city. When the Gungan Grand Army came as the Republic's reinforcements, Tamson used the ships to create whirlpools which sucked up anyone in the surrounding waters except Tamson and his aqua droids. After the Mon Calamari, Quarren, Gungans, and Republic forces sided together to fight the Separatists, the ships were used to simply ram enemy targets in the water and would plow through formations of the allied troops. However, some of the Mon Cala fighters and Gungan warriors used their weapons to punch holes in the port holes of one of the drills causing water to run into the hull and destroying the drill."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There appear to be two different variants of the ship seen in the show. A small version that is used by Asajj Ventress and a much larger version that is used on both Kamino and Mon Calamari.
