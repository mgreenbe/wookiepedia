They designed the Baas-class space station and following the Empire's approval of the design, Durastar demonstrated that the station could be constructed quickly and efficiently, by constructing a prototype in just 25 standard days. Pleased with these results, the Empire ordered dozens of the stations and gave Durastar sufficient capital to expand its facilities, so that it could complete the order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not wanting to disappoint the Empire, Durastar devoted all of its resources to the Baas-class stations, to ensure that they were a high-quality product. As a result, they neglected their other clients, who deserted Durastar and found better service elsewhere. With few clients left, Durastar Construction went out of business just months after completing the Baas-class station order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
