Candidates fought much like they did in the Test of Fury, save for lacking the light of Dathomir's four moons. Fighters sometimes employed the technique known as the Ears of the Chiroptix to pass the trial. Only Savage Opress and Feral passed the Test of Night during Asajj Ventress's Selection."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
