This led to the native Hakarans send a distress signal to the Galactic Republic, however, their language was not known by the Jedi Order.

However, when the swarms destroyed an attacking battle droid by attacking its neural processor - Ahsoka determined that they were intelligent. General Skywalker then communicated to the Hakarans by way of the Force and told them how to best combat the battle droids. This saw the Hakarans attack in large swarms and destroy the droids inhabiting the Confederate base on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the incident, Anakin Skywalker decided that the planet would be protected by the Jedi Order while an ambassador from the Republic would be dispatched to speak with the native Hakarans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
