The former contained the planet Artom, and the latter was the site of the cold and windswept high-gravity desert world T'surr, which orbited a weak sun. T'surr was the homeworld of the sentient T'surr species. Although the males were the dominant T'surr gender on their homeworld, the females had the ultimate authority in T'surr homes, making many of the males anxious to leave their home planet for the wider galaxy. While T'surr could already be found off-world by 1032 BBY, the species had no representation in either the Senate of the Galactic Republic or in that of the New Republic due to the perceived nature of the T'surr as aggressive killers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 232 BBY, Artom became the first discovery of Reidi Artom, a Republic scout who was dispatched to the Expansion Region to survey any star systems missed by previous explorers.
