Symptoms included fatigue and loss of appetite. Blactonecrosis could be masked by the consumption of lotiramine, which hid the tracer enzymes marking the disease's presence in the body. In addition to causing severe bacta allergies in all patients, the purposely contaminated bacta from Lot ZX1449F caused roughly two percent of those exposed to contract blastonecrosis. In these cases, blastonecrosis was incurable, as bacta was the only effective treatment for the disease."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
