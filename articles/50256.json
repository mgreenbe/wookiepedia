Following the Galactic Empire's destruction of the planet Alderaan, a convoy of Alderaanian refugee vessels escaped to Fostar Haven. The Empire's Helix Squadron were subsequently sent to destroy the convoy. When the Imperials started scanning the vessels in the nearby space, the Stationmaster objected, ultimately firing on Helix Squadron. The squadron's leader, Lindon Javes, who could not stand for attacking the refugees, betrayed the Empire, assisting the convoy in their escape. The Rebel Alliance received a distress signal from the refugees, and sent Echo Squadron to support the fleeing convoy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fostar Haven appeared in the 2020 video game Star Wars: Squadrons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
