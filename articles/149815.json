A school for training run by the Jedi Order, Master Jassa rebuffed the Gotal Jedi Initiate Kith Kark twice before agreeing to train him in the Jedi ways. The praxeum was located high in the mountains of Truuine's polar regions and was afforded a grand oceanic view from which students could watch icebergs topple from the glacial cliffs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
