Years earlier during the Liberation of Lothal, Bridger had summoned a pod of purrgil to defeat the Seventh Fleet, and, after those starships were dealt with, the animals attacked the Star Destroyer Chimaera, pulling it, Grand Admiral Thrawn, and Bridger away into hyperspace to deep space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because of this, Bridger and Thrawn were absent throughout the rest of the Galactic Civil War, though the Grand Admiral's legacy in the Empire lived on. During Bridger's absence, Wren had initially thought he had wanted her to protect his homeworld of Lothal, but she eventually realized he wanted her to find him. The mission began five years after Tano's promise to Bridger that she would find him when she got back during their time in the World Between Worlds, when Tano led Wren on the search to find the still-living Bridger and bring him home to Lothal aboard their T-6 shuttle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The search for Ezra first appeared in the series finale of Star Wars Rebels, \"Family Reunion \u2013 and Farewell\".
