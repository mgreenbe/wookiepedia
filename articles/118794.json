During the war for the moon Alaris Prime fought between the Trade Federation and the rightful Wookiee colonists between 39 BBY and 36 BBY, SRAM-13 commanded the Trade Federation's primary base on the moon, which contained a fortress. SRAM-13 also commanded the base's associated droid units, which included battle droids, aircraft, OX9 labor droids, and utility trawlers which gathered fish from the nearby river. Near the end of the war, the Wookiees established a settlement south of the Trade Federation base, with several sentry posts outside its walls to alert them of Trade Federation movements."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "SRAM-13 made the first strike against the Wookiees in what became the Battle for Alaris Prime, sending a ground force of five beetle droids and a droideka to attack the sentry posts. SRAM-13 also sent a trio of light droid starfighters to scout the Wookiee base, prompting the Wookiees' advisor, Qui-Gon Jinn, to recommend that they build up their own air defences. Eventually, the Wookiee leader Chewbacca built up a fighting force to assault the base, destroying its turrets with Heavy Blade bombers and destroying the droids there. SRAM-13 lost the battle when the Wookiees destroyed the fortress with energy pummels, which expelled the Trade Federation presence from Alaris Prime."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "SRAM-13 was mentioned in the 2001 LucasArts video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, in which the individual was named as the leader of the Trade Federation forces in the seventh level of the Wookiee tutorial campaign, \"The Battle for Alaris Prime.\" Unlike other levels in the tutorial which have only a single enemy team, SRAM-13 commands two allied teams.
