When the company collapsed in the following years, its resources were liquidated and the \"T1\"-series trademark was purchased by Duwani Mechanical Products. As a result, the defunct company's T1 line of droids became better known as the \"LB\" series, perhaps so as to differentiate it from a new and unrelated line of T1 droids being produced by Duwani. Kellenech Technologies also made the KT-400, a military droid carrier used during the Mandalorian Wars and Jedi Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
