The Petition stated that, since the war's end was nearing, Palpatine should give up the emergency powers he had assumed since the end of the Separatist Crisis, which Anakin Skywalker realized would never happen under this Chancellor. It also specifically denounced the resurrected office of Moff, as it would make the Senate essentially powerless."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Galactic Republic's transformation into the Galactic Empire, many senators removed their signatures from the petition."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
