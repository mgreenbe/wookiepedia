Conventional models, with their unmistakable spherical cockpit and solar panel-terminated wings, were cheap to produce and therefore manufactured in large numbers by the Empire, but the specialized models had far superior performance that made them adversaries to be reckoned with by any Rebellion starfighter. The First Order would take the concept of the TIE fighter and take it a step further, building ships with increasingly powerful weaponry and armor, to create some models that could take on a squad of enemy fighters alone. Even the Sith Eternal fleet would count with a TIE fighter as one of its main vehicles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gideon is mistakenly referred to as a Grand Moff."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
