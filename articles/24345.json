Because of a shortage of spare parts, usually only one or two of the starfighters were operational at any given time. During the insurrection on Jedha by Saw Gerrera and his Partisans, at least one of the X-wings was shot down, where it crashed in the streets of Jedha City. Once the Imperials launched their major combat deployment during the Jedha insurgency, four of the X-wings were launched to strike back. Three of them were shot down, and the fourth was chased into the wilderness by six TIE fighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several of the Cavern Angels' X-wings appear in the 2016 film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Cavern Angels' colors were one of the multiplayer starfighter cosmetic options in the 2020 game Star Wars: Squadrons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
