When the charismatic Count Dooku founded the Confederacy in 24 BBY, the swaths of sectors and star systems seceding from the Galactic Republic formed their own congressional assembly to oversee the Separatist state. A number of the appointed delegates, having served as members of the Republic Senate prior to their secession, continued to represent their constituents in the Confederacy. Operating by a bill of rights known as the Bylaws of Independent Systems, the Parliament was headed by the Confederate Head of State, Dooku, as well as by Separatist Congress Leader Bec Lawise. It became headquartered on the Separatist capital of Raxus Secundus, where sessions were held in the Separatist Senate Building."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the representative voices of the Parliament gained a role in state matters, various elements of the Separatist hierarchy often rendered them ineffective. The corporate interests on the Separatist Council also made governmental decisions, and Dooku himself\u2014who was secretly the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Tyranus\u2014manipulated situations to ensure that pan-galactic war continued for the purposes of the Sith. At times maneuvers on the part of other war-profiteering parties negated legislation that the Parliament had enacted; some came to see the assembly's members as Dooku's pawns. Furthermore, the senators of the Parliament as well as the citizens of the Confederacy were repeatedly shielded from front-line reports of brutal campaigns waged by such commanders of the Separatist Droid Army as General Grievous. Ultimately, the Confederacy was regarded more as a movement instead of a centralized government, in spite of the Parliament's involvement in public affairs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A wide range of views comprised the Parliament, leading to a division of positions about maintaining the war effort against the Republic. In 21 BBY, after the Clone Wars had been raging for over a year, Senator Mina Bonteri of Onderon, in collaboration with Republic Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, introduced a bill to open peace negotiations with the Republic. Her bill passed in session by a majority, and the Parliament's motion for peace was extended to the Republic Senate. Yet Dooku conspired with a group of war profiteers to ensure that the Republic rejected the offer, culminating with his orchestration of Bonteri's murder and the withdrawal of the proposal. A delegation later represented the Parliament at an unprecedented peace conference with Republic congresspeople on Mandalore, but the talks similarly failed.

The Confederate Head of State, serving as the leader of the Senate, was also allowed to officiate at sessions. In addition to member worlds, corporations such as the Corporate Alliance were granted representation, becoming a part of the legislature's decision-making. While in session, individual congresspeople could propose legislation, which required a majority vote to be enacted into law.

As a separatist government, the Confederacy consisted of sectors and star systems seceding from the Republic as well as megacorporations and trade cartels such as the Corporate Alliance, Trade Federation, InterGalactic Banking Clan, and Commerce Guild, among others. These conglomerates were represented on the Separatist Council, which existed alongside the civilian-based Parliament. With the wide reach of philosophies, some political and others corporate-driven, the Separatists fell into more of a hierarchy than a formal, centralized government. Such was the framework of the Confederacy that at times the Parliament's decrees were ignored, manipulated, or made ineffectual. Count Dooku himself, Head of State of the Confederacy, had a hand in invalidating Parliament legislation as part of schemes that the Order of the Sith Lords concocted. Senator Lux Bonteri believed that Dooku would betray the members of the Parliament if his machinations warranted such expedience."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Separatist delegates who were affiliated with companies like the Corporate Alliance garnered criticism for perpetuating corporate voices in political affairs, as was the case in the Republic Senate. Yet those same galactic enterprises were the cornerstone of the Confederacy, as their security forces constituted the Confederacy military, particularly the Separatist Droid Army. Furthermore, Parliament members as well as Separatist citizens were constantly kept in the dark about the exploits and onslaughts of ruthless military commanders such as General Grievous. This conduct resulted in an incomplete view of the Separatists' presence in the galactic war theater, creating further problems for the Parliament. Some individuals on the side of the Republic saw the Separatist senators as pawns of Dooku, while the Parliament itself was widely considered abortive due to the formation of the Separatist hierarchy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Formation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Confederacy of Independent Systems was founded in the year 24 BBY, when the charismatic Count Dooku, a former Jedi Master, delivered fiery rhetoric that criticized the Republic Senate of corruption, with the Jedi Order guilty for supporting such a regime that was beyond saving. The Raxus Address, as his speech was dubbed, established the Confederacy as a separatist state from the Republic. Thousands of sectors and star systems began issuing Articles of Secession to the Republic, flocking to the Confederacy alongside megacorporations including the Trade Federation, InterGalactic Banking Clan, Corporate Alliance, Techno Union, and others seeking Dooku's promise of free trade. In reality, the Confederacy was created to secretly serve the Grand Plan of the Order of the Sith Lords, of which Dooku was a member under the alter ego of Darth Tyranus. While Tyranus led the Confederacy into war with the Republic, the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious\u2014in his guise as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine of the Republic\u2014would destabilize the Republic so that the Sith could eventually claim absolute power over the galaxy. The Confederacy was thus a sham, the result of Sith plotting against the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over six thousand worlds joined the Confederacy during the period of tensions termed the Separatist Crisis, which lasted from 24 BBY to 22 BBY. The InterGalactic Banking Clan, Trade Federation, and their fellow Separatist-loyal companies officially signed on to the cause in 22 BBY, pledging their financial support as well as their standing security forces to the Confederate military. When the First Battle of Geonosis erupted that year, the corporations' various battle droid security forces, eventually organized as the Separatist Droid Army, were deployed against the newly-created Grand Army of the Republic.

Senator Bec Lawise became the Separatist Congress Leader, presiding over Parliament sessions alongside Confederate Head of State Dooku.

The Confederacy's appointed Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies, General Grievous, committed many exploits on the front lines, but the politicians and citizens of the Confederacy were kept unaware of his crimes as well as other atrocities being performed in their name against the Republic.

Yet the majority of delegates had difficulty deciding if they should cast their support to further expansion of their armed forces. Similar conditions in the Republic Senate came to a head in 21 BBY, the second year of the war, and led Republic Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo to journey to Raxus Secundus in violation of the Republic's non-contact statute. A vocal advocate for diplomacy amidst the increasing cacophony of the Republic Senate, Amidala was concerned about a rising bill in her own Senate that would deregulate the galactic banks, opening new lines of credit to expand the Republic Military and thus increase the fighting. She traveled to Raxus Secundus with Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano to seek out a meeting with Mina Bonteri of Onderon, who had mentored her in politics during her early career, in the hopes of ending the war via diplomatic negotiations. In talks with her former colleague, Amidala convinced Bonteri that if the Separatist Parliament extended an olive branch of peace, there might be enough of a sympathetic response in the Republic Senate to begin formal intergovernmental dialogue. Bonteri agreed and promised to tender a motion for peace to the Parliament."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bonteri drafted her bill, which would immediately sanction an offer for peace negotiations to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and the Republic, and introduced it at a following Parliament session. She prefaced her proposal, to cries of support and rejection from all sides of the Separatist Senate Building, by decrying the futility of the war's casualties and calling for a peaceful coexistence between Confederate and Republic worlds. Once she had finished, numerous senators stood up to applaud her words, though other delegates did not agree. Among the dissenters was Senator Voe Atell, an affiliate of the Corporate Alliance, who asserted that the commerce guild would never allow the passage of such a proposal. Senator Kerch Kushi disputed her claims, citing the democratic system of the Parliament as well as its lack of corporate governance. Amidst the widespread debate that broke out after Kushi's statements, Count Dooku called for order so that Bonteri's bill could be brought to a vote. As per the Bylaws of Independent Systems, Dooku held a voice vote, with Senators Bonteri, Kushi, By Bluss, and Amita Fonti among the supporters. Voting nay were Atell, Punn Rimbaud, and a number of others, but they were ultimately outvoted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the enactment of Bonteri's bill, Amidala returned with Tano to the Republic capital of Coruscant. Palpatine was skeptical of the Separatists' offer for peace given their past refusals for negotiation, but Amidala confidentially assured him of its sincerity because of its origination with Bonteri, allowing the vote to be brought to the Senate floor. No party was less alarmed by the Parliament's offer than the coalition pushing for Republic banking deregulation, consisting of Trade Federation Senator Lott Dod, InterGalactic Banking Clan lobbyist Nix Card, and Senator Gume Saam, the latter of whom was receiving payoffs from the Techno Union. All three profited from the war through their corporate affiliations and had already arranged\u2014through their secret ties to Dooku\u2014for an attack on Coruscant to panic the Senate into passing the deregulation legislation. On Dooku's orders, without Parliament authorization, Grievous had a team of Infiltrator/Demolition droids sabotage the Coruscant power network. The assault coincided with the Republic Senate's vote on the bank reform bill, which had its intended effect. Reported as an act of Separatist terrorism, the bombing of the power generator portrayed the Parliament's offer for peace as insincere and, much to Amidala's dismay, prompted the Senate to overwhelmingly vote in favor of banking deregulation. The Senate later rejected the Parliament's motion in light of the attack on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With negotiations with the Republic thwarted, Dooku swiftly engineered a secret attack on Confederate territory in which Sith assassins murdered Bonteri, then publicly alleged that she had been killed in a Republic assault that had targeted the people of the Confederacy.

Although Republic spies uncovered evidence of Bonteri's assassination, many Parliament members did not believe that their Head of State had executed their highly esteemed colleague or that he was even capable of such wrongdoing.

In accordance with Mandalorian law, both delegations were to remain unarmed, though the Parliament senators' BX-series droid commandos were equipped with blasters as security droids. As soon as Amidala, the leader of the Republic representatives, opened the conference, the Separatist delegation's first order of business was to address an age-old issue for the Confederacy: the legitimacy of the Separatist state. Speaking for her fellow delegates, Atell demanded that the Republic confer political recognition on the Confederacy, an act that Amidala and her colleagues hesitated to perform."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The proceedings were thereafter interrupted by Lux Bonteri, who had recently resigned from the Parliament and renounced his Separatist affiliations.

Lawise ordered his security droids to arrest Bonteri and remove him from the royal palace. Although Kryze objected to the droids' handing of Bonteri, Atell cited the matter as an internal affair, blocking outside interference. Lawise apologized on the Separatists' behalf for the interruption and allowed the discussions to continue, though they ultimately failed to bear fruit. The deliberations broke down due to shadowy interests on both sides, with the Senate and Parliament delegations unable to negotiate an end the war. Further adding to the tensions was the discovery that Bonteri had escaped from custody aboard the Separatists' C-9979 landing craft at the Sundari docks with the aid of an old friend, Ahsoka Tano, who was serving as Amidala's bodyguard.

The proceedings saw direct interference from Dooku, who\u2014having aided Clovis's rise to power\u2014engineered a plot to usurp control of the banks. On behalf of the Confederacy, Dooku refused to pay the interest on their loans from the Banking Clan, manipulating Clovis into instead raising the Republic's interest rates. Dooku then brought a Confederate Navy flotilla to Scipio, decimating the Republic's on-world security garrison in order to implicate Clovis in a partisan alliance with the Separatists. After Dooku arrested Padm\u00e9 Amidala, the leader of the Republic delegation, Lawise voiced opposition to his scheme, as he believed that the Parliament would not approve so brazen a move.
