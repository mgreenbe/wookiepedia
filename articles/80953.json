Her first lightsaber was created by her twin brother, Luke Skywalker, during the Thrawn campaign in 9 ABY, and was used by Mara Jade to kill both Luuke Skywalker and Joruus C'baoth. This lightsaber had a green blade. She later made use of a yellow bladed weapon and duelled the fallen Hutt Jedi Beldorion with it on Nam Chorios. The lightsaber Luke gifted her in 18 ABY had a ruby-red blade. Her fourth weapon was a blue bladed lightsaber that she used throughout the Swarm War and thereafter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
