The two were often at war. Hobors had purple skin and lived a tribal life, many of them refusing to learn Basic. They were led by Chief Nimondro. In the years prior to the Battle of Yavin, both species appealed to the Tion Hegemony to mediate a generations-old debate. When Counselor Harthan arrived, he was manipulated out of his position by his son, Jake Harthan, who desired both species annihilated. The younger Harthan's plans were thwarted, however, by a pair of droids, C-3PO and R2-D2."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
