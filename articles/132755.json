The scene is broadcast into the casinos on The Wheel where the patrons watch in horror at the viciousness of the Rebels. Also part of Greyshade's scheme is to have Han Solo and Chewbacca each killed while playing in separate events of The Big Game gladiator contest, but Solo confounds him by defeating his powerful opponent much to everyone's surprise. Meanwhile, the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO have been appropriated by The Wheel, and are scheduled to have their memories wiped when Master-Com rescues them from their fate. The three droids then go to the medical center to see to Luke Skywalker, only to find that not only has he regained consciousness but he has escaped."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This issue's letters page contains a letter from former Marvel Star Wars writer Roy Thomas commenting on how the storylines that he created have been developed since he left the series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
