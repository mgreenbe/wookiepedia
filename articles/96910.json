The security droids were used aboard New Republic Correctional Transports. When boarding a prison transport, the Bothan-Five, to rescue the prisoner Qin, a team of mercenaries recruited by Ranzar Malk encountered a number of the security droids. The droids were destroyed by the bounty hunter known as the Mandalorian. The team later betrayed the Mandalorian, trapping him in a cell, but the bounty hunter pulled a security droid towards him with a grappling hook and tore off its arm, using it to unlock the door. These droids were also used in the Karthon Chop Fields. One of them gave new instruction to Migs Mayfeld to follow Carasynthia Dune."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
