Surrounded by starships, it was grounded on Taivas. During the Attack on the Hidden Temple, it remained on the ground when the rest of the temple rose into the air. An Annihilator-class starfighter crashed into it, killing Masters T'ra Saa and Rawk and destroying the chamber. The two focused a beam of light at the moment of their deaths, which rose into space and destroyed several enemy ships of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire, thereby creating an escape corridor for the overmatched Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
