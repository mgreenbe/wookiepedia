The stories claimed that Peter Mayhew, the actor who played Chewbacca, was required to be accompanied by crewmembers who wore brightly-colored vests while in the Californian forests of the Pacific Northwest, filming scenes set on Endor, so as not to be mistaken for Bigfoot and shot. Working from there, Blackman crafted a story that involved Solo and Chewbacca landing on Earth in the Pacific Northwest, Solo dying, and Chewbacca being mistaken for Bigfoot while roaming the forests in the proceeding years. Taking the long life spans of Wookiees into account, he decided to have Indiana Jones discover Solo's remains over 100 years later."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Blackman included several explicit references to both the Star Wars and Indiana Jones films in the story in an effort to appeal to fans of both franchises\u2014for example, Solo compares Earth to Endor, referencing the fact that Return of the Jedi's Endor scenes were filmed in the Pacific Northwest (Chewbacca is also called \"Sasquatch\" in the comic by the local Native Americans). Solo utters the line \"I have a bad feeling about this place,\" a variation on a line spoken in every Star Wars film, and, just before dying, tells Chewbacca \"I'm going first into the great unknown,\" echoing a line spoken by Jones's friend Wu Han in the film Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. The story's title, \"Into the Great Unknown\", also comes from Wu Han's line, and is written on the first page of the comic in the style of the Indiana Jones franchise logo. Indiana Jones is accompanied to the Pacific Northwest by Short Round, his sidekick from Temple of Doom, although only the nicknames \"Dr. Jones\" and \"Shorty\" are used in the comic.
