During the Run, the Human Dindau was Captain of it, the albino Wookiee Kohlbacca was first mate and Herren, another Human, was the ship's engineer and gunner. However, the ship was severely damaged after a collision with an asteroid. Dindau sent out a distress call and it was picked up by the Neeva-Beelo, a YT-1300 light freighter that was carrying the Heroes of Cularin. They attempted a rescue and tried to get the three crew members off the Daring before its life support systems failed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
