During the reign of the Galactic Empire, students in the Core Worlds Classical Culture class at the Royal Imperial Academy on the planet Coruscant studied this composer's works. Several years before the Battle of Yavin, the class's professor asked his students what Igern's most famous work was, and was correctly answered by the student Ciena Ree; however, when Ree could not answer what themes the opera was best known for, her classmate Thane Kyrell provided the answer instead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Igern was first mentioned in the novel Lost Stars which was written by Claudia Gray and released in 2015."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
