Meanwhile aboard Crimson Jack's space cruiser, Han Solo is trying to talk his way out of trouble when Jack and his crew realize that they have been duped into coming to Drexel. But Quarg's jamming equipment on the planet's surface causes a disruption on the space cruiser, which is enough of a diversion to allow Solo, Chewbacca, and Princess Leia Organa to escape in the Millennium Falcon to the surface below. The Falcon splashes onto the water covered surface of Drexel, right in the middle of an epic battle between Quarg's men, piloting hydra craft, and the Dragon Lords. One of the hydra craft attacks the Falcon just as its occupants are exiting from its top hatch. Luke, who is also piloting a hydra craft in the battle, immediately turns on his new comrades and rushes to save the fallen Rebels. He finds only Chewbacca, who, thinking Luke was responsible for the attack, becomes enraged at the young Rebel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Bob Wiacek was uncredited this issue, the letters page in Star Wars 18 reveals that he did indeed ink two pages in this issue."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In flashback, Quarg talks about the wreck-and-salvage operation his father used to run back in the days of the Old Republic.
