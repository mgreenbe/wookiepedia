He served together with Felix Iresso on Althir III and they both were captured by the Sith. After the Sith Lord Darth Ouzal tried to duplicate the informations contained in a Sith holocron into the brain of the two prisoners. The experiment of the Sith Lord was a success as Iresso had locked in a corner of his brain a library of Sith knowledge, but Pellam became mad. Some time later, he destroyed a starship belonging to a gangster, thinking it contained Doctor Sera Fray: the woman responsible for his madness. He was consequently arrested and held in isolation in Tatooine. Eventually Iresso found Milo in a prison on Tatooine and learned the truth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
