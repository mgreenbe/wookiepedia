There, Leonis and Bridger struck up a friendship and alliance to steal a decoder from ISB Agent Kallus. In the process, Ezra discovered that the Grand Inquisitor had shown interest in Jai Kei's Force sensitivity. Leonis and Bridger subsequently engineered Kell's escape from the Academy.

However, Thrawn's personal assassin Rukh had survived the battle at the rebel base and alerted Grand Admiral Thrawn, who was returning from Coruscant, about the situation.

Sabine's plan work and the rebels were able to use the Dome's deflector shield to protect Capital City from a second bombardment wave. Shortly later, Ezra's back-up plan arrived in the form of a large pod of purrgil including many enormous Purrgil Ultras which attacked Thrawn's Seventh Fleet.
