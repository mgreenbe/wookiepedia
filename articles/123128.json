The residential areas were vastly different, divided geographically as well as financially. While the city's rich citizens dwelled in large estates on the west side and enjoyed a lavish existence, the city's poor and middle classes lived on the east and south sides in moderate and sometimes squalor conditions. Most of the city's beggars could be found here, wandering the streets or hiding in alleyways and abandoned buildings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith Commander Doel Scherp owned a house which he used for shore leave at the beginning of the Jedi Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
