Though it wasn't fast or maneuverable, the battleframe could prove deadly. Providing the wearer with six mounts along the frame, each mount capable of holding weapons, ammunition, or energy packs, the battleframe transformed the wearer into a walking arsenal. At full capacity, the battleframe could support three different heavy weapons and accompanying ammo canisters or power packs. The battleframe also provided limited protection against return fire and other hazards. The market value of a battleframe was 12,000 credits without any attachments or weapons. The entire unit weighed roughly 20 kilograms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
