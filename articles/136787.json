In 3 ABY, when the Galactic Empire deployed a large force of Experimental fighters and two Beta-class ETR-3 escort transports to destroy the convoy, the Rebels sprang their trap. Using the newly released Ion pulse warheads, six Rebel pilots controlled by Admiral Yamarus and flying Z-95 Headhunters, attacked the enemy. Ace Azzameen was the #2 craft. The Rebels disabled most if not all of the Imperial craft, and then Heavy Lifter group Atlas stole one of each craft type. Several ships in cargo group Sulin were destroyed or damaged, but they succeeded in trapping the Empire's valuable new starfighters. They fled the area after the mission was completed, and Yamarus was able to use the valuable intelligence to stop the experimental project."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If the player saves six Mobquet Transports after waiting for them to leave for several minutes, he/she can earn five-hundred bonus points.
