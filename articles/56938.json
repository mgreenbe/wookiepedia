The name \u201cGreeata\u201d was a common name for female Rodians meaning \u201ctalented.\u201d Rather than focus on hunting, Greeata absorbed any information she could find on the music and dance of many intergalactic cultures. Having rejected the values of Rodian culture, Greeata left her homeworld to perform as a Kloo horn player aboard the intergalactic cruiseliner Kuari Princess. In 19 BBY, she visited Coruscant and was present at the Squid Lake performance at the Galaxies Opera House."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Greeata developed a friendship with Sy Snootles, lead singer for Kuari Princess's house band. After forcefully rejecting the sexual advances of a male Rodian, Greeata and Sy left the house band to perform as a duo. Evar Orbus discovered the pair performing in the Green Planet nightclub on Tothis. Mesmerized by Snootles' voice, Orbus asked her to audition for his band. While excited, Snootles said that she would only join if Orbus offered Greeata a spot. After learning that Greeata could sing, dance, and play the Kloo horn, Evar signed her on as a dancer on a per diem rate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After fifteen years of dancing with Lyn Me and Ryst\u00e1ll Sant, Greeata was first accepted as a full member when Max Rebo founded his own band. During her tenure in Jabba the Hutt's palace, the Rodian wore bracelets that suppressed her pheromones. In 4 ABY, when fellow dancer Oola was fed to the rancor, Greeata was horrified and covered her face with her hands, unable to look. However, it was not long after Greeata began singing with the Max Rebo Band that Jabba was killed and his sail barge destroyed. In the chaos that followed, Greeata's Rodian survival instincts saved the band from a pack of Tusken Raiders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Greeata and Ryst\u00e1ll later joined The Palpatones, where they were reunited with Joh Yowza.
