When Anakin Skywalker and Mace Windu were trapped on the Endurance at Vanqor, R2-D2 rushed into the Temple to play their distress message, jostling the R4 unit as he sped past. It was seen with an unidentified blue R5 unit. It was later seen aboard CC-3636's transport during the Mission to Aleen and then on Adi Gallia's flagship during the Battle of Patitite Pattuna, and was able to escape the cruiser before it exploded."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
