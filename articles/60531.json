Brant did not like his posting on Spintir, nor the way the wealthy citizens in the city of Reles tried to be sophisticated. While a low-ranking member of the ISB, he bluffed and coerced his way to more power, as no one in Reles dared question the ISB. If Brant discovered a heist of the governor's collection, or a Force-sensitive, he would use it to his advantage, and attempt to get a promotion out of it. He did not usually carry a weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Heder Brant appears in Fantasy Flight Games' 2015 downloadable roleplaying game adventure Lure of the Lost.
