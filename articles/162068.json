Voting sponsors had to contribute an initial investment of over fifty quadrillion credits, and provide equipment, vehicles, and technical systems for the Authority. Half of the investment was as a direct gift of credits or facilities, and half was a combination of stock and bonds. Voting sponsors were entitled to have a member of the company serve as a Direx on the Executive Directorship Board.
