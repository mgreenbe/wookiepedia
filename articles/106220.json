After escaping Naboo with Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala and reaching Coruscant, Jinn came before the Jedi Council and described a lightsaber duel he had on Tatooine with a Zabrak, whom Jinn believed to be a Sith. Jinn also presented Anakin Skywalker, a young slave he had freed on Tatooine, before the Jedi Council, stating that he believed him to be the Chosen One. The boy had a high midi-chlorian count and a good grasp on the Force, but Koon, along with the rest of Council, was skeptical about the return of the Sith and denied Jinn's wishes to train Skywalker as a Jedi, due to his age.

The Jedi were then forced to stop firing on the Malevolence when it captured the vessel of Naboo Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala. Kenobi and Skywalker departed the bridge to launch a rescue mission, and Koon noted to Tano that her master always seemed to crave such adventure and excitement. Koon then contacted Unduli, who informed him that she was on her way to join them and would be ready to aid in the Malevolence's destruction once the senator had been rescued.

Inside, Plo Koon discovered the lightsaber of Sifo-Dyas. He order his men to clear the area and take all of the wreckage back to Coruscant. He contacted the Jedi Council and informed them of his findings. The Council discussed Sifo-Dyas' role in the formation of the clone army, with Plo Koon noting that prior to the Clone Wars, Sifo-Dyas had claimed to have seen a great war coming which would require the Republic to have an army. Following this meeting, Plo Koon holographically attended a briefing by Master Jocasta Nu as she explained how Sifo-Dyas had perished on Felucia while trying to negotiate a peace treaty between two tribes. Plo Koon inquired about what had become of his body, but Nu informed him that she did not know, as information about the mission had been sealed by the Office of the Supreme Chancellor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Plo Koon then returned to Coruscant, where he met with Yoda, Obi-Wan, and Anakin. The four Jedi discussed new evidence related to the mysterious presence of a second Jedi on Felucia and the missing Silman, a aide to former Chancellor Valorum who had accompanied Sifo-Dyas on a mission to meet with the leaders of the Pyke Syndicate. Plo Koon noted that the Pyke's headquarters was located on Oba Diah, which the moon where he had found Sifo-Dyas's ship and lightsaber orbited. Obi-Wan and Anakin were dispatched to Oba Diah, where they discovered that Silman was still alive as a prisoner of the Pykes, but he was murdered by Count Dooku before he could tell them much. They did learn that Count Dooku was Darth Tyranus, and that he had been responsible for the creation of the clone army.

He and the other Council members in attendance, along with Anakin Skywalker, watched in dismay as Count Dooku ordered his fleet to open fire on the refugee convoy, killing Chubor and the thousands of innocent civilians aboard his ships, while droid forces on Mahranee were ordered to exterminate any remaining Mahran. Dooku claimed that the responsibility for the tragedy rested with the Jedi for continuing to resist his cause and supporting the Republic. The Council lamented that the Jedi were stretched too thin to adequately defend every world under threat of Separatist invasion. Koon bemoaned that they could barely count the number of dead from the war, but that the near-extinction of the Mahran was one of the greatest tragedies yet. Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi placed the blame for all the deaths in the war on Dooku, but Koon noted that they were using the same words that Dooku had in pinning the blame for the deaths on the Jedi. Windu then wondered if perhaps they did earn some of the blame by not doing all they could to end the war, and proposed assassinating Dooku. While Kenobi was against at the idea and Yoda was reluctant, Koon and the rest of the Council members eventually agreed that they should send a Jedi to assassinate the former Jedi Master turned Sith Lord. The Council decided to send Jedi Master Quinlan Vos to carry out the mission with the aid of Dooku's former apprentice Asajj Ventress."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A few months into the mission, Vos ceased reporting to Kenobi after claiming that he had won Ventress' trust and aid in the attempt to kill Dooku. Koon speculated that Ventress may have discovered that Vos was a Jedi and killed him for deceiving her, but Kenobi did not think that was likely, as Ventress would have made sure the Jedi Order would know of her anger over such an action. Ventress eventually contacted Kenobi and informed him that she and Vos had failed to kill Dooku and that Vos had been captured and turned to the dark side. Over the next several months, Vos emerged as Admiral Enigma and led Separatist forces to victory in several battles. As Koon and several other Council members met to determine what to do about Vos, they were surprised when Kenobi, Skywalker, and Jedi Knight Akar-Deshu brought Ventress into the Council chamber. Koon reached for his lightsaber, but Kenobi informed the Council that he had promised Ventress safe passage into the Temple and that she was there to aid them in finding and defeating Vos. Koon was skeptical that she was telling the truth, but Kenobi convinced them to listen to her. Ventress admitted she had taught Vos to use the dark side and that the two of them had become lovers. The Council dismissed Ventress and the knights to discuss Ventress offer, and Kenobi suggested that they could capture and redeem Vos.

Koon and several other Council members met to determine if Vos could be returned to duty. Kenobi reported that he believed Vos was ready, although Koon wondered if Dooku could have broken him, noting that a former Jedi Master under Dooku's influence would be a great threat to the Jedi Order. Kenobi reassured them that he was satisfied by Vos' account of his time with Dooku, which Koon and the rest of the Council, with the exception of Windu, accepted. They decided to utilize the knowledge of Separatist operations Vos had gained during his captivity, and dispatched Kenobi, Vos, Skywalker, and Desh to capture a Separatist supply storage base. They successfully destroyed the forces defending the base, but had to abandon it after Vos discovered the asteroid in which the base was located was rigged with explosives.

Windu suggested that they execute him for his betrayal of the Order and the extreme risk of attempting to imprison a fallen Jedi Master, which Koon and Ki-Adi-Mundi supported. Kenobi instead convinced them to test Vos by sending him once again to kill Dooku and hope that he would take this opportunity to reject the dark side. Vos accepted the mission, not knowing of the Council's plan to have Obi-Wan and Anakin shadow him with a task force that included Desh and Jedi Knight Kav Bayons, and Vos once again recruited Ventress to aid him in assassinating Dooku at the Second battle of Christophsis. The mission ended with the death of Desh and Bayons at the hands of Dooku and Vos, who had indeed fallen to the dark side in an attempt to learn the identity of Darth Sidious, Dooku's Sith Master. Ventress was also killed by Dooku by Force lightning, but her death caused Vos to reject the dark side and submit to capture by Kenobi and Skywalker, who returned him to the Jedi Temple, where he admitted all his crimes before the Jedi Council and submitted himself to them for judgment. The Council allowed Vos to work alongside Yoda to redeem himself, and eventually Koon and the others gained enough trust in Vos to place him in Kenobi's care and allow him to return Ventress' body to her homeworld of Dathomir."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Death"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around the time of the Battle of Yerbana, Plo Koon had been dispatched to Cato Neimoidia.
