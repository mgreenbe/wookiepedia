During the Clone Wars, 2242 was known by the nickname \"Cooker\" for being able to consistently hit the power cells of Confederate battle droids, resulting in the combustion of the droids. Around 21 BBY, Geonosian forces invaded the planet Rishi and\u2014in order to get the mineral needed to power their sonic weapons\u2014took control of the exonium mines on the planet. The unit to which Cooker belonged, Green Company, was dispatched to protect the native Rishii and was ordered not to attack until a Jedi General arrived. However, Rishii Chieftain Gwarrk ordered the clone troopers to assail the mines, because his people needed the exonium to prepare their food when the ground began to frost."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clones' attack was unsuccessful due to the Geonosians' better position, and soon a retreat was ordered by Jedi Master Kit Fisto, who had just arrived on Rishi. Fisto then developed a plan to defeat the Geonosians and ordered Green Company's clone commander to provide him with his best sharpshooter; the commander chose Cooker for the task. After inquiring after Cooker's nickname, Fisto approved the appointment. The Jedi then went to the entrance of the mines, and Cooker, positioned on a ledge opposite the entrance, told Fisto that he could not help him, because he had no line of sight to the well-entrenched enemy from his position."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fisto answered that Cooker was supposed to target the Jedi himself and fire continuously at his shoulder. Cooker was shocked and told Fisto that he could not shoot at him, but the Jedi explained to him that he would deflect Cooker's blaster shots with his lightsaber at the Geonosians, since he couldn't deflect their sonic weapons. When the Geonosians began to attack the Jedi, Fisto ordered Cooker to open fire. Cooker complied, and with their combined efforts, all of the enemy troops in the canyon were soon killed by the deflected shots."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fisto then noticed the massive doors of the mines opening and hoped that this meant a surrender of the Confederate forces. This proved not to be the case, as the Geonosians revealed an LR1K sonic cannon and attacked Fisto with it, knocking him to the ground. At that moment, Cooker contacted Fisto via comlink and told the Jedi to stay down. Demonstrating his sniping skills, Cooker fired a single shot directly down the barrel of the Confederate weapon, destroying the cannon. The rest of the Republic forces and the Rishii warriors then attacked the mines, forcing the remaining Geonosians to flee. Afterward, Gwarrk acknowledged that Fisto was very powerful, to which the Jedi replied that two factors had made this victory possible: the power of his mind and Cooker's help."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cooker was considered to be a talented sharpshooter, able to consistently hit power cells of Separatist droids; he mentioned enjoyment at watching the droids subsequently burn.
