In an account of the attack imprinted on a Baragwin sense lattice years later, the soldier characterized the traders on Little Atullus who had sold his parents land as \"hotshots\" and further noted that many on Little Atullus at the time had claimed that a better life awaited potential settlers on \"unspoiled\" worlds beyond the region known by then as the Rim\u2014a sentiment with which the soldier partially agreed with regard to his pastoral life on Okator VIII."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Little Atullus was originally meant to be mentioned in the 2012 reference book The Essential Guide to Warfare by Jason Fry and Paul R.
