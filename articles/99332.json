These craft allowed them to perform seemingly impossible maneuvers, and had special high-output solar panels installed to boost weapons strength. The pilots of Obsidian Squadron were also led by Civ\u00e9 Rashon. They were stationed aboard the Star Destroyer Avenger and tasked with pursuing the Millennium Falcon, first as it entered the Hoth asteroid field, and again later as it escaped from Bespin's Cloud City. They were then stationed at Bespin as part of the permanent garrison there. During the construction of the second Death Star near Endor, Obsidian Squadron was called in to help defend the space station, being assigned aboard the Star Destroyer Thunderflare."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notable Members"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
