The lab was at one stage used to produce a series of prototype blaster pistols which were relatively high-powered for their class of weapon. However, shortly after the weapons were completed, the lab was broken into and the prototypes taken by the Human female Devidia Vennsiol and her boyfriend Dorbus Kyrullus. The pair escaped with the pistols, but Kyrullus was later caught with the majority of them and they were returned. To regain the remaining two pistols which Vennsiol possessed, Safidine placed a bounty on her head."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The laboratory was created as part of the \"Bounties to Die For\" article in the sixth issue of Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Gamer magazine series. The magazines were supplements for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game and the lab was included in an entry for Devidia Vennsiol which was written by S. Mitch Ritchie. The article states only that the bounties are posted by the Empire but does not give a specific era in which they are set."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
