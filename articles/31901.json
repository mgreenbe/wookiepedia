Under ideal conditions, the result might have been a single crystal, where all of the atoms in the solid fit into the same crystal structure. However, many crystals generally formed simultaneously during solidification, leading to a polycrystalline solid. Most metals encountered were polycrystals. Crystals were often symmetrically intergrown to form crystal twins."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many types of crystals were known to exist. Examples include memory crystals, such as the Kyber memory crystal used by the Jedi Order to locate Force-sensitive children, and lightsaber crystals used by the Jedi and Sith in the construction of lightsabers. Lightsaber crystals focused a blade's energy, augmented its properties and, in the case of crystals like the Kaiburr crystal, could greatly enhance the weapon's power. Crystals could be found on worlds such as Ilum and Dantooine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
