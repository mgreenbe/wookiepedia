The ground of the spaceport was wet sand rather than permacrete, and the buildings were made of stone. Predominantly white, the buildings were covered in mold and dirt. In 8 ABY, the spaceport was constantly besieged by desperate civilians trying to get off-world. They were treated badly by the Pembric Security Legion, who often used violence to quell their protests. It was under the control of Erwithat Space Control. It contained Landing Pad 28 and Pad 642."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
