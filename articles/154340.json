He was a member of the Church of the Dark Side, a mock religion established by the Imperial Intelligence following the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY. He wore a full beard and used spectacles. When the pseudo-Kadann welcomed Zorba the Hutt aboard Scardia Station, the members of the Church honored him with a banquet held in their most formal dining hall.
