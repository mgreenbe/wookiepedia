Amidst the smoke from a blazing pyre, the Jedi called upon his fellow Jedi in the crowd to avenge their betrayed brother and sister Jedi and reclaim the Temple. When no other being joined him, he raced up the stairs, lightsaber ablaze and killing one stormtrooper, only to be shot down by members of the 501st Legion still guarding the Temple.
