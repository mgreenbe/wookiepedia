Torra isn't impressed by Kaz's pre-throw bragging, but all three darts hit close to the center of the board, with one almost being a bulls-eye. Bucket isn't impressed by this, and after Kaz is done, he takes off his helmet to collect the darts. To Torra's surprise, the astromech droid decides to go next. Neeku decides to hide behind Torra, but Bucket's first two shots, surprisingly, are bulls-eyes. Kaz laughs when Bucket's third shot goes wide, but the dart ricochets off of several objects, including a tray held up by Aunt Z, to strike Kaz in the buttocks. He then chases after Bucket as the droid flees the tavern."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
