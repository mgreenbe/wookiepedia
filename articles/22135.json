When R2-D2 entered the food line to secure meals for Anakin Skywalker and Padm\u00e9 Amidala, who were traveling from Coruscant to Naboo incognito, COO-2180 told the astromech off for getting in line in place of his owners, but it was too late. Artoo had already gotten food for the pair and answered the cook droid's invective with some of his own."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "COO-2180 was manufactured by Publictechnic.
