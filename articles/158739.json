After the freighter passed inspection, Juhm questioned the operators of the irradiator why there was one extra ship in the convoy. As the freighter entered the atmosphere of Gwori, the convoy was ordered to change course, and Artoo could not adjust, thus pointing out the impostor. Artoo ejected the carbonite blocks and itself into the sands below just before the ship was destroyed by droid fighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
