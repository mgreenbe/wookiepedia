After finding your third Star Map (just before you get abducted by the Leviathan), return to the Ebon Hawk and set your destination to Dantooine. You will then get abducted by the Leviathan. Complete the Leviathan mission as normal. You will return to the destination you chose just before getting abducted by the Leviathan (which should be Dantooine). Upon returning to the Ebon Hawk's cockpit, you must then set your destination to the planet you had finished just before getting abducted by the Leviathan (i.e. the third planet you have completed). Be sure not to leave the Ebon Hawk at this time. Upon arrival, you will see everyone standing in the middle of the ship. Go to the cockpit once more and you will see the Galaxy Droid. The odd \"Swoop Droid\" will also be on your ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droid will instantaneously transport you to any planet in the game of your choosing, Manaan, Kashyyyk, Korriban, Tatooine, Dantooine, Unknown world, the Star Forge, the Leviathan, the Endar Spire, and Taris. If the player chooses the Star Forge, the Endar Spire, or the Leviathan, the game will crash. If Taris is chosen, there is no way off-planet (the planet starts all over again which sees you back in the abandoned apartment). If the player chooses the Unknown World, the player is probably not powerful enough to survive. Any other planet will be normal. As soon as the player leaves the Ebon Hawk, the Galaxy Droid will disappear from the game altogether."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
