It was the model used by the Galactic Empire to protect the construction of the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station over the forest moon of Endor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The generator featured a base with a self-contained power station underneath the focusing dish, with the power station's power core being both efficient and sustainable by necessity. A large, concentric dish enabled large objects in space to be shielded, while eight smaller shield projectors lined the dishes edges, helping deliver an energy shield to protect an object in space. A large 'spike' emerged from the center of the focusing dish, which was in reality a positioning emitter antenna designed to help align the shield."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The shield also aided in keeping the Death Star II in a stationary orbit around Endor, causing massive geological disturbances."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
