He then ordered his flagship's gunners to open fire on the other New Republic vessels, not enough to cause heavy damage but to persuade the enemy computers that his vessel was one of them. The automated Star Destroyers circled around Antilles's flagship in a protective position, and he disabled them with precise turbolaser hits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Here, Luke Skywalker engaged in a duel with Kueller. Luke had been previously injured by Kueller when he touched down on the planet. With the aid of a native animal, a thernbee, Luke escaped Kueller. When Leia Organa Solo came to rescue him, Kueller confronted them, intent on killing them both. Luke attacked, but in his weakened state, Kueller pushed him back, feeding off his anger to become more powerful. Leia fired blaster shots at Kueller, but he deflected them. Skywalker realized that prolonging the duel was only making Kueller stronger and prepared to sacrifice himself as his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi had done, and then guide Leia to defeat Kueller. However, at that point, Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Mara Jade arrived with ysalamiri, which repelled the Force. Caught in the Force-empty bubble, Kueller was momentarily stunned. Feeling that he needed more power, Kueller prepared to activate a series of detonator-rigged droids around the galaxy and to draw on the power of the disturbance in the Force that the thousands of deaths caused by the explosions would generate. However, before he could do so, Leia Organa Solo shot and killed him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
