Sallis worked as a crewman on the comet broom ship, a starship that destroyed or diverted the courses of rogue comets in the Cularin system, and she was also a good friend of the Human Selima DeWitt. In about 31 BBY, DeWitt moved to the city of Gadrin without informing her father, Davin DeWitt, who subsequently hired a group of freelance agents to find his daughter. Sallis was present in the platform city Bayonard during the agents' investigation and after hearing that the party were looking for DeWitt, she informed them of her friend's location."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
