All the while he wallows and writhes in the dark side's embrace, shaping the very fate of the galaxy. A similar but enormous worm-like creature bursts from the holocron and devours Sidious. The ritual ends abruptly with the Sith Lord reducing the worm to dust, and he emerges from his chamber and goes through a procession of Red Guards, giving off the calm and friendly image of the Chancellor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thompson's experience behind the development curtain gave him a unique outlook on the Star Wars universe, which he applied to his Visionaries assignment.
