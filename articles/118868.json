It was lightweight, featuring a dart-like fuselage with a two-person cockpit and polarized bubble canopy. It also featured short wings and a single IN-780 supercharged ion turbofan engine with vectoring thrust nozzles. The engine was supported by altitude thrusters, and could reach speeds comparable to a TIE/LN starfighter. The airspeeders were custom-built for their owners, making them extremely rare and considerably expensive, and were primarily sold only in the Core Worlds. The craft sacrificed comfort and safety for speed and handling. The militarized SU-42RS Flashblind was built around the baseline SU-40 model."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The SU-40 was created for Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars: Age of Rebellion roleplaying game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
