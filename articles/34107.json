Many of the Acolytes were themselves former Jedi, having defected to the CIS due to their frustrations with the corrupt Galactic Republic. Some joined out of personal loyalty to Dooku himself, though others joined out of a misguided fascination with either the dark side of the Force or Sith lore, both of which the organization championed. However, some members of the Acolytes had been directly approached by Dooku, and in the case of Force-sensitives who had no prior training, were tutored by Dooku himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Entry into the Dark Acolytes appeared to be relatively easy, with most capable Force-wielders being accepted without argument. However, such recruits typically remained minor players within the group until they gained Dooku's trust, either through displays of loyalty or on occasion, the rage-fueled depravity indicative of the dark side of the Force. Once this was gained, Acolytes were provided with more important assignments and sometimes Sith training. While not true Sith in their own right, and therefore not a violation of the Sith Rule of Two, certain members of the acolytes were provided with tutoring in certain elements of Sith knowledge and philosophy. A notable example is Asajj Ventress, who was trained in the Sith Quey'tek meditation."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the organization served at the whim of the Order of the Sith Lords and adhered strongly to Sith philosophy, many of the types of equipment made available to members were of Sith-design. Most notably were the Sith Enforcer battle tanks. Each of these craft were armed with a pair of supercharged blaster cannons and two missile launchers. Though effective in one-on-one attacks, Dooku insisted that they travel in groups of three for improved effectiveness. All members of the organization were provided with red synth-crystals for their lightsabers, and most wielded these proudly. Notably, Quinlan Vos was provided with the crystal originally used by Darth Andeddu. However, some members chose to continue to use the Ilum crystals they carried as Jedi, particularly if they were operating as infiltrators and spies within the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Beyond these standards, the equipment and weapons used was left to their personal discretion, due to the various roles they performed within the CIS military. Those who publicly displayed themselves on the battlefield, such as Savage Opress or Tol Skorr, typically opted for some type of armor. Asajj Ventress, who usually worked as an assassin or covert operative, favored variations on a Sullustan Leather jumpsuits and long combat skirts. Sora Bulq, uniquely, continued to favor his original Jedi robes, even after being ousted as a Dark Acolyte, and only chose to distinguish himself by adopting the standard red lightsabers."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Ideology"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Dark Acolytes had little in the way of formalized ideology or philosophical teachings, and was for the most part motivated by a simple opposition to the Jedi and their teachings. Overall, the Dark Acolytes desired the overthrow of the Galactic Republic, with many of the former Jedi members especially being frustrated with its bureaucracy and greed. Quinlan Vos cited that since this desire was rooted in their disgust with the Republic's corruption rather than a thirst for power, they were still acting in accordance with Jedi teachings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the organization was strongly influenced by Sith philosophy, and was deeply rooted in the dark side of the Force due to this. Dooku cited during his meeting with Yoda on Vjun that since all beings carried the dark side within themselves, turning to it was simply to acknowledge another part of one's self, and was not in itself inherently evil. In a separate exchange with Quinlan Vos, Dooku stated that the Jedi's refusal to use the dark side was motivated by fear of it, and if the Jedi simply stopped fearing it, they could use it to correct the injustices of the galaxy. However, as Dooku was a full Sith Lord at the time, his beliefs cannot be taken to represent the attitudes of the Dark Acolytes as a whole. In fact, many members of the organization were capable of partaking in spectacular displays of depravity with only the flimsiest of justifications. Nikkos Tyris, notably, was of the opinion that the attainment of strength and power eliminated the need for any justification at all; a Sith ideal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Members"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Artel Darc"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Artel Darc commanded the CIS forces on Dagu, where he enslaved the Rybet inhabitants.

Dooku complimented her skills with Force concealment, though he stated that he hadn't come looking for a spy. Ventress leapt into the Cauldron and displayed her combat prowess against the myriad of gladiators, killing all. Dooku was impressed by the display, but Ventress then overstepped her bounds when she declared herself a Sith. The amused Count levitated down to the arena floor and stated that while Ventress fought like a Sith and displayed their trappings, she was still awash in fear, a trait that a true Sith lacked. Ventress moved to attack Dooku, but the Count subdued her with a blast of Force lightning. Ventress awoke within a large penthouse loft carved out of the local rock formations, presumably Dooku's residence on Rattatak. She was swiftly attacked by Dooku just after locating her lightsabers, and the two fought back and forth across the chamber. While Ventress impressed Dooku and Darth Sidious, observing via holocom, with her lightsaber skills, she was ultimately subdued, her lightsabers destroyed. Expecting execution, Ventress was instead recruited into the CIS military, and given a pair of curved-hilt lightsabers to replace her Jedi weapons.

Tann first took control of the Kaer Orbital Platform, an abandoned InterGalactic Banking Clan installation that contained a wealth of raw materials. While battling against the Republic forces led by Jor Drakas, Tann had a considerable number of battle droids constructed on-site. Once she attained an adequate number of troops, she retreated. Most of the army was sent to Raxus Prime for eventual use in the invasion and subsequent defense of Sarapin, while Tann traveled to Tatooine to meet with Boorka the Hutt, a member of the Hutt Cartel.

Fighting her way through the defenses of Asteroid 426 to neutralize the defense grid protecting Sarapin, Tann led the invasion of the world, utilizing the Decimators to great effect. Jedi Knight Jor Drakas was one of the casualties of the Separatist invasion, slain in single combat with Tann.

Windu's revelation forced Bulq to change his plans; instead of making Windu look the aggressor against the dissidents to start a schism, Bulq would kill Windu and the other Jedi and pin the murders on the dead Windu. Both duelists drew their lightsabers and engaged one another. As they battled, they sensed the disturbance caused by the other Jedi's duel with Ventress, so Windu broke off to go rescue them, subduing Bulq with a Force push.
