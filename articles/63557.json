The cause of the war is unknown but it tore through Hutt Space, leaving the Hutt homeworld of Varl and other ancient Hutt colonies lifeless wastes. The Hutts established a Council of Elders to prevent clan rivalries from erupting into open warfare and instituted a new philosophy, called the kajidic, which taught that fierce competition between the clans was how the weak were winnowed from the species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was a philosophy that rejected outright war and territorial conquest as methods used by lesser species. Instead of deploying their slave armies to conquer the Humans as before, the Hutt would rule humanity from within, in favor of enslavement of minor species. The Hutt relocated to Evocar, which they renamed Nal Hutta, where the Council of Elders was established to represent the Hutt clans. Its decisions bound any Hutt that claimed clan rights, thereby preventing any inter-Hutt rivalries from becoming too destructive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
