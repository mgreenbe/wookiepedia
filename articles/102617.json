The PX-4 was capable of locking onto targets at an extreme range and dealing massive damage to enemy starships, as it ripped through both shields and armor. The torpedo's drawbacks included a narrow lock-on targeting cone, a lengthy lock-on period, and a limited ammunition capacity for its launcher."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
