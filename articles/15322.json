On the battlefields of multiple worlds in the Mid Rim, legions of ruthless stormtroopers\u2013bent on crushing resistance to the Empire wherever it arises\u2013are waging close and brutal combat against an armada of freedom fighters. In the streets and alleys of ravaged cities, the front-line forces of the Rebel Alliance are taking the fight to the enemy, pushing deeper into Imperial territory and grappling with the savage flesh-and-blood realities of war on the ground."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leading the charge are the soldiers\u2013men and women, human and nonhuman\u2013of the Sixty-First Mobile Infantry, better known as Twilight Company. Hard-bitten, war-weary, and ferociously loyal to one another, the members of this renegade outfit doggedly survive where others perish, and defiance is their most powerful weapon against the deadliest odds. When orders come down for the Rebels to fall back in the face of superior opposition numbers and firepower, Twilight reluctantly complies. Then an unlikely ally radically changes the strategic equation\u2013and gives the Alliance's hardest-fighting warriors a crucial chance to turn retreat into resurgence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Orders or not, alone and outgunned but unbowed, Twilight Company locks, loads, and prepares to make its boldest maneuver\u2013trading down-and-dirty battle in the trenches for a game-changing strike at the ultimate target: the very heart of the Empire's military machine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Plot summary"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "13 years after the end of the Clone Wars, on the planet Crucival, we meet a young man named Donin as he is participating in his very first battle as a member of one of the planet's belligerent clans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "9 years later, we find ourselves on the planet Haidoral Prime. Here we are introduced to Twilight Company, also known as the Alliance 61st Mobile Infantry.

They have been on Haidoral Prime for 18 months, and the fighting on the planet is winding down."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A tradition of the unit is to organize recruitment events where locals can come and join the company in an effort to replace their losses.

They interview the governor, whose name we find out is Everi Chalis, and in exchange for the protection of Twilight Company, she offers up her vast knowledge of Imperial logistics. She claims to have a vast working knowledge of the Empire's supply system, as she was trained by Count Denetrius Vidian himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the meantime, Namir makes his rounds of the new recruits or \"fresh meat\" that opted to join the company.

As the ship is being hammered by Imperials, Namir realizes the governor is locked away in an airlock that is being used as a makeshift brig. As he makes his way there, the ship takes a bad hit.

They are to land on the planet Coyerti, a polluted world known for the Imperial's manufacturing of chemical weapons and other poisons. Once here, they are to defend the local indigenous population from the Empire as they are supporters of the Rebellion and unable to protect themselves during their short mating season. Despite most of the company becoming partially poisoned and a battle with an AT-ST, they succeed and return to the Thunderstrike. Namir finds Roach hiding in a cargo bay. He assumes she is suffering from some form of post-traumatic stress given that this was her first true combat mission. It turns out she is a recovering spice addict and is going through withdrawal. He sits with her through the night."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Thunderstrike continues to be harassed by the Imperials. It is believed this is due to the presence of the governor. Despite this, her debriefing continues. She promises to deliver an immensely detailed mapping of the Imperial supply network. Twilight assaults a convoy of Imperial transports.

It is decided that the best course of action is for her to meet with Alliance High Command."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the wake of the transport assault, a funeral is held to mourn the loss of Twilight soldiers in that operation. After this funeral, Governor Chalis and Namir have another conversation about his position in the galaxy and the planet he came from. It turns out Namir is the kid we have been following back on Crucival in our flashbacks to the past. The governor commiserates with Namir, as she also came from a backwater world.

While they are there, the Empire begins its attack on Echo Base and begins the battle of Hoth. Namir joins the ground battle.

Namir finds Chalis dragging the Captain who has a severe head injury and is unconscious. Instead of taking her seat on the first transport scheduled to leave the base in the event of an attack, Chalis has stayed to make sure that Captain Evon could escape the base. They find out Vader's shuttle has landed. The governor becomes afraid as she is convinced the entire Imperial raid has happened to capture her. It turns out she is wrong. Namir's group encounters Vader and he defeats them easily. He is about the kill the governor, asking her where Skywalker is, but before he can finish, he hears that his troops have located the Millennium Falcon. He force throws the governor against the wall and leaves. This is the last thing that Namir sees before blacking out due to injury."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When he wakes up, Namir finds the governor, both of them are injured but alive.

They set down on a planet to undergo repairs. Namir and the governor return and the company begins to deal with the death of the Captain.

A few days pass and Chalis takes charge, coming up with a plan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The manhunt for the Rebel leadership has spread the Empire's resources thin. This has opened an opportunity to strike at the Core Worlds, specifically, the shipyards at Kuat. She also suggests a series of preparatory raids to pull more ships and troops away from the shipyards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They begin to put the plan into action, with Namir begrudgingly taking temporary command. Over the next few missions, he realizes the best way for him to honor the Captain is to command the company. He continues to be unsure, but Chalis keeps reassuring him and acting as his closest adviser. This relationship also places her in a position of authority within the company."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Captain Tabor Seitaron deciphers the pattern of attacks devised by Chalis. The Imperials prepare quick assault groups for attacks on three worlds, including Sullust, that are most likely to be next in an attempt to catch the company."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The company lands on Sullust and quickly takes the Inyusu Tor mineral processing facility, which is situated on a volcano.

This will be the last stop before the final assault on Kuat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Thunderstrike attempts to land on the planet, it is ambushed by the Imperials who have caught up with them again.

He argues with Chalis. He feels that the Empire has now figured out their pattern and can predict they will be striking at Kuat. She is not convinced. She tells him she will take responsibility for long-range planning if he will focus on getting the company off of Sullust. She decides the best course of action is to contact the Sullustan resistance; She, Namir, Roach, and three others make their way into the city of Pinyumb to do so. They met at a safe house which soon falls under attack. Namir is caught in a blast and is knocked out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He comes to and finds himself captured by two stormtroopers, one of which is Thara Nyende.

In an impassioned speech to his former squad, he decides that they should abandon the goal of Kuat and focus instead on helping the resistance on Sullust, a much more noble goal which keeps with the spirit of the Rebellion. They agree in principle, but Gadren, a huge, wise and multi-armed squad member says he would like to get the governor's opinion on this, as they have come to respect her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He goes to tell the governor of his decision and finds her ordering soldiers around directly, taking command of the company.

Her time in command is over."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The company digs in and prepares for the assault. Despite taking losses, they repel the Imperials fairly easily.

As usual, she tries to weasel herself out of her bad situation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It is actually a trap for the imperials. The governor detonates ion-mines on the shuttle, causing a power blip in the ship's propulsion system. Since they are in the atmosphere, the destroyer starts going down."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Verge orders the ship to ram the facility. Tabor disagrees and begins arguing with him. The governor tackles the Prelate and begins fighting him ferociously. Eventually, Captain Tabor pulls his blaster, shoots Verge and orders all power to engines to save his ship and crew.
