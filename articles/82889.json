A large portion of the planet's southern hemisphere was broken, which revealed the vast yellow Sulfur Sea beneath. The planet's northern hemisphere presented a purple hue when viewed from space, with long cracks that resembled vast rivers reaching up into it from where the crust disappeared to the south."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the planet's fragility, the northern hemisphere managed to cling to a thin, yet breathable atmosphere, making it capable of supporting life. However, water on Lola Sayu was scarce, and no indigenous life forms were known to exist on the planet. The planet's remaining terrain was extremely treacherous and unpredictable, primarily consisting of mountains, hills, caves, crevasses, volcanoes and lava flows. Much of the roads wound close to the edge of the lava flows, and would often lead travellers to labyrinth-like cave systems or steep valleys."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During 522 BBY, the Jedi Order built the Citadel somewhere on Lola Sayu in order to imprison rogue Jedi.

During the war, Jedi Master Even Piell was brought to Lola Sayu and imprisoned at the Citadel for vital information he carried. A strike team was sent to rescue him and his fleet officers, but because their ship was destroyed in the attempt to escape, an entire fleet of Republic ships arrived to rescue them and the planet became a site of a large battle. After the end of the clone Wars a Separatist holdout remained on the citadel. The holdout was led by a malfunctioning droid that tried to follow its final directive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
