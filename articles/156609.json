The freighter Legacy Run was travelling along the hyperspace route when it was destroyed in the Great Hyperspace Disaster. At the time of the disaster, around 232 BBY, it was considered an old and well-established hyperlane, which was why Hedda Casset, the captain of the Legacy Run, was surprised to encounter an obstacle in the middle of the route, which should have been impossible. The obstacle was in fact a Nihil Stormship travelling a hyperspace Path, unique routes available only to the pirates. As Ab Dalis was located further down the hyperlane, it was subjected to the first of the Emergences, fallout of the Great Disaster, one day later."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
