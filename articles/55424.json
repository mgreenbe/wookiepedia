Descending into an underworld portal, the speeder bike begins to malfunction, leaving her hanging on for dear life as the vehicle flips over and continues on upside-down. Ahsoka annoys a few other drivers by running on their vehicles as she passes in an attempt to gain momentum, but the bike swings out into the center of the passage and heads toward a collision with a Gozanti-class cruiser. She manages to avert a collision by throttling the bike's accelerator, flipping it over and regaining her seat on it, but knocking off the cruiser's communications dish. Ahsoka takes a moment to catch her breath, thinking the worst is over, but the bike malfunctions again, sending her plummeting into the Coruscant Underworld."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A new friend"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ahsoka manages to regain control in mid-air and crash lands on the edge of a platform.

Trace is a mechanic and offers to fix Tano's bike for a price. Tano prefers to fix her bike but Trace says that the tools will still cost her. Tano says that she does not have enough credits but Trace takes pity on her. Trace takes her into her shipyard which has a Nebula-class freighter that Trace is modifying.

Ahsoka tells Trace that she has to get out of Coruscant. When Trace asks if she is in trouble, Tano questions her decision to leave the Jedi Order before walking away.
