Created by 28 ABY, the asth-korr throat-hold involved vising ones' hands around an opponent's neck. The throat-hold was one of the many unarmed combat moves that Jedi Tahiri Veila knew, as she had been partially shaped by the Yuuzhan Vong in an attempt by their shapers to convert her to the Yuuzhan Vong religion of the True Way. In 29 ABY, during the war, a warrior used the move on former smuggler Han Solo while on the space platform Caluula Station, at the time of a battle between the Yuuzhan Vong and the Galactic Alliance at the planet Caluula."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The asth-korr attack first appeared in Force Heretic III: Reunion, a 2003 New Jedi Order installment written by Shane Dix and Sean Williams. 2003's The Unifying Force, which was written by James Luceno as a part of the series, featured the throat-hold as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
