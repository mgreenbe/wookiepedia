It was later discovered that at least some of these ships had been seized by the native Yevetha of the Duskhan League during the Imperial withdrawal in 4 ABY, and they too had continued to use the name \"Black Fleet\" for their new navy as they augmented their prizes with new ships built to Imperial designs, and their own thrustships. It is not known how many ships were originally assigned to Black Sword Command. Intelligence recovered from the wreck of the Gnisnal in 16 ABY, however, revealed that forty-four capital ships had disappeared from Black Sword after Endor, consisting of five front-line Star Destroyers and thirty-nine other ships undergoing construction or repair. None of these was smaller than a 900m Victory-class ship, and they included three Super Star Destroyers. To this total should also be added five Type II Orbital Repair Yards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Yevetha were known to have captured the Black Fifteen shipyard, which orbited their homeworld at N'zoth, and with it nine Star Destroyers in various states of repair and construction, and a large number of Imperial prisoners, whom the Yevetha held in a camp on Pa'aal. Another yard, Black Nine, was later put back into commission by the Duskhan League at Prildaz, where it was destroyed in the Battle of ILC-905. The Black Fleet contained sixty or so capital ships of Imperial design by the time of the Great Purge. More Star Destroyers were under construction at Black Nine when the shipyard was destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the last stages of the Black Fleet Crisis in 17 ABY, the surviving Imperial captives staged a daring counter-coup. Led by Major Sil Sorannan, they seized control of every Imperial ship in the Duskhan League's fleet. Following their initial orders, what Sorannan dubbed the \"Camp Pa'al Squadron\" withdrew immediately to Byss, but there they diverged. The bulk of the Imperial crews surrendered their ships to the New Republic, but four Victory-class Star Destroyers joined the forces of Admiral Daala in the Deep Core, while two Star Destroyers and the EX-F allied themselves with Admiral Gilad Pellaeon and the Imperial Remnant in the Outer Rim. Intimidator herself disappeared into the Unknown Regions, and was later found adrift as a wreck. The Aramadia was apparently scuttled in the Deep Core and later brought back to N'zoth, to be used as a museum."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known force composition"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Super Star Destroyers"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Imperial-class Star Destroyers"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Victory-class Star Destroyers"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Other capital ships"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yevethan designs"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shipyards"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Starfighters"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
