There, he joined a community of droids who had been discarded by their owners including several B2-series super battle droids, dwarf spider droids, and mouse droids. Due to his experiences with sentient beings, N-3RO harbored a hatred for most sentient beings with the exception of the former Sith clone Jek-14, who could use the Force to create beautiful double helix structures out of junk. Jek-14 was known as the Maker of Zoh and came to be regarded as the natural leader of the droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Battle of Hoth, a family of scavengers known as the Freemakers arrived on Zoh. Upon landing, N-3RO and a part of droids greeted the Human strangers and their modified B1-series battle droid Roger. Roger tried to convince N-3RO and his companions that the Freemakers did not pose a threat. However, N-3RO disagreed after learning that Roger's transmission pack had been removed by his owners. A brief fight broke out between the droids and the Freemakers but was broken up by Jek-14."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jek-14 was convinced of the Freemakers' peaceful intentions and allowed them to harvest scrap material. He also set his mouse droid Fixer to repairing N-3RO and the other damaged droids. Jek-14 also agreed to train the Force-sensitive Rowan Freemaker in the ways of the Force. Despite Jek's assurances, N-3RO still despised the strangers and regarded them as a corrupting influence on the Maker.

N-3RO treated Roger to an oil bath in order to prevent the battle droid from interfering in his plans to eliminate the Freemakers. While Roger was relaxing, N-3RO gave BL-OX orders to proceed with his plan. Under N-3RO's direction, BL-OX lured Kordi and Zander into a trap. Before the droids could finish them off, Rowan and Jek arrived on their improvised speeders. Jek tried to reason with the droids but N-3RO had succeeded in convincing them that the Freemakers were a threat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Maker refused to support N-3RO's actions, the droids turned on Rowan and N-3RO. After recapturing the humans, N-3RO and the droids prepared to \"deactivate\" them; having deemed the Maker irredeemable. Before they could terminate their prisoners, Roger turned up and defended his masters. He pointed out that despite his disagreements with the Freemakers he still regarded them as family. When N-3RO asked whether Roger was siding with the humans over his droid brethren, Roger replied that he was both a droid and a Freemaker. Roger then reattached his transmission pack, which alerted Naare and Graballa to their position."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At first nothing happened and Roger suggested negotiations. However, N-3RO ordered the droids to terminate him and the humans. Before they could carry out their sentence, Naare's starship Eclipse Fighter and Graballa's starship Rancor's Fist arrived. Despite N-3RO's threats, the droid was blasted aside by the Rancor's Fist. The Freemakers and Roger managed to escape while Jek-14 made an apparent last stand against Naare, who was a Sith agent of Darth Sidious and Darth Vader. N-3RO survived the battle only to find that he had been fitted with a restraining bolt. BL-0X confronted N-3RO and told them that the droids should not have listened to him and blamed him for killing the Maker.

He respected Jek-14, the former Sith clone who had become the Maker of Zoh. N-3RO was adept at manipulating the other droids into turning against the visiting Freemakers. N-3RO believed that the Freemakers were corrupting the Maker and that the droids would be discarded a second time. In order to prevent that, he was willing to kill the Freemakers. When the Maker proved unwilling to support N-3RO's actions, he turned the other droids against Jek-14 as well.
