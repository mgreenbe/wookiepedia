The beam emitted from the components near the stock energized the quarrel. The twin polarizers would then magnetically accelerate the energized quarrel out of the bow. The quarrel would ultimately explode upon impact with a target. It resembled an elongated laser bolt when fired because it was wrapped in an energy envelope that channeled the quarrel's explosive force into the target."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
