The starfighter wing from Chadawa, however, soon arrived to intervene.

Once Colonel Soran Keize\u2014the 204th's commanding officer\u2014arrived, the ordnance specialist advised Quell through an intercom to stand back and the cell opened for the colonel to speak to the deserter, who wished to rejoin the 204th."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Fighting at Chadawa"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later that year, the 204th was working with a larger group of the Empire. Under orders by Grand Moff Randd, the fighter wing carried out a string of genocides on worlds that had parted from the Empire. By around this time, Gandor flew as an Imperial Starfighter Pilot for the unit. During the units mission, however, it was pursued by Syndulla's forces through a number of star systems. At the 204th's next target, the planet Chadawa, the fighter wing hid under the worlds defensive mechanical rings after briefly engaging the local Chadawan navy. A starfighter wing deployed from Syndulla's flagship, the refitted Star Destroyer Deliverance and made short attacks on the 204th as its forces worked towards devastating Chadawa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While both parties were at a stalemate, New Republic personnel used a comm channel to speak to the 204th pilots, some being able to get responses. Gandor interacted with Denish Wraive, the leader of the New Republic's Wild Squadron. Although Wraive was reluctant to share names of his comrades, the pair came to sing half a dozen verses of The Khuntavaryan Fall, which they were ultimately not able to finish. The Deliverance's starfighter wing soon engaged the 204th head on, and the fighter wing escaped while the Chadawan navy attacked Syndulla's forces."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Last stand at Jakku"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 204th rendezvoused with a large remaining portion of the Empire at the planet Jakku, which awaited a last stand with the New Republic. Gandor was permitted by Keize to speak with his brother Sliblis, who served aboard the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Ravager. The pair spoke over hologram and wept as they exchanged stories. The New Republic soon launched an attack on the Empire at Jakku. During the battle, the 204th reproduced particle effects that were seen at Chadawa and used the subsequent radiation to sever the communications of enemy starships before swiftly defeating them. The fighter wing, Gandor among the unit used this tactic to destroy the heavy cruisers Brightsaber, Serenade and Hunting Hound."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Syndulla identified the 204th's new method and sent the Deliverance's starfighter wing after the Imperial fighter wing. When the New Republic fighter wing found the 204th, the New Republic pilots Nath Tensent and Chass na Chadic conversed over an open channel. Gandor questioned over the channel whether Chadic was the pilot who flew a A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter, trying to figure out which fighter she was in. After the pilot mentioned Wraive's name, the Wild Squadron leader called Gandor out, taunting him about not finishing the 'Khuntavaryan Fall.' The two wings engaged, each losing fighters in the ensuing engagement. Gandor eventually perished, and his name was called out when both sides began reciting names of their lost comrades over the comm channel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mervais Gandor was a human male. His accent had the impression of a working-class resident of the Core Worlds to Nath Tensent. Gandor also came across as clumsy to Yrica Quell.
