Sentients were buried underground and the location marked with a tombstone, or entombed inside of crypts. A variation of this was space burial\u2014in which the deceased was sealed inside a casket and this casket was then launched into space. An alternative to burial was cremation, or the disposal of remains by burning them, which was another popular method of disposing of the remains of deceased sentients."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sacorrian moon of Sarcophagus was entirely devoted to being a burial ground for the planet. On Coruscant the Senatorial Tombs was the final resting place of many Senators, many of whom were frozen in carbonite and interred in the tombs. Senator Viento was buried in this manner after his assassination in 20 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Space burial was a popular method of disposal, especially for military personnel. Lujayne Forge was one person who was buried in space. Following her death 6.5 years after the Battle of Yavin during an attack on the Rogue Squadron base on Talasea by Imperial stormtroopers, she and the other six sentries who had been killed in the attack were buried in space after a memorial service on board the New Republic ship Reprieve."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Lobot, there were were twenty-two thousand, four hundred eight known cultures which entombed riches with the dead by the time of the Black Fleet Crisis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Cultures"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A number of different cultures practiced burial in varying forms."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Sith"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many of the early Sith Lords were given elaborate burials in the Valley of the Dark Lords on Korriban. Even though the tombs were equipped with traps and other defenses, the tombs were eventually penetrated and most of the artifacts were removed from the tombs. The Sith Lord Ludo Kressh was not buried in the Valley of the Dark Lords, he was buried in a secret tomb inside a large Shyrack cave on Korriban. That tomb was filled with dark side energy, which caused visitors to experience massive hallucinations, which were so vivid that visitors were unable to tell whether they were real or not."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While most of the ancient Sith Lords were buried on Korriban, this was not always the case.
