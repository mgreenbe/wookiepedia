He informs her that he instead decided to go to a card game on Bespin that he 'couldn't miss', and that he reassigned the task to C-3PO."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A group of rowdy Ewoks, regarded by Organa as the most primitive sentients in the New Republic, barges into the computer room in which the two Rebel heroes stand, and Organa panics as the new 'technicians' destroy the computers with their weapons and anti-AT-ST countermeasures, knocking over C-3PO in the process. A furious Organa tells Solo to evict them from the room, and decides that their first priority should instead be finding a Human Resources director to hire technicians, and asks Solo as to who their droid found to fill that role. He meekly explains that earlier, Organa stated that their new personnel needed to be 'strong and uncompromising - someone everyone would respect'. As the new HR director - a rancor, a beast indeed strong and respect-demanding, but ferocious and not even fully sentient - walks into the room behind her, Organa declares her unease."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
