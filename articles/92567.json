The people of Naboo often elected young women, believing they possessed a form of pure, childlike wisdom that the adults lacked. Queens of Naboo included Padm\u00e9 Amidala, who served two terms, the first of which included the Invasion of Naboo; Jamillia, who served shortly before the outbreak of the Clone Wars; Neeyutnee, who served during the war; Apailana, who served during the early days of the Galactic Empire, Daln\u00e9, who served around 3 BBY; and Sosha Soruna, who served around the time following the Battle of Endor. Amidala was preceded by Queen Sanandrassa, who was herself preceded by R\u00e9illata, who served one term before successfully running again to serve a second term after Amidala's tenure. The monarch was aided by the Naboo Royal Advisory Council. The proper form of address for a former queen of Naboo was \"M'Lady.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "List of known rulers of Naboo"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The title of Monarch of Naboo first appeared in the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 2016 reference book Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded states that King Veruna preceded Padm\u00e9 Amidala as monarch of Naboo, with Star Wars: Complete Locations adding that he ruled for 13 years.
