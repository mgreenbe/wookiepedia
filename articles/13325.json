The different variants of battle droids were overcoming these limitations and some, such as droidekas or super battle droids, were much more fearsome opponents. Baktoid Workshops, the original manufacturer of the first battle droids, produced over the years many other models of war droids, even going to work for the Galactic Empire itself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
