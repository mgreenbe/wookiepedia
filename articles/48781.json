It was a massive cavern right after the Jackrab Hole, that encompassed much of the comet's rear quarter. Artificial gravity was not maintained in the Cove and various junk floated freely in every direction, none oriented toward any horizon in particular. Named after Salovan Fische, the Cove also included area known as the Tethers and ended near the Slips, a series of docking facilities that led to the inhabitant part of the comet. The mynocks that inhabited the Cove were constant concern of mechanics and pilots alike."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
