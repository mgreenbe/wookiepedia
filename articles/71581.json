While at the den, he collected wagers, served drinks, and talked with patrons in a somewhat gruff manner, although he ignored those who were not gambling. He also refused to talk about his homeworld Duro or the Core Worlds. Having done a fair amount of traveling and possessing reasonable piloting skills, Jokol was able to talk knowledgeably about astrogation and hyperlanes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jokol was first introduced in Beyond the Rim, an adventure module written by Sterling Hershey in 2013 for the Fantasy Flight Games roleplaying game, Star Wars: Edge of the Empire.
