Despite the fact that some of the former slaves would be a part of the crew, Khzam was not generally known as a slaver, and his identity could remain undiscovered."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Khzam claimed to have extensive knowledge of the Kathol sector due to his time as a free-trader in the area, and have extensive contacts on several planets.

He shot first and then justified his actions later, and always had an alibi ready.
