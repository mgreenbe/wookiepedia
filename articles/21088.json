During the Clone Wars, the architect droid Huyang asked Jedi youngling Gungi what he envisioned his lightsaber to look like. Gungi, through the Force, envisioned his lightsaber to be made of wood. Huyang, knowing that the only wood strong enough would be from a Brylark, retrieved a Brylark wood hilt, which Gungi used for his lightsaber. Huyang also stated that it was a rare choice among hilts, just as Wookiees like Gungi were rare among the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
