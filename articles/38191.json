Its magnetic pulses complicated hyperspatial travel along the nearby route between Endor and Trindello, damaging hyperdrives. The shimmering nebula surrounding the pulsar was known to the Ewoks of Endor as the Gorax King's Heart, after an old legend in which the Ewoks' Golden Sun God imprisoned the Gorax king in the night sky."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
