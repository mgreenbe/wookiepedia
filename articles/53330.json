The organization operated a secret lightsaber shop in Black Spire Outpost on the planet Batuu called Savi's Workshop, which was owned by the Gatherer Savi. In the shop, visitors were given a tour where they could construct their own lightsaber, though the operation had to remain hidden from the local First Order occupiers. Thus, the store was disguised as Savi & Son Salvage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Gatherers appear to guests in Savi's Workshop, a retail location located in the theme park land Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge.
