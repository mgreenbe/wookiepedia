Imperial Knights were in the service of the Emperor for life, and the punishment for leaving the Order or disobeying the Emperor was death. However, there was an exception to this law. Although the Imperial Knights ultimately served the Force through the Emperor, this was only true if he himself served the light side of the Force. If he were ever to turn to the dark side, their duty was to either bring him back to the light or remove him from power. This policy was put into place at the time of the Order's founding, and as such, the Imperial Knights did ultimately owe their allegiance to the Force. According to Master Treis Sinde, the Imperial Knights served the Force by serving an Empire that brought order, with their duty being to the Emperor.

They knew the dangers of falling to the dark side, and believed that the Force could not be used out of anger or selfishness. Managing one's emotions and controlling one's fear in the face of adversity was a paramount aspect of Imperial Knight ideology. The strict mental discipline and obedience to orders that was part of their training made Imperial Knights less susceptible to the strong emotions that would draw students of the Jedi over to the dark side. Despite not drawing on the dark side, the Imperial Knights were said to not strictly follow the light side either, obeying the orders of the Emperor before anything else.

Training could be very harsh, but not cruel, and could often take years, but no student ever failed in their training, as the Emperor demanded and always received success. In training, a student would learn all they needed to know in order to defend the Emperor against all those who would harm him.

Imperial Knights were permitted to take on one apprentice at a time, but only after having mastered their own skills to a sufficient degree.
