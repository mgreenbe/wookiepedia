With the Legions of Lettow crippled after the death of their leader, Xendor, and a crushing defeat on Columus, the Jedi, led by Jedi Master Awdrysta Pina, attacked Lettow in an attempt to finish their opponents off. The Legions, now commanded by Xendor's lover Arden Lyn, knew there was no hope of victory, so they settled for holding the Jedi off until they could escape to refuge beyond the Republic's borders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
