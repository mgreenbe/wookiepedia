Unfortunately, they could not destroy these negative energies. All they could do was imprison them in an underground cavern behind an energy field which blocked the energies. This force screen also slowed or stopped sentients in a negative emotional state. Over time, the imprisoned emotional energies formed an intelligent entity, known as The Darker. Though the Arbrans could have used the force screen to destroy the creature, they refused to do so on the grounds that it was a part of them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime afterward, the Arbrans left their homeworld to begin their civilization anew.
