The TIE Baron was equipped with a hyperdrive due to the First Order equipping its higher-end models with modern technology, and its all-crimson design suggested the pilot's skills far surpassed those of the Special Forces TIE pilots, who flew in ships adorned with a red stripe only."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The TIE Baron was equipped with four solar collector wings and an antenna on the ship's cockpit. The twin ion engines were powered by two ion reactors with pre-charged deuterium power cells, which were capable of achieving an atmospheric speed of 1,250 kph. It was armed with four wingtip L-s9.7 laser cannons and projectile launchers capable of firing ST7 concussion missiles and mag-pulse warheads. It was well-protected with shielding and contained an ejector seat.

Eventually, Dameron and Xiono again met up and launched an mission to the Dassal system, where they found celestial bodies with their cores drilled out. Their presence alerted a spider probe droid, which notified Major Vonreg. Another engagement ensued, although Dameron and Xiono were able to escape once again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the occupation of the Colossus began and a full garrison arrived, Vonreg and his squadron patrolled the surrounding area and were incorporated in the garrison. Vonreg fought in his TIE Baron again when forces loyal to the Resistance and led by Xiono engaged the First Order to liberate themselves.
