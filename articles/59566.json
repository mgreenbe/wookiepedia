Based on the Core World Spira, Taft was part of a two-man Rebel cell that included himself and Seth Cambriel, a wealthy beach-bum. Taft was adept at infiltrating installations in search of military intelligence, and was a security expert. He worked at the Ataria Island spaceport as a clerk in the security offices, which gave him license to carry a blaster. During the Galactic Civil War, a smuggler ferrying goods for the Alliance to a drop point on Spira was forced to drop his cargo in the ocean when security forces discovered him. Taft and Cambriel were responsible for recovering the cargo and hiding in the wreck, a submerged, ancient alien spacecraft that had become a popular tourist diving spot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Harbold Taft was a slim man with mousy features and brown hair.
