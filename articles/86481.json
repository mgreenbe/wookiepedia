They were part of a convoy en route to Petrakis along with sister group Hornet, some stormtrooper transports, Lambda shuttles and two pairs of BFF-1 bulk freighters Ocean and Teve. The convoy was to rendezvous with TIE fighters, but two Rebel B-wings, escorted by a single X-wing arrived to destroy the convoy. The TIE pilots who were struck with fear retreated from the attack without engaging the Rebel fighters.
