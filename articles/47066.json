Farng also served as the leader of the Carbonite Miners' Union. During these times, the Carbonite Guild wielded a heavy amount of influence in the Empress Teta system, and the monarchs of the system, Lord Keto and his sister, Magda Keto, were forced to share their power with the organization. But, in 3997 BBY, a dark side\u2013wielding group known as the Krath, led by royal heirs Satal and Aleema Keto, overthrew the Tetan Monarchy. Under Krath rule, all opposed were persecuted and usually killed in public execution ceremonies. However, not all the inhabitants of the system bowed to their will; a group of local carbonite traders, including Farng, decided to resist the Krath regime. Eventually, Farng was captured and sentenced to be killed in an upcoming Krath public execution. The Krath's preferred method of death was to have their prisoners stand on a Tetan repulsordisk situated high above a Carbonite drilling machine, followed by Aleema Keto frightening their captive with a dark side illusion, causing them to lose their balance and fall into the drilling machine. Farng was to be executed in this manner."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When it was Farng's time to be executed, Aleema Keto offered him one last chance to obey the Krath and save himself, but Farng refused, saying that he would rather die than capitulate to the Krath's rule. With Farng's fate seemingly sealed, the sorceress prepared to kill him. At that moment, an onlooker threw Farng a knife, proclaiming that the Krath regime would die instead. Freeing himself from his shackles, Farng leapt toward Keto, while other members of the resistance revealed themselves and drew their weapons. Farng, knife in hand, nearly reached the Krath ruler. However, Jedi Knight Ulic Qel-Droma, on an undercover mission to infiltrate the Krath and learn their dark secrets, emerged from the crowd and killed the carbonite trader with his lightsaber. With Farng dead, the rest of the mob was subdued by Krath security forces."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Farng was very opposed to the Krath regime and was bold enough to try and assassinate the leader of the organization, Aleema Keto. He was very committed to his beliefs, so much so that he refused to capitulate to the Krath's rule, even on consequence of death. Farng knew how to handle a knife in combat and was agile enough to be able to leap from his Tetan repulsordisk to Aleema Keto's perch several meters away."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Farng first appeared in Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi - Dark Lords of the Sith, a story arc of the Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi comic book series, written by Kevin J.
