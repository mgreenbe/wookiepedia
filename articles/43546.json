Both cunning and vengeful, Zahra served at the helm of the Star Destroyer Tarkin's Will. Zahra rose through the Empire as the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Governor Wilhuff Tarkin. After she failed Tarkin during a mission, Zahra's mentor dismissed her, though Zahra attempted to regain his favor. However, Tarkin perished aboard the Death Star battle station when it was destroyed by the Rebel Alliance during the Battle of Yavin. Zahra held a personal grudge against Princess Leia Organa of the Rebellion for Tarkin's death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Battle of Hoth, Zahra was assigned to lead attacks on the divisions of the scattered Alliance Fleet. She failed to prevent the rebel Fourth Division from escaping due to the intervention of the rebels aboard the freighter Millennium Falcon, including Organa. Zahra continued to hunt down other divisions, but desired to destroy the Fourth Division and Organa along with it. During a battle against the Fourth and Seventh Divisions at Elessia, Zahra confronted Organa personally, wounding the rebel leader with her blade\u2014an act Zahra believed would demoralize Organa."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Service to the Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ellian Zahra was born to parents who were eventually killed, along with the rest of her family, in a rebel terrorist attack when she was still young. Forced to survive on her own for some time, Zahra entered into the Imperial Academy during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Due to her lack of familial or other ties, Zahra was one of several students selected by Governor Wilhuff Tarkin, who provided instruction and influence. Rising through the Academy, Zahra scored at the highest level in the Empire's selection exams, entering into Imperial service."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Tarkin brought Zahra, along with two of his other prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Beldin and Hannevik, to his homeworld of Eriadu. In order to test them and determine the one who would remain his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Tarkin sent them to hunt down an albino veermok on the Carrion Plateau. Managing to catch the veermok in the forest, Zahra successfully killed the creature. She additionally determined that Tarkin intended for the candidates to hunt each other, and as such defeated her fellow colleagues. She returned to Tarkin with the veermok's head, having passed the test set by her mentor. Zahra continued to rise through the Empire under Tarkin's mentorship, accompanying him on Imperial business and combating efforts of rebellion.

Zahra took a strike force that included Tarkin's flagship, the Carrion Spike, tracking Ro down using a network of probe droids. On the cloaked Carrion Spike, Zahra followed Ro to his stronghold, destroying the stronghold and Ro's forces."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, upon Zahra's return to the Death Star, Tarkin informed her that she had instead killed one of Ro's decoys, and the real warlord had used her failure to elevate himself. Tarkin was disappointed by Zahra's failure, believing he had been wrong in choosing her as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Zahra was ordered to report to the personnel office for reassignment, but instead continued to search for Ro. Having tracked Ro down, Zahra returned to Tarkin a week later, amidst a Rebel Alliance\u2014the Battle of Yavin. However, Zahra's efforts to meet with Tarkin were denied."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zahra resolved to hunt Ro herself, demanding the use of a shuttle from a Death Star hangar. The stormtrooper guarding the shuttle refused, having been assigned to hold the shuttle for the potential evacuation of high-ranking Imperial officers. Believing that the rebel attack was futile, Zahra knocked the trooper unconscious and commandeered the shuttle, setting a message to be transmitted to Tarkin, informing her mentor of her mission. However, as Zahra departed the Death Star, the space station was destroyed by the rebels, killing those aboard, including Tarkin. Holding Princess Leia Organa responsible for her mentor's death, Zahra vowed to kill her to avenge Tarkin. As per orders from Tarkin before his death, Zahra was indefinitely assigned non-essential duties.

With orders from Emperor Palpatine to have the remnants of the fleet hunted down and destroyed, the Sith Lord Darth Vader, having noticed Zahra's record, assigned her to the task. Vader allowed Zahra to be given any resources that were necessary, but warned her not to fail both him and the Emperor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Given the opportunity to choose any vessel in the Imperial Navy as her flagship, Zahra took command of the Fortitude, an Imperial II-class Star Destroyer that had been damaged in the Battle of Yavin, and rechristened it as the Tarkin's Will. As a memorial to the loss of the Death Star, Zahra chose other Imperials who had lost close individuals in the station's destruction as her crew.

Zahra split her forces, sending a fleet to attack the Eighth Division near Malastare while she led an attack on the Fourth Division, which was attempting to regroup at Rendezvous Point Delta-Three. Zahra utilized a tactic she had previously devised, blockading the rebel fleet with a turbolaser cordon and trapping them against a star. Unable to escape, the Fourth Division suffered heavy losses."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When one rebel X-wing starfighter escaped the blockade, Zahra requested that she take manual control of a turbolaser. An Imperial technician was hesitant to do so, but gave control to Zahra upon the insistence of Lieutenant Gorr. Manually controlling the turbolaser, Zahra managed to hit and destroy the starfighter. The arrival of the freighter Millennium Falcon, carrying several prominent members of the Rebel Alliance including Organa, interfered with Zahra's plans. The Falcon managed to destroy one of the Imperial light cruisers, allowing the survivors of the Fourth Division to escape to hyperspace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having failed to eliminate the rebel cells, Zahra contacted Darth Vader, who reprimanded her, both for her lack of success and for attempting to destroy the Millennium Falcon, which, unknown to Zahra, carried Luke Skywalker, the son of Vader, who the Sith Lord wanted alive.

Although her forces were able to eliminate all targets within the system, they had no leads as to the locations of the remaining cells, though Zahra was certain that the insurgents would be found. When Lieutenant Gorr, unaware of the Star Destroyer's history, requested that repairs be made to the ship, Zahra chastised Lieutenant Gorr, informing him that the Tarkin's Will served as a memorial to those who died aboard the Death Star, and that the damage it sustained in the battle was a reminder of all who they had lost."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zahra later intercepted transmissions from a group of rebels who she believed were the Alliance Fleet's Seventh Division. Her forces continued to track the division's movements, waiting for it to contact, and subsequently reveal the location of, another cell. Zahra contacted Vader, reporting her plan. Vader was pleased at her progress, but became distracted by the activation of a trap he had set at a Jedi outpost on the astronomical object Tempes. When Vader ordered his pilot to set a course for Tempes, Zahra offered to bring the Tarkin's Will to assist, but Vader insisted that he would handle it himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Fourth Division responded to the Seventh Division's transmission, Zahra intended to send a second strike force after the Seventh Division while attacking the Fourth Division herself in order to eliminate Organa. However, after Lieutenant Gorr noted that their fleet was closer to the Seventh Division, Zahra relented, allowing the other force to pursue the Fourth. While Zahra's attack on the Seventh Division at Elessia appeared to be overwhelming their targets, her secondary strike force arrived at the Fourth Division's coordinates to find the rebels had already left. Zahra was about to reprimand Gorr when the vessels of the Fourth Division emerged from hyperspace behind the Imperial fleet."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Confronting Organa"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zahra intended to lead a boarding party against the rebel fleet, ordering Gorr to prepare her shuttle. Gorr questioned if it was wise for Zahra to lead a boarding party amidst the battle, but Zahra insisted that it was necessary to complete the mission herself. Instructing Gorr to take command of the battle and follow her own methods, Zahra and her team of stormtroopers boarded the EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate that served as the Fourth Division's flagship, cutting down the rebel troopers that attempted to stop them. Zahra made her way to the vessel's engine room, disabling its safety systems. Contacting the frigate's commanders, Zahra informed them of the vessel's imminent destruction, vowing to reactivate the systems and save the ship if Organa came alone to the engine room."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Organa did as she had been asked, and Zahra trapped her in the engine room once she entered. Zahra promised Organa that she would not use her blaster and that she would let Organa go if she reached the exit on the opposite side of the room alive. Hidden from Organa's view, Zahra told her about her life, including the death of her family and becoming Tarkin's prot\u00e9g\u00e9. As she spoke, Zahra struck Organa multiple times with her blade. Before Zahra could take her revenge, she was contacted by the Tarkin's Will\u2014which intended to flee under the fire of both rebel divisions\u2014and was then confronted by Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After warning Organa that she would return, Zahra distracted Skywalker by throwing her blade past his head, subsequently leaping over the Jedi and kicking him in the back. Zahra broke through a viewport to escape the rebel ship and flew aboard the Tarkin's Will with her jetpack, boarding the Star Destroyer before it departed.

She saw everything as a resource, considering ways of utilizing her resources in the best way possible. A vengeful and cunning commander, Ellian Zahra was devoted to serving the Empire, despite her previous failures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zahra was initially unable to accept Tarkin's dismissal of her despite understanding it, attempting to make up for her failure to regain her mentor's faith. Zahra felt that the Death Star superweapon was the Emperor's greatest effort to maintain peace, and saw its destruction as a tragic massacre of loyal Imperial subjects. After losing Tarkin in the destruction of the Death Star, Zahra was angered that he had died before she could redeem herself to him, and blamed Leia Organa for the act, wishing to slit Organa's throat in revenge. She assumed Tarkin had intended her to learn from her dismissal and subsequent assignment of non-essential duties and that she would have received an opportunity to receive herself if Tarkin had lived. Zahra became cynical during her time stationed on Kessel, not expecting anyone to call for her and being surprised when she was contacted by Vader."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After being chosen to lead the hunt for the rebel fleet, Zahra honored those lost on the Death Star by taking command of a Star Destroyer that was damaged in its destruction, recruiting a crew that consisted of others who had lost someone on the station.

When Zahra failed to prevent the survivors of the Fourth Division from escaping her attack, she grew angry at Lieutenant Gorr, who stated the self-evident details of the situation.

She devised a method of using probe droids as a surveillance network, utilizing the approach against Burnium Ro. Zahra also created a tactic in which an enemy fleet was trapped against a celestial body by a cordon of turbolasers. While attacking the Fourth Division of the Alliance Fleet, Zahra took control of one of her fleet's lasers, manually targeting and destroying an escaped rebel starfighter.
