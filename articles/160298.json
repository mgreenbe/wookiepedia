Young Mandalorians began training in military and survival skills under the tutelage of a parent, typically at the age of eight years old. The training lasted until the child reached the age of thirteen, at which time they were tested on their acquired skills in fighting and surviving with the verd'goten. Upon passing the trial of the verd'goten, the Mandalorian was considered legally an adult, and had earned equal treatment in Mandalorian society. It was customary for fellow Mandalorians to share a drink with and toast the new Mandalorian adult upon the completion of their verd'goten."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though Akaavi Spar, a Zabrak Mandalorian woman, completed her verd'goten at the age of thirteen, she began training under her father at the age of three, instead of the more commonly accepted age of eight. In 25 ABY, Dinua Jeban completed her verd'goten. The young Mandalorian and her mother, Briika, celebrated her ascent to legal adulthood at the Bar Jaraniz on Nar Shaddaa. Amidst their revelry, the Mandalorian passerby Goran Beviin bought the pair a round of drinks and congratulated Jeban on her coming of age. Years later, in the wake of the Yuuzhan Vong War, Mandalorian father Novoc Vevut trained and guided his adopted son Ghes Orade through the verd'goten on Mandalore."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mandalorian coming of age rite was first introduced to Star Wars canon in the video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. It was later identified as the verd'goten in the article The Mandalorians: People and Culture, written by author Karen Traviss and published in February of 2006 in the eighty-sixth issue of the Star Wars Insider magazine. The traditional rite was later mentioned in Traviss' Star Wars: Legacy of the Force novel Legacy of the Force: Bloodlines, as well as her The New Jedi Order e-novella, Boba Fett: A Practical Man. The verd'goten was also referred to in Traviss' fourth entry into the Republic Commando novel series, Order 66: A Republic Commando Novel, and in Star Wars: The Old Republic, an MMORPG created by BioWare and released in 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
