Razor, Stak, and Windu then found the Twi'lek Resistance after they took out a droid patrol. They were then taken to their hideout. When they were inside Stak tried touch a blurrg, but the blurrg roared and Stak was told to be careful. Syndulla agreed to help the Republic. Later Stak took part in infiltrating Lessu with Windu and Razor. Together, they were able stow aboard one of the Multi-Troop Transports loaded with treasure across the Plasma bridge. When droids scanned and discovered the three of them, Razor and Stak were then Force-pushed by Windu across the bridge. Razor and Stak then lifted and followed Windu into Lessu. Razor and Stak then went to the control room where they eliminated the battle droids and activated the bridge in time to allow both the freedom fighters' blurrgs and Lightning Squadron's All Terrain Reconnaissance Transports to cross. They then defended the control against B1-series battle droids and a pair of BX-series droid commandos."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
