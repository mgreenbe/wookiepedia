This was their normal mental state and was not considered a psychosis, as it would be in a Human. As they grew older and developed, they usually discovered more \"minds,\" and gradually improved upon their skill in switching between them. These personalities had various abilities and skills, behaviors, and views on life. These could include an undisciplined yet skilled pilot, a calm and polite socializer, an arrogant, elitist mind, an insane one (which only caused slight problems, since they could still switch to other \"minds\"), and others. This ability also helped them figure out how others would think, increasing their ability to imitate their target's writings or thought processes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They also possessed, on average, three times the strength of an average human male.
