Their society and culture revolved primarily around agrarian pursuits. Most Ukians spent the majority of their time cultivating and organizing their harvests. Even individual Ukians would own sprawling farming complexes. The farming on Ukio was directly overseen by the Ukian Farming Bureau."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The entire planet was run by an Overliege, and other Lieges worked beneath him. The Overliege was an elected official who served a term of ten years. At the end of the ten-year period, the Ukian with the most productive harvest on the planet was offered the position of Overliege. His duties consisted of improving the total agricultural output of the planet, and well as determining which crops each community would be responsible for."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ukians greatly feared anything they deemed to be \"impossible\". Any completely unforeseen or bizarre event would cause them to become agitated and frightened. Off-worlders such as business executives or enemy commanders would use this fear against the Ukians, causing them to be at a disadvantage. Few Ukians ever left their homeworld, but those that did most often pursued a career in agriculture."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, the Republic, knowing the importance of Ukio to the efforts of the Clone Wars, sent Jedi Masters Keelyvine Reus and Kit Fisto, along with Padawan Tyzen Xebec, to ensure the safety and security of the planet. While Xebec and Clone Commander Ganch inspected the planet's shield defenses, the Confederacy of Independent Systems launched an attack on the planet, deploying modified Seismic tanks. The tanks hovered above the planet's shields and let loose a cloud of soil from Moorja, which blotted out the sun and threatened to destroy the Ukian's harvest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 9 ABY, Grand Admiral Thrawn studied Ukian art and was able to determine the Ukian's fear of surprise and the unknown.
