The weapon was capable of electrocuting opponents as well as completely disintegrating targets. Djarin used the deadly weapon to great effect during his bounty hunting career."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This modified sniper rifle had a long barrel and a brown stock. It was tipped with a fork-shaped resonator and a specially-calibrated visual scope. It could deliver a paralyzing electrical pulse at close range, and at long range, it could disintegrate organic matter on contact."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 9 ABY, the bounty hunter Din Djarin used this rifle on several missions. On his expedition to claim the bounty on the Mythrol on the planet Maldo Kreis, he used the taser function on a Ravinak that attacked his ship, the Razor Crest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After being commissioned by the Client to acquire an asset known as Grogu on the planet Arvala-7, Djarin used it as a scouting scope upon his arrival and wielded the rifle later to combat several Trandoshan bounty hunters who were seeking to claim his bounty. When Djarin discovered that Jawas had stripped his ship for parts, he fired on them from a distance, disintegrating several members of their group. When Djarin was forced to retrieve a mudhorn egg in return for parts to repair his ship, he used the weapon without great effect on the large creature."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Djarin later used the weapon's taser function on an Imperial remnant stormtrooper while rescuing Grogu from their compound. However, after crossing the Client, Greef Karga and members of the Bounty Hunters' Guild came after him, ambushing him in the middle to the street. When Djarin was pinned down, several hunters advanced on him, but Djarin used the weapon to disintegrate several of them, causing the survivors to take cover. Djarin continued to fire before escaping with the help of the Tribe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While defending a human tribe's village on Sorgan, Djarin used the weapon against an invading Klatooinian tribe. When the Klatooinian AT-ST Raider failed to activate their trap, he gave the rifle to his new comrade, the former shock trooper Carasynthia Dune, who then jumped into the pond and fired at the walker in order to bait it into their trap."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Djarin also utilised the taser function of the weapon to electrocute the insides of a Krayt dragon, effectively forcing it to open its mouth after engulfing Djarin, allowing him to escape from the stomach of the beast."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The scouting scope was used by Djarin on the woods of Corvus while seeking for Ahsoka Tano."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rifle was aboard the Razor Crest on Tython while Djarin took Grogu to an ancient stone temple of the Jedi.

However, it traces its design back to the weapon of Boba Fett in the animated segment of 1978's The Star Wars Holiday Special, the first Star Wars television property and the first appearance of Mandalorian armor. Its initial appearance in The Mandalorian pays homage to the Holiday Special, being used to ward off a subterranean beast (a ravinak in The Mandalorian versus a Panna dragon in the Holiday Special) attempting to devour a starship with the protagonists on board."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
