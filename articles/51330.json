A glop grenade could be compared to a thermal detonator in its size, material and shape; however, unlike the detonator, it had several spray nozzles across it's the body. Each glop grenade had a timer that could be set to either detonate on contact or after a delay of up to fifteen seconds. When using the glop, the user would set the detonation time and throw it at their target."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sphere hosts a refillable reservoir filled with glop: a semi-liquid foam that instantaneously hardens upon contact with oxygen. The glop can be refilled via specially pressurized hypoinjectors from a sealed container to prevent exposing it to the atmosphere. When deployed, the grenade's contents spray out from the nozzles across a broad area, quickly hardening and trapping everything caught in its range with a thick, nearly unbreakable substance comparable to ferrocrete. After only five minutes, the glop breaks down and becomes brittle, making it easy to shatter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite being classified as a non-lethal device, glop could accidentally suffocate or, in extremely rare situations, cause an allergic reaction against a target. These factors resulted in the occasional death of one caught in the glop's grip. Usual purchases of a glop grenade included a hypoinjector and five glop canisters made to refill the grenade. If one wanted to purchase another glop canister, it would cost 100 credits per container."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
