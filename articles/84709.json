The Centax-class heavy frigate Ranger was armed with two MG1-A torpedo batteries and was the first ever vessel to employ them in combat. In the opening shot of the battle above Praesitlyn, Ranger fired a salvo of the warheads at a Separatist Droid Control ship, who was jamming signals in the area, successfully eliminating the target."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "MG1-As had an effective range of three thousand kilometers and a flight velocity of twenty thousand kilometers per hour relative to their launch platform. They were unaffected by most energy fields and their homing systems could be deactivated to allow for unguided use as line-of-sight weapons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
