In the aftermath of the Galactic Civil War, Hux was sent into the Unknown Regions where the First Order rose seeking to reclaim the glory of the Galactic Empire. A ruthless officer by the time of the Cold War, Hux engineered the death of his father, oversaw the training and indoctrination of a new generation of stormtroopers, and ordered the firing of the Starkiller superweapon to destroy the New Republic capital of Hosnian Prime.

Disillusioned with his place in Ren's regime, he supplied the Resistance with information about the Sith fleet on Exegol, determined to see his rival lose the war.

Hux was fathered by Commandant Brendol Hux, though not with his father's wife Maratelle, but rather a kitchen woman, making Hux the commandant's bastard son. Hux never knew his mother and as a boy remained utterly friendless.

Grand Admiral Rae Sloane suspected that Hux was regularly abused by his father, both psychologically and physically, suspicions which proved to be true. Hux would find comfort and strength in his father's stories of how the Empire brought peace to a galaxy that had weathered the chaos of the Clone Wars, comforting him even as Hux weathered his own abuse under his father. Because of his Imperial heritage, Hux developed notions of grandeur and believed that he had a right to sit on the throne that ruled the galaxy. At an early age, Hux promised to himself that he would prove his father's preconceptions of him wrong. Taking inspiration from the legacy of Sheev Palpatine, the Naboo senator who became the Galactic Emperor, Hux believed that he was also capable of gaining absolute power. As such, Hux envisioned himself as the galaxy's future ruler, a savior bringing peace to the chaos for which he held the New Republic responsible."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The young Hux became acquainted with his father's fellow officers, such as Enric Pryde, who was a friend of both Brendol and Maratelle, and Admiral Brooks, who openly ridiculed Hux's illegitimacy. Brooks once mocked Hux after he accidentally dropped their refreshments, suggesting that the illegitimate son of a kitchen woman should at least be capable of serving drinks. As Brendol expressed his contempt for his son, calling him pathetic and utterly useless, Hux promised to clean the mess, to which Brooks suggested that he lick the floor. Hux looked to his father for help before acquiescing to the admiral's request.

As the New Republic laid siege to Arkanis, the Hux family was forced to evacuate their homeworld in 5 ABY. Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax, a political prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the late Emperor Palpatine, became invested in the future of Brendol Hux because of the commandant's visionary ideas on stormtrooper training.

In the months prior to the Battle of Jakku, the Huxes remained close at Rax's side, who effectively led the Imperial show government as the self-styled Counselor to the Empire. Hux tried to keep his distance from his father, who continued mistreating him, while Brendol trained twenty-four local orphans.

Rax intended to detonate Jakku's planetary core, wiping out both the New Republic and the Empire in a single stroke, before taking Hux and Brendol to the Unknown Regions where they could create a new Empire. As they traveled to the observatory, Hux found himself alone in the transport hold with the child soldiers. The older children intimidated him, as they had been trained by his father to become ruthless killers. Until then, Rax was focused on what Brendol offered to the new Empire that he intended to build in the old regime's place.

Putting his new authority to the test, Hux ordered one of the boys to strike his comrade. After reaching the observatory, the Huxes were bidden by the Counselor to board his luxury yacht\u2014a replica of the Emperor's Imperialis.

Hux likewise protected Sloane from the child soldiers, who remained loyal only to himself in accordance with Rax's last wishes. Sloane berated Brendol, warning the commandant to cease hurting his son. However, she also wanted Hux to benefit from his father's experience and as such Brendol was ordered to educate his illegitimate son as he would a proper heir. For several months, the Imperialis traveled through the Unknown Regions, and in that time, Hux and his soldiers grew even more vicious under Brendol's tutelage. Even Sloane was taken aback by Hux's cruelty, which she considered to be an unusual trait for such a small boy.

He eventually gained the status of general, becoming the youngest First Order officer to hold that military rank while also serving as a member of First Order High Command.

This included the quiet elimination of Hux's father, Brendol, the elder General Hux. Knowing how his father truly felt about him, Hux resolved to kill his father, although this was not the only reason behind his patricidal actions. Driven by ambition and a sense of destiny, he saw Brendol as an obstacle in his path to gaining greater power. To that end, he enlisted the help of Captain Phasma, and the two conspirators agreed that the old Imperial veteran had to be permanently removed so as to promote their own interests."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Hux had no reservations about committing patricide, he left the actual killing to his co-conspirator, whom he instructed to use an untraceable method, not wanting the murder to be traced back to himself. Phasma therefore utilized a toxin, taken from the bite of a Parnassos beetle, to assassinate Brendol. Once the deed was done, Hux proceeded with formalities by addressing the members of the First Order Stormtrooper Corps, informing them that their founder had died. After concluding his speech, Hux wasted no time in positioning himself as his father's successor, and even took possession of Brendol's suite on the Absolution."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the years following Brendol's demise, Hux remodeled the First Order army according to his design, promoting Phasma to complete the older stormtrooper cadets' training. Her methods emphasized loyalty, obedience and ruthlessness, qualities that met with Armitage's approval. Keeping with his habit of eliminating potential threats, Hux sidelined Captain Cardinal, knowing that the latter was a loyal supporter of the general's late father. Cardinal eventually concluded that Phasma was the culprit behind his mentor's death, though he was unaware of Hux's role in it. He reported his findings to Hux, who revealed his own involvement in the conspiracy that assassinated his father.

The man then ran off, far away as possible from the Empire, and came to the planet. Hux, after finding out the man's name, which was Bylsma, told him that the Empire had fallen years before. Bylsma was skeptical and asked Hux how could he know that Hux spoke the truth. Hux told him that the truth was Kylo Ren. He then informed Bylsma that Kylo Ren was Ben Solo, son of Leia Organa, Princess of Alderaan and that Ben's parents had won the war. Bylsma then asked about the Death Star. Hux told him that the Death Star and its successor had both been destroyed. Bylsma was surprised when he heard that the Empire had built a second Death Star.

Though the First Order possessed maps from the Empire that would lead them to the planet where Skywalker was hiding, they lacked a final piece. To that end, the Finalizer traveled to Jakku and dispatched a group of stormtroopers to attack the settlement of Tuanul, where Ren captured a Resistance pilot named Poe Dameron, who already acquired and hid the final piece of the map.

Hux humbly took full responsibility for his failure, but the Supreme Leader interrupted him, declaring that their strategy had to change. Hux suggested testing the superweapon and destroy the New Republic for supporting the Resistance, leaving their enemies vulnerable. After receiving authorization for the undertaking, Hux then assembled the First Order army at Starkiller Base and gave a grand speech, proclaiming that the destruction of the Republic would be the beginning of the First Order's rise to power in the galaxy.

Ren brought Rey back to Starkiller Base and attempted to extract the map from her mind, only to learn that the girl was strong in the Force and turned his own mind probe against him. Hux later walked in a conversation between Ren and Snoke, the latter asking what happened to BB-8. The general humiliated his colleague by telling the Supreme Leader that Ren decided the droid was no longer valuable to the First Order's mission, and that the girl was all they needed.

Like other members of his generation, who served as the vanguard of First Order leadership, Hux was strikingly young, but what he lacked in experience and wisdom, he made up for in his zeal.

This responsibility fell to the First Order, as the New Republic, in Hux's view, was too weak to prevent the inevitable chaos.

The fact that Ren required rescuing from Starkiller Base after losing to a lightsaber novice particularly delighted the young general. His hatred for Ren extended to his followers, the Knights of Ren, despising them for their unkempt appearance as well as their tendency to tread dirt into the polished halls of First Order capital ships.
