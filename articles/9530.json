It was a modified Imperial Repeater Rifle weapon. 1.2 meters long, the wide body had two barrels with two triggers. The first trigger fired a deadly blue-white plasma shot (maximum capacity 400) at an approximate rate of 540 RPM, the second firing compact, dumb-fire missiles (20). Blasts from this weapon were extremely lethal, capable of punching through body armor and killing soldiers in a single shot. Only soldiers equipped with a Personal energy shield could hope to stand a chance against a trooper equipped with this deadly weapon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Phase III Trooper carried a similar weapon. It was essentially a standard assault cannon with five plasma barrels, which allowed the user to fire at a much faster rate, and had an increased ammunition capacitor to compensate. This version lacked the missile launcher used by the Phase IIs and was much too heavy for a human soldier to wield effectively."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though the weapon was exclusively designed for the Dark Trooper battle droid, an ordinary soldier could grip, aim, and fire it. Kyle Katarn was able to acquire such a weapon during the campaign to eliminate the Dark Trooper Project, using it to great effect in keeping Phase II Dark Troopers at bay."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
