Unlike most craft in the TIE Series, the boarding craft was equipped with landing gear and was able to land on a hangar deck instead of in an overhead launch rack. Passengers could then disembark via a boarding ramp.

A TIE/br designated boarding craft 356 was hijacked by Han Solo and Sharlee after infiltrating and taking out its crew by using a life pod and SOS signal, in an attempt to ensure the planet of Constancia remained free from Imperial involvement and for Luke to deliver a message to the planet. A TIE Boarding Craft was also utilized by the T'Syri\u00e9l members of the Stormtrooper Corps helmed by the Kaleesh warlord, General Bentilais san Sk'ar, to capture Princess Leia Organa and Aron Peacebringer on Shiva IV."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This ship was designed for the very first Star Wars film, but the exterior model would not make it into any scenes.
