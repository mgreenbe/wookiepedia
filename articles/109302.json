A quarrel, when fired from a bowcaster, was enveloped in plasma blaster energy using the positive and negative polarizing orbs balanced on each end of a bowcaster. The quarrel's momentum would be sped up by the magnetic field of the polarizing orbs once the bowcaster was fired. This created a destructive bolt of energy that required the strength of a Wookiee to fire comfortably."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
