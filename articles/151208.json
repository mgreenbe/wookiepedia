The sticky-sweet cake was filled with a variety of nuts and dried fruit, and infused with a sweet spiced syrup that kept the dense cake moist. A favorite treat among Mandalorians, the recipe for uj cake was handed down from generation to generation. Uj'alayi was served at a number of special occasions, including celebratory victory feasts and clan get-togethers. Mandalorian soldiers were even reputed to carry pieces of uj'alayi into battle with them, stowed in their armor despite the cake's stickiness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Artiodac chef Strono Tuggs, who was not a member  of the primarily-human Mandalorian culture, came into possession of a recipe for authentic uj'alayi through circumstances he would later decline to share.
