In 3963 BBY, around the outbreak of the Mandalorian Wars, Cressa had commissioned the Jedi Master Raana Tey to a special assignment. During the last stages of the battle of the Outer Rim planet Taris, Cressa began an investigation into how the ecumenopolis gained such a quick entry into the Republic. Three years before Cressa's investigation, Taris was admitted into the Republic thanks to the efforts of Lhosan Industries Chairman Jervo Thalien and Haydel Goravvus, who bribed other senators in order to secure admission into the Republic. After the death of Admiral Jimas Veltraa during the battle, the Chancellor overruled renaming an Interdictor-class cruiser after Veltraa. During the Mandalorian occupation of Taris, Cressa assigned Tey to locate and aid Goravvus, who became the planet's senator after Taris became a Republic world.
