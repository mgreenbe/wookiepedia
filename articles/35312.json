With their Father's days numbered, the Force wielders lured the Chosen One, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker to Mortis in order to test his potential.

Anakin and his Jedi companions reluctantly accepted the Daughter's offer. However, while they were walking along a rock cliff, a rock collapsed and separated the Daughter and Skywalker from Kenobi and Ahsoka.

However, Skywalker used his Force powers to force the Daughter and the Son to release his Jedi comrades and to revert back to their humanoid forms.

They encountered the Son in his inner sanctum but her brother was unfazed and instead pointed his sister and Kenobi to the scene of Anakin fighting against Ahsoka, who had been corrupted by the Son.

As a result, the planet began to descend into darkness. In the wake of the Daughter's death, the Father and the Jedi resolved not to let the Son get access to the Jedi's shuttle and return to the galaxy.

Sometime after the excavation's start, Jedi Padawan Ezra Bridger and the Mandalorian warrior Sabine Wren, who acted as agents of the Rebel Alliance, infiltrated the dig site. Wren and Bridger studied the mural that depicted the Mortis gods, hoping to discern a method of opening the temple. Placing his hand onto the Daughter's encircled hand, Bridger used the Force to activate the mural.

We are the middle, the beginning, and the end\" began to emanate from the painting in the Daughter's voice. Proceeding this, the depiction of the Father moved, opening a gateway for Ezra.
