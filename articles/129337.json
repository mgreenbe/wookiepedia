It was commanded by Vicelord Siv Kav and Commander \"Stratis\". The ships were operated by skeleton crews to keep secrecy to a maximum. After a confrontation with Commander Thrawn of the CEDF, only the flagship, Darkvenge, was not destroyed. The task force was most likely disbanded, as only one ship remained intact, and Darth Sidious wished to hide all traces of Outbound Flight's destruction from the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Ships"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
