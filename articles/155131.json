During the Imperial fragmentation following the Battle of Endor, the Torpedo Sphere became the flagship of Grand Admiral Danetta Pitta, who had bribed the Corellian Diktat to take control of the system. In 5 ABY, the forces of Grand Admiral Josef Grunger attempted to secure the Corellian system. In the Battle of Tralus, Pitta used the Torpedo Sphere's weaponry to lay waste to Grunger's fleet. In a last ditch move, Grunger used his own flagship, the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Aggressor, to ram Pitta's Torpedo Sphere, destroyed both vessels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
