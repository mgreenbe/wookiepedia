In 3 BBY, Agent Kallus, a member of the Imperial Security Bureau, and Garazeb Orrelios, an anti-Empire freedom fighter, found themselves trapped together in a cavern on Bahryn after the escape pod they were in crash-landed on the moon. While trying to overcome their enmity and find a way out, the two were attacked by a bonzami, which they successfully fended off using their bo-rifles. Later, two bonzami emerged, but the pair managed to narrowly escape through the hole punched through the cave's ceiling."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bonzami first appeared in \"The Honorable Ones,\" the fifteenth episode of the second season of the animated television series Star Wars Rebels.
