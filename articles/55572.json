After Ziro had been taken away to the detention area, Gorga and the rest of the council were entertained by a performance of Da Hutt Moda by Pa'lowick singer Sy Snootles. At the start of the performance, Gorga adjusted his monocle and nodded his approval to his fellow colleagues. Gorga watched as Snootles made her way to towards him and sat on the table before him as she continued to sing. Snootles gave him a quick kiss which surprised the Hutt before breaking out with glee on his face."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Snootle's performance, Gorga was enjoying the entertainment of the Twi'lek dancers when Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Quinlan Vos entered the council chamber.
