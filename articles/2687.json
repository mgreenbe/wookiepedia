The story sends a group of characters on an errand for Lieutenant Amalia, who asks them to recover a stolen piece of military gear and to do so secretly. The characters travel to the area where the hardware was stolen and come under attack themselves. After combatting starfighters, the characters track their attackers to the planet O'reen, in the Unknown Regions. There, they see a battle cruiser being prepped for a military excursion in orbit. They sneak past the patrols and land on the world, where they break into an analysis center and recover their prize, a top-secret tactical computer. The O'reenians detect them, though, so they fight their way back outside and to their starship to escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
