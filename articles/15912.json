During the Clone Wars, Telsla's crew overthrew Tomarian's Annual Festival of Light Gala held at the his theater of the Naboo resident Tomarian, who owed them a debt. After entering Tomarian's theater, the crew used gas concocted by Belk in order to knock out the celebration's guests, including Tomarian's Jedi Knight protector, Anakin Skywalker. Belk later searched within the theater to determine if anyone else remained in the building\u2014though Fleecs had already looked inside, he was not satisfied with the extent of her surveillance. Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo, who had managed to escape the gas attack by being inside the theater, ambushed Belk as he searched the room, incapacitating the criminal and taking his blaster. After detonating an explosive on the theater's stage, Telsla noticed that Belk had not returned; Fleecs suggested that he had been backstage and had gotten caught in the explosion, and Telsla was unconcerned by the thought."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
