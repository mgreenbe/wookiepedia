Sometime after the Battle of Yavin, an infestation of gundravian hookspores was discovered on the Imperial wreckage-prison Accresker Jail by one of the prisoners, the rogue archaeologist Chelli Lona Aphra. In response to the infectious fungus, which had also been imbued with the Force abilities of a dead Jedi, Accresker command declared that the prison was decommissioned, evacuating the staff on escape pods."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Empire then fired Accresker Jail on a collision trajectory with Tiferep Major to eliminate both the rebel sympathizers on the planet and the hookspore infestation on the prison.

The Dark Lord of the Sith, whom Tolvan had secretly contacted earlier, had arrived at Accresker Jail, searching for the individual who had contacted him.
