Once Gelesi inherited a position as Captain of the Guard after his predecessor was murdered, he grew paranoid that he would share the same fate. Fear for his life and the lives of his family members fueled Gelesi's anxiety and drove him to consider secretly evacuating his family from Onderon, although he decided against it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gelesi mentions his wife in Obsidian Entertainment's Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords if the Jedi Exile, the player's character, decides to support General Vaklu's efforts to become king of Onderon instead of defending the current regent, Queen Talia, during her first visit to Onderon in the game. The Exile is then able to convince Gelesi to leave the planet. If the latter option is chosen, Gelesi professes his concern for his family, an admission that can be used as leverage to persuade him to leave Onderon. This elective has not been given an official canonical option, but, because The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia established that the Exile supported Talia during a second visit, this article assumes she supported the queen during her first visit and that Gelesi was not convinced to emigrate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
