The Incinerator-class was one of several exotic weapons produced by Czerka at the time, and it fired plasma bolts enclosed in magnetic fields. Like many rail guns, it had an extraordinary range and inflicted massive damage when fully charged. The plasma bolts did not directly pierce enemy shields but instead continued to burn a target after impact, inflicting significant damage over time to both shields and the hull."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
