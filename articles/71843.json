On Gavens, the marriage produced a young daughter which they named Akanah. The arrival of his daughter brought a new feeling of responsibility to Joreb.

While there, Joreb got himself caught up in the drug-trafficking business. Sampling the very powerful drug Rokna blue, Joreb began to forget all semblances of his former life. In dazed confusion from the effects of the drug, Joreb set up camp on Atzerri taking small jobs to pay for his increasing addiction to the powerful drug."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many years later, Joreb had taken up residence in Atrium 41, a scumhole apartment on Atzerri.
