By 1 ABY, the situation had grown desperate, as the Snogars were no longer able to operate the hydroelectric generators that powered the heating machines that were vital to their survival. The Snogars thus began searching for offworlders who perhaps had the technical knowledge to aid them. Their prayers were seemingly answered when a group of Snogars captured Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker and Boba Fett and attempted to force them to fix their generators, but the encounter only resulted in a few dead Snogars and the natives fleeing their city from a vengeful Fett."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Snogars first appeared in The Frozen World of Ota, a comic strip arc written by Russ Manning, Rick Hoberg and Don Christensen and released in 1980."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
