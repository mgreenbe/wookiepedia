In 43.5 ABY, when Jedi Knights Leia Organa Solo, Jaden Korr, Tekli, and Avinoam Arelis, along with Organa Solo's husband, Han Solo, attempted to evacuate three psychotic Jedi Knights from the New Jedi Temple on Coruscant, a group of Mandalorian Supercommandos hired by Galactic Federation of Free Alliances Chief of State Natasi Daala attacked them outside of the Krabbis Inn, a hostel near the Jedi Temple. One of the Supercommandos, armed with an R-20 scatterblaster, opened fire on Organa Solo, forcing her to retreat behind a nearby bridge. The Mandalorians were eventually defeated, however, and the psychotic Jedi were successfully evacuated from the Temple."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The R-20 scatterblaster was created by established Star Wars author Troy Denning for his first installment\u2014and the third novel overall\u2014in the nine-part Fate of the Jedi series, Fate of the Jedi: Abyss, released August 18, 2009."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
