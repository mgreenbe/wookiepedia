While lacking a formal military, the warriors were usually sufficient in dealing with both criminal or security issues. Typically, the Geonosian warriors served their queens and took orders from no one else. In battle, these warriors threw themselves at their enemies in whatever numbers available. Their armies lacked any concept of squads, ranks or orders of battle. As a result, an encounter with the Geonosian Hive Army could lead to conflicts with either a handful of regulars, a swarm of elite warriors, or even a combination of the two, however, they did often employ ambush tactics."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
