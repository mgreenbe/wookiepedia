It was made from strong synthetic fibers and was mostly used in 10-meter-square sections, but it was also sold in larger pieces. In addition to its intended use on board the freighters, cargo netting could be used in traps\u2014as part of the pitfall or weighed from the edges to trap something underneath. However cargo netting was not ideal when used in unconventional way because it could be easily cut with a blade and was vulnerable to blaster fire. During the Galactic Civil War, SoroSuub Corporation manufactured the 1010 Cargo Restraint and sold it for one hundred credits by ten-by-ten meter section."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
