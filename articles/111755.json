It was smaller than the standard Imperial garrison and could be deployed from smaller ships. They were often built off-site and delivered via a shuttle or dropship. The stations were typically used for short term military operations, police actions, or training. They could be deployed to harsh environments, like vacuums. If more space was required, multiple stations could be linked together to form a larger facility."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Layout"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Rapid Deployment station consisted of an octagonal base and up to four modular compartments. These would differ depending on the mission. The base was surrounded by a thick metal mesh that was electrified to prevent animals or other creatures from getting under the station. While not intended for heavy combat, they could be armed with weapon emplacements."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Modular units"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There were nine different types of modular units that could be installed in a Rapid Deployment station. Four were for support and five were for habitation. These included electronics, laboratories, medical, detention, living quarters, command centers, and conference rooms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
