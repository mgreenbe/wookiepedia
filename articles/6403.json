Although Ammuud was settled as a peaceful religious retreat, the seven clans eventually forgot their nonviolent ways and began millennia of constant warfare that racked the world. Around 100 BBY, the seven clan Mors managed to come together and forge a peace, instituting a new code of law called the Code of Ammuud that greatly regulated the planet's previously chaotic society. After generations of isolation, Ammuud joined galactic community when the Corporate Sector Authority discovered significant mineral resources under the planet's surface, and brokered a deal for mining rights in exchange for modern technology. This led to a rapid transformation of Ammuud's society, although the seven ruling clans continued their rivalries with one another."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A mountainous world in the Kumasi system, Ammuud was located on the very edge of the border of the Corporate Sector and the Wyl sector, near the end of a small hyperlane known as the Authority Arc. Ammuud's landscape included massive forests and oceans, and the world had massive polar ice caps. Although once a relatively primitive world racked by war, by 2 BBY, increasing modernization and an influx of technology had changed Ammuud into a bustling, vital society. Ammuud's main spaceport was ramshackle, with buildings largely made of wood and stone, but had a openness and activity that attracted the interest of outsiders. The settlements were built around the seven main clan strongholds, which were built deep into the planet's mountains and concealed deep, impregnable tunnels and shelters. The mountains and valleys outside Ammuud's main settlements and spaceports were largely untamed and filled with wildlife, including the graceful, carnivorous pterosaurs, who hunted large herds of grazers along with small reptiles and other mammals. The wild valleys also had cool lakes that had a high number of fish and crustaceans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ammuud was originally settled as a religious retreat by seven ships full of colonists from the Core World of Thokos, who arrived circa 10,000 BBY. Those ships wound up forming the basis of Ammuud's society for millennia, as each ship formed the basis of the world's seven founding clans: Houses Glayyd, Reesbon, Tikeris, Owphrin, Melchett, Almowri and Odoon, each of which were named after the ship they made the journey on. These seven clans were left to build a civilization completely on their own, as contact with their homeworld was soon lost, and their colonization of Ammuud forgotten entirely. For many years they managed to live together peacefully, as the settlers were devout followers of a religion that stressed nonviolence and a simple lifestyle that shunned technology. However, over the millennia, Ammuud's society became more warlike, as the descendants of those colonists forgot their religion's tranquil foundation and allowed their clan elders, or Mors, to push the clans into battle with one another."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Centuries of constant warfare ripped Ammuud asunder, and made Ammuud's seven clans more akin to militaristic nation-states. However, around 100 BBY, the seven Mors collectively realized the horrible damage the unending conflict had done to their civilization, and managed to come together to create a truce and institute a new planet-wide code of law known as the Code of Ammuud. The Code of Ammuud strictly regulated the behavior of individuals and clans, including codifying the circumstances in which violence was permitted: now, unforgivable slights were settled in duels between the two involved parties, rather than larger clan warfare. Another closely-held provision of the code was referred to as the Silence, which forbade clansmen from betraying a trust or breaking an oath\u2014the punishment for violating the Silence was to be rendered an outcast. Although it didn't erase all conflict\u2014the clans still continually engaged in intrigues and battled for position and status\u2014the Code of Ammuud created a peace that lasted over the decades to come. Republic scouts eventually rediscovered Ammuud, but the world was largely left alone until an orbital scan by the nearby Corporate Sector Authority discovered an abundance of valuable minerals beneath Ammuud's surface. In response, the Authority struck a deal that saw it provide Ammuud with modern technology in exchange for mining rights to the planet's natural resources. The Authority also allowed the clansmen to continue to practice their unique laws, albeit under Authority subcontract."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This arrangement led to a rapid transformation in daily life on Ammuud: not only did the traditions of old begin to be forgotten, but technology became extremely commonplace, with Ammuud's main spaceport soon being filled with droids and weaponry. The involvement of the Corporate Sector Authority only strengthened the clans' commitment to the Code, as it gave them further incentive to work collectively\u2014however, the Authority continually made efforts to pit the clans against one another to improve its bargaining position. That dynamic reared its head in 2 BBY, when the reigning Mor Glayyd was poisoned amidst the Glayyds' dealings with a large slaving ring. Agmor Glayyd was killed after discovering that the slavers had been making overtures to the Reesbons, and after his death, the Reesbons attempted to have the new Mor, his son Ewwen, killed as well. The Glayyds' connections with the slaving ring soon earned Ammuud a visit from several parties investigating the criminal organization, including the Corellian smuggler Han Solo. After saving the young Mor Glayyd from a certain death in a duel with the infamous gunslinger Gallandro, Solo and his confederates engaged in a battle with the slavers in the skies above Ammuud, which ended when the criminals were taken into custody by the Corporate Sector Authority."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Inhabitants"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ammuud's society was entirely descended from seven colonist ships from the planet Thokos, who formed the basis of the seven founding clans that persisted for millennia. That structure persisted in the form of a feudal-like government that persisted through the era of the Galactic Civil War, one where each individual clan was controlled by their Mor. In the years following the institution of the Code of Ammuud, the clan governments came together into a loose coalition, where each clan supplied men to the planet's security polices. Still, despite the end of outright warfare, the clans were continually competitive and tribal rivalries bitterly divided Ammuud's forces. The fortunes of the different clans rose and fell over thousands of years of constant warfare and conflict, although by the Galactic Civil War many across all seven clans had begun to dream of a different future. Notable among this new generation of citizens was Ewwen Glayyd, the young Mor of House Glayyd, who hoped to push Ammuud away from its war-torn past and later used his position to make overtures to the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ammuud first appeared in Han Solo's Revenge, a novel written by Brian Daley and released in 1979.
