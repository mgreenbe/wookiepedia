In the Security forces, he served as a sergeant under the command of Captain Savar. In 43 ABY, Carn was part of Savar's Security forces sent to apprehend Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker for failing to prevent former Jedi Knight Jacen Solo's fall to the dark side of the Force. During the arrest, former smuggler Han Solo insulted Savar, causing the captain to stiffen. One of the bounty hunters hired to assist in the arrest, the Quarren Dhidal Nyz, assumed that Skywalker was trying to use the Force on the captain, and exclaimed that the prisoner was resisting. This caused one of the troopers, Bessen, to inadvertently fire off a shot at Skywalker. The shot missed, and the situation was quickly brought under control. Savar punished Bessen, and ordered Carn to watch the trooper do two hundred push-ups and then run back to the Galactic Alliance Security blockhouse on foot. Meanwhile, the captain took Skywalker to the blockhouse via transport."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly thereafter, Jedi Knight Valin Horn, who had come down with a disease that led him to believe that everyone he knew had been replaced with an impostor, was apprehended and placed in the Jedi Temple. He escaped soon after, however, and went on a destructive rampage through Coruscant. Galactic Alliance Security forces were issued a warrant for the arrest of Horn, and Carn, again under the commanded of Savar, rushed to the scene. Horn, however, was captured by Skywalker, who had recently been released from prison. Savar and Skywalker negotiated over what to do with Horn; Skywalker thought he should go back to the Jedi Temple, whereas Savar believed that he was rightfully a prisoner of the Galactic Alliance. They eventually agreed to put him in the Mon Mothma Memorial Medical Center, which was close to equidistant between the Temple and Security headquarters. Savar ordered Carn to commandeer a civilian vehicle capable of carrying at least fifteen beings to take Horn to the Medical Center."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Carn was loyal and often eager to please his superior officer, Captain Savar.
