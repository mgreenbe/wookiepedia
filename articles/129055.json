Space mites spent their youth living on mynocks as parasites. Once they reached maturity, the creatures detached from their hosts and would rapidly develop into their adult form, reaching about one meter in length. They would then spin hardened egg cases, into which they would lay up to a dozen eggs. During the Galactic Civil War, a group of space mites nested in the computer system of the damaged 3-Z light freighter Whisper, which was situated near to the planet Korad."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
