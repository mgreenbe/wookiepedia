It hosted a native species, and attempted to remain neutral in the Galactic Civil War between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and Galactic Empire despite both sides attempting to persuade them to join. The Empire, however, got tired of Sarrahban's neutrality and launched an invasion of the world. During the battle, Alliance to Restore the Republic from the local partisan force attempted to escape aboard the Harvest Moon, a grain freighter. It was shot down by Imperial forces, but Alliance agents managed to repair the ship and escape, taking Rebel refugees and the planet's reserve of stabilized ytterbium with them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
