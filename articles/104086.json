Upon arriving, the Jedi encountered Separatist Alliance leader Count Dooku, and accused him of attacking the Brayans. Dooku denied their accusations, and introduced them to Lord Ravna, who attacked them. Dooku revealed his plans with Ravna to unleash an infestation on the galaxy, and Kenobi pleaded with him by stating that millions would die. Dooku rebutted that millions of clones would die, and revealed that he knew Peel was already turned. Eventually, upon witnessing Dooku's abilities, Ravna decided to attack him. Dooku, now slightly turned, used the dark side of the Force to prevent himself from fully converting, and used his powers to fight Ravna. Kenobi and Gallia escaped and tried to bring down the Citadel, but was destroyed by an explosion from Dooku and Ravna's fight. Ravna's curse on the infected broke after his defeat, and Peel returned to his normal self."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Peel, as a clone of Jango Fett, was a male human.
