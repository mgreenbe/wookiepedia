Though its history, Clan Vizsla counted a number of bounty hunters and warlords among their numbers. During a collapse in power of the Old Republic, the Vizsla clan was responsible for the theft of the Darksaber from the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. This unique black-bladed lightsaber would be passed down through the clan for generations, coming into possession of Pre Vizsla at some point prior to 21 BBY. Following the foundation of the pacifistic New Mandalorians in the aftermath of the Mandalorian Excision of 738 BBY, several members of the Vizsla clan joined the peaceful movement, becoming members of the New Mandalorians themselves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Perhaps the most notorious member of Clan Vizsla was the brutal soldier Tor Vizsla. In 60 BBY, Tor Vizsla and his followers broke away from the clans under the reigning Mand'alor of the time, Jaster Mereel, and formed the Death Watch splinter faction. The sigil of Clan Vizsla was taken on as the symbol of the violent and radical group, and the clan would become closely associated with the Death Watch. However, the Death Watch's opposition\u2014the Mandalorian soldiers loyal to Jaster Mereel calling themselves the True Mandalorians\u2014could count members of Clan Vizsla among their supporters. After Tor Vizsla perished at the hands of Jango Fett, Tor's Vizsla clan kinsman, Pre Vizsla, took command of the Death Watch and rebuilt it during the early years of the Clone Wars, becoming the second Vizsla clan member to lead the faction. Pre Vizsla held an ambition to restore the glory of the Vizsla clan that had faded through the years, and make the name a feared one again."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notable members"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Tor Vizsla"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tor Vizsla was a brutal, and barbaric soldier whose dreams of becoming Mand'alor and returning the Mandalorians to their conquering ways were dashed by the ascension of fellow Mandalorian, Jaster Mereel, to the position. Mereel's attempts to return a sense of honor to the increasingly dishonorable Mandalorian mercenaries was met with objection from Tor, who gathered to him a group of like-minded warriors who had enjoyed their lives of unaccountability prior to Mereel's claim to the title of Mand'alor. Under Tor, the Death Watch was formed, and he led his troops through the Mandalorian Civil War against Jaster Mereel's loyal \"True Mandalorians\". Tor personally killed Mereel on Korda Six, and through his machinations, led the supercommandos of the True Mandalorians to their deaths on the planet Galidraan, at the hands of a Jedi strike team. Years later, however, Tor would meet the same fate courtesy of Jaster Mereel's adopted son, Jango Fett, who hunted Tor to Corellia and left the wounded Death Watch leader to be killed by a pack of dire-cats following a lengthy fight."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Pre Vizsla"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pre Vizsla grew up in an era of Mandalorian history wherein the peaceful New Mandalorians were the dominant faction, but Pre yearned for the New Mandalorians' downfall and a return to the widespread warrior ways of the past. Having become the governor of Mandalore's moon, Concordia, Pre was publicly a supporter of the New Mandalorian government and of its leader, Duchess Satine Kryze. In secret, however, he despised Kryze, her government, and everything they stood for, leading the Death Watch against those he considered to be a disgrace to all Mandalorians. Pre revealed himself and his intentions during a battle with the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, and tried to kill the Duchess as part of a Separatist-backed plot to take over control of Mandalore from the New Mandalorians. Two years later, Pre was aided by the Sith Lord Darth Maul, his apprentice Savage Opress, and their Shadow Collective of gangsters in a successful coup against the New Mandalorian government. Overthrowing Duchess Kryze, Vizsla betrayed his Sith allies but was killed by Maul in a confrontation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Vizsla clan can find its creative roots in the 2002 comic book series, Jango Fett: Open Seasons, wherein the character of Tor Vizsla first appeared, but only as \"Vizsla\". The Essential Atlas, released seven years later in 2009, finally provided him with the first name of \"Tor\". Later, in 2010, the television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars introduced the Death Watch leading character of Pre Vizsla, taking the surname from the previous Death Watch leader.
