The Galactic Republic took great interest in the accident due to the Separatist ship's cargo: the toxin Trihexalophine1138. As the contaminant spread, it ravaged the planet and desiccated most of its flora. Over the next few months, plains and jungles died, forcing the Noghri to trek across the planet in a mass exodus, searching for a place where they could survive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Within weeks of the end of the war, Darth Vader arrived at Honoghr, and promptly found his stormtrooper guards slaughtered around him by the natives\u2014with nothing more than primitive bladed weapons\u2014impressing the Dark Lord greatly. In exchange for the Galactic Empire working to restore the planet's ecosystem, the Noghri gave homage to Vader and pledged to serve him as assassins\u2014the Death Commandos. In reality, the Imperial restoration teams deliberately kept Honoghr poisoned using a hybrid grass that killed off the remaining plant life, thus keeping the Noghri bound in the service of the Empire. The planet had also been used as a training ground for Vader's secret apprentices of Galen Marek (codenamed Starkiller) and Tao, as well as for Ennix Devian, which involved dropping them onto the planet unarmed and having to evade and defeat a Noghri hunting party."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not long before the Battle of Yavin a Zann Consortium ground force led by Urai Fen arrived on Honoghr, to kill Commander Malinth and intimidate the Noghri. The Noghri helped the Empire to try to repel the invaders, but were ultimately beaten and their dwellings destroyed. Malinth was killed and the Noghri proved unable to defeat them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, during the Thrawn crisis in 9 ABY, Leia Organa Solo arrived at Honoghr and, using her position as the daughter and heir of Darth Vader and having discovered the Empire's trickery, persuaded the Noghri to relinquish their allegiance to the Empire. The Noghri were freed from their enslavement and became members of the New Republic and its successor government the Galactic Alliance. The Noghri were represented in the New Republic Senate by Kahr'corvh of Clan Kihm'bar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leia and her entire family also became very highly respected figures in Noghri society.

Taking into account that Leia visited in 9 ABY, this piece of information implies it happened around 35 BBY. The Essential Guide to Alien Species retconned this by saying that the year on Honoghr is shorter than usual time on other planets. However, in Dark Force Rising, the maitrakh states \"Forty-eight Noghri years. In years of the Emperor, forty-four,\" indicating the maitrakh already understood that there was a differential between Honoghr years and that of Galactic standard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
