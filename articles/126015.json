After studying Galactic Republic technology in isolation in the Waymancy Hollow for a thousand years, the Sisters of the Machinesmith produced the extremely efficient power generators used by the Signatories of Waymancy during the Waymancy Storm, a short, destructive war with the Republic in 7811 BBY. These generators allowed Waymancy pulse-wave weapons to be more powerful and have much faster rates of fire than anything known by the Republic Military at the time of the Subterra Period."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
