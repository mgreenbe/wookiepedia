Around five years before the Battle of Yavin, the members of the squad were undergoing a two week orientation course at the academy and took part in a training exercise which required them to board a Sentinel-class landing craft. Once the four girls were on board, two of their number cheered as the shuttle took off, which earned them a scolding from Sergeant Currahee, one of their instructors. One of the cadets in the unit named Illorus later failed to complete the second objective of a combat exercise Forn took part in, resulting in her dismissal from the academy. Commandant Cumberlayne Aresko later asked Currahee why Illorus was absent from the squad, after which cadets from other academies across Lothal were transferred in to fill the gaps left in Forn and other cadet units by those who had left the academy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
