Jabba's majordomo promises them soft living at the famous Hutt's palace. However, upon arrival, Oola is dismayed to discover that Tatooine is a horridly hot and desert planet, a discovery alleviated only by her dreams of lush luxury at Jabba's palace. Fortuna leaves the two dancers momentarily, during which absence they encounter Luke Skywalker, who warns them against serving Jabba. Oola's friend flees with Skywalker, but Oola herself remains, jealously thinking she can thus ensure Jabba's patronage for herself alone. However, once at the palace, Oola learns how mistaken she is. Fortunately for her, hope is renewed when she learns from C-3PO that Luke Skywalker is planning a rescue for another prisoner at the palace. Heartened anew, Oola accepts Jabba's demand for her to dance, vowing to herself that this shall be her greatest dance yet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
