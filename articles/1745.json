It provided protection for the head and the torso and thus covered fewer body parts than did most other regular battle armor types, but, in turn, it was more maneuverable than most other personal battle armor models on the market. The popular battle armor had two major flaws though. Firstly, its systems were rather antiquated, and, secondly, while light enough not to hinder land-based movement, its protective parts severely handicapped one's swimming capabilities.
