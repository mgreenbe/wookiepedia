He was observed using his underwater lightsaber on during the first and second battles of Mon Calamari. He would later record in the Great Holocron an explanation of how the pulse worked, and instructions on how to modify lightsabers to add the feature. His modification became widely used by Jedi Knights during the Clone Wars, where battles were fought on the water worlds of Kamino and Dac."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ancient lightsaber that Anja Gallandro had bought and formerly owned was waterproof, as was Cilghal's. Luke Skywalker would discover that Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber was waterproof. Ahsoka Tano's lightsaber and shoto were both able to function underwater. By 24 ABY, Luke's Jedi Praxeum students had already created lightsabers with the pulse as part of their regular design, rather than as an optional choice."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
