He was a fat, red-faced Human male who enjoyed smoking cigarras. His office was often full of smoke as he puffed away. He was an short-tempered man and often shouted at his employees. When his subordinate, Felben Cuplatt informed him that one of their shipments of Rodian flame silk had been taken by privateers who claimed to be working for the Galactic Empire he was furious, especially after Felben told him that the X-Wings that had been escorting their ships were being withdrawn by the New Republic. He wanted the privateers to pay and came up with the idea to hire cheap mercenaries, which he dubbed 'freelance marines' to guard their shipments and capture or kill the privateers when they attempted to board."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Crizby Rubmo was created by Thomas Bowling for the article Droids Defiant that was published in Star Wars Adventure Journal 9 in February 1996.
