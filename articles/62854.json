The bounty hunters were not only specialized in hunting murderers, but also in delivering dead captures: Never in the history of Paramexor a living prisoner was delivered."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A hunter working for House Paramexor had to pay a fee of 300 annual credits, plus a 3% of the monetary value of any collected bounty. Besides, a prospective hunter had to be sponsored by three members to join the House. The main headquarters of the House was on the planet Denevar, and hunters of Paramexor commonly traveled through the Core Worlds and nearby areas.

Any injured party, including non-members, could claim satisfaction by defying the hunter. If verdict said so, this could lead to a duel where injured party and hunters would use short swords.

Being restricted to a mobile life support unit, Janq Paramexor could not hunt bounties himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, House Paramexor included 623 active bounty hunters and 1,740 support personnel. Wanting to provide personalized attention, Paramexor decided to keep the total number of hunters under one thousand, and insisted to give them all the luxuries he could afford. He thus obtained a great loyalty among his employees, who would be glad to fight to death for him. Paramexor refused to expand his activities to other specializations beyond tracking murderers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1 ABY, House Paramexor had become one of the ten main houses of the Bounty Hunter's Guild, with it's trademark being well-known.

Kal-tan-shi owned a Ghtroc Class 720 freighter, the Accuser that House Paramexor was customizing and modifying. Having had a successful career in the House, Kal-tan-shi left the Guild and turned to work on his own; he took his starship with him even if the modifications had not been completed. After leaving Paramexor, Kal-tan-shi kept his friendship with the Guildmaster and they dined out together at times."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The female Reson Nath, member of the House and known as a contemptuous individual, paid an infochant who then left the planet to the chagrin of Imperial Prefect Adar.
