Built in honor of the deceased Mand'alor, Fenn Shysa, it existed as one of only a few memorials ever erected on the Outer Rim world. During the Second Galactic Civil War, Fett came to the memorial often to speak with Shysa, something he had only previously done with his deceased father, Jango Fett."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fenn Shysa's memorial was a simple one, consisting of the former Mand'alor's helmet resting atop a column of granite and secured by a durasteel peg. Shysa had been a beloved leader to his people, and no Mandalorian would think to steal or dislodge his helmet; the durasteel peg was placed there only as a precaution to thwart bad weather and Mandalore's native wildlife. Located in the small Keldabe suburb of Bralsin, the memorial sat at the crest of a small hill, in a clearing surrounded by an avenue of trees. It was a small substitute for a proper Mand'alor's grave, but Boba Fett personally considered it fitting for a humble, populist leader like Shysa, to be commemorated like any other Mandalorian. There was no name, inscription, or markings on the monument, and no railings or other indicator that it was a respected leader who was being honored at the site. The memorial itself went undisturbed for at least twenty years, surviving the attack of the Yuuzhan Vong during the Yuuzhan Vong War, though by 41 ABY, the helmet had begun to succumb to rust and the paint had started to noticeably fade."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, the Mandalorian soldier Fenn Shysa and two-hundred and eleven other Mandalorian Protectors attacked the cloning facilities on the watery world of Kamino on behalf of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, devastating them. Though the majority of the Protectors were later killed in the fateful Battle of Norval II, Shysa survived and his deeds did not go unforgotten. Several years later, when the infamous bounty hunter Boba Fett went to Kamino to have his cancerous leg transplanted for a new, cloned one, the Kaminoan Taun We hired Fett to kill Shysa in revenge for what he and his comrades had done to Kamino. Fett hunted Shysa\u2014who had by that point become the Mand'alor, leader of the Mandalorian clans\u2014eventually confronting him on the planet Shogun. There, they were attacked by the Sevvets and Shysa gave his life to protect Fett. Shysa had wanted Fett to be Mand'alor for decades, desiring to capitalize on his father Jango Fett's reputation as a killer of Jedi as symbol of strength for Mandalore, and begged Fett to assume the role as his dying wish. Honoring Shysa's last request, Fett became the new Mand'alor, and though he left Shysa's body behind in the Quence sector, he returned to Mandalore with Shysa's green and red-colored helmet. There, in the small settlement of Bralsin, a rural suburb of the planet's capital city, Keldabe, Fett created a simple memorial displaying Shysa's helmet on a column of granite secured by a durasteel peg."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The memorial survived the Yuuzhan Vong's attack on Mandalore during their invasion of the galaxy unharmed, remaining undisturbed for close to twenty years. During the conflict between the Galactic Alliance and the Confederation, Boba Fett visited Shysa's memorial on a number of occasions, a stark contrast to the nearly twenty years previous when Fett had never bothered to visit the simple monument. There, he would stand and speak to the rusting helmet and imagine Shysa's replies, something he had only previously done with his father, Jango. Fett's long-time friend Goran Beviin later brought Jedi Knight Jaina Solo to Shysa's memorial during at least one of their training sessions together. While there, Beviin told Solo of Shysa's connection to her mother, Leia Organa Solo, and her uncle, Luke Skywalker, with whom Shysa had fought alongside against the Galactic Empire and its later remnants. The two paid their respects to the beloved Mand'alor\u2014Beviin even fondly rubbing Shysa's old helmet, and offering to record a holoimage for Solo's mother, the former Princess Leia\u2014then carried on with their lessons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fenn Shysa's memorial first appeared in Star Wars canon in the 2008 novel, Legacy of the Force: Revelation, by author Karen Traviss.
