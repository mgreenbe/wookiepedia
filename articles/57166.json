Specifically to rise to the rank of Commerce Master Commissioner of the VFCZ he carefully spread favors among all the Imperial officials who had a stake in the Velcar Free Commerce Zone."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 7 ABY, he attended the Pentastar Talks, and despite believing the VFCZ was in good order, recognized the need to align with a party to avoid being absorbed into the New Republic.

In reality, he was a shrewd businessman, keeping the VFCZ in good financial order despite the collapse of the Galactic Empire. He was not above corruption and often brokered deals in the VFCZ for his own personal profit. He lived luxuriously on Capza.
