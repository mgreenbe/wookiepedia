Lom Pyke was contacted by a man named Tyranus who wished to have Sifo-Dyas killed, and they secretly negotiated a deal. Sifo-Dyas was called off Oba Diah by the Jedi Council to assist in a tribal dispute on Felucia. As he left the moon, Sifo-Dyas' ship was shot down by Pykes, who delivered Sifo-Dyas' body to Tyranus, but kept Silman, who they had found still alive in the wreckage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 20 BBY Pyke approached Darth Maul on Zanbar at the new Death Watch camp, and he stated that he knew that Maul was forming an army. He then said that he had no desire to oppose Maul in any way and that he wanted to join the Shadow Collective."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pyke and the Pyke Syndicate forces were instrumental in the eventual takeover of Sundari, the New Mandalorian capital city, after he joined Maul's criminal organization. In Sundari, Pyke was a part of a small strike team that included Savage Opress and attacked and destroyed the Mandalore Banking Center. Pyke's team was ultimately stopped by Pre Vizsla himself, and Pyke and Opress were presented to the people of Sundari as prisoners. Pyke managed to escape from custody, though, and he returned to his home planet, Oba Diah."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lom Pyke later received an unexpected visit from Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, who sought the truth about the death of Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. Pyke agreed to help the Jedi only after they noticed him wearing the insignia of the former Chancellor, Finis Valorum; the criminal brought them to Silman, whom he had kept as a hostage as a bargaining chip. He gave the Jedi access to Silman in exchange for amnesty concerning their betrayal of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To tie up loose ends regarding his role in the murder of Sifo-Dyas, Count Dooku traveled to Oba Diah, where he killed Silman and dueled Anakin and Obi-Wan. The two Jedi were aided by the Pykes. Lom Pyke declared to Dooku that he had no more business with the Pykes, addressing him as \"Tyranus,\" alerting the Jedi to Dooku's Sith name. In the ensuing fight, Obi-Wan and Anakin attempted to use a Force push against Dooku, but he dodged the attack and it ended up knocking Lom Pyke and his men over. The disarmed Pyke was swiftly killed by Dooku."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
