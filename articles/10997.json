Unlike the Imperial Death Stars' superlasers, this cannon of the Final Order was capable of firing a red beam in a sustained burst to strike through a planet's surface from orbit, where the energy beam would delve deeper by pulsating at a fast rate, unleashing shock waves of crust-and-mantle-tearing energy, eventually reaching the planet's core and ripping the target apart. Such power, however, required the superlaser to be directly connected to the Star Destroyer's reactor, and severe damage to such weaponry would destroy its host ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kijimi\u2014a planet with an estimated population of 310,000,000\u2014 was a victim of such a weapon, specifically the one affixed to the Derriphan, one of many Xyston-class Star Destroyers at the disposal of the Sith fleet.
