Poen caught Rebel Alliance agent Gregor Lojan in the act of spying, and ordered stormtroopers to chase Lojan. Eventually, Lojan was captured, and Poen arrived shortly after. As Lojan was being arrested, an ISB major arrived, who was actually a high-level Rebel operative. The major congratulated Poen, and took the opportunity to pat down Lojan, handing him a Class 3 detonite microcharge and relaying his next orders. After the pat down, Poen thanked the major for the assistance, unaware that the major and Lojen were accomplices."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
