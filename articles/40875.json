Odile Vaiken, the Human who founded the new Imperial Military, led a military campaign into the wild jungle in order to clear the wilderness and make way for the Empire's capital, Kaas City.

In 3954 BBY Revan, his memory wiped, found his way to the Emperor's homeworld of Nathema, where he was captured by the Dark Councilor Darth Nyriss and the Sith Lord Scourge. Nyriss and Scourge were part of a conspiracy against the Emperor, and so Nyriss imprisoned Revan in her own estate on Dromund Kaas, with the Emperor unaware that he had returned. Four years later, Revan's protege Meetra Surik went in search of Revan and found Dromund Kaas. She rescued Revan, and they allied with Scourge.
