Bold served in the Galactic Empire during the Imperial Period and was known to be one of the best cadets at the Imperial Academy. During the time of the First Galactic Civil War, Bold learned of what happened to Alderaan and how it was destroyed by the Empire. She viewed the Empire to be tyrannical and decided to join the Rebel Alliance, serving with Red Squadron. In 4 ABY, Bold flew a T-65 X-wing starfighter and participated in the Battle of Endor, engaging Imperial starfighters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dorovio Bold started out as an unnamed pilot filmed for Return of the Jedi, portrayed by actress Vivienne Chandler. Her photo was revealed years later on StarWars.com's Hyperspace, and she was later named in The Complete Visual Dictionary. Footage of Chandler filming scenes in the cockpit for the battle suggests that she was one of the pilots making the final assault on the Death Star, and that she would have been killed when her fighter suffered fatal stabilizer damage. That footage was finally released in 2013 in the digital edition of The Making of Return of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bold's helmet first appeared as Luke Skywalker's blast shield helmet in A New Hope, and the prop was again reused as Darnell Reggs' helmet in the Rebel Assault II: The Hidden Empire video game.
