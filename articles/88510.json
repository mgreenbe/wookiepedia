Tills traveled back from the Senate with Padm\u00e9 Amidala, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano to inspect the situation. When Amidala informed the Senate that the situation had become a full scale civil war, the Republic sent aide and thousands of troops in the form of a company of clone SCUBA troopers and the Gungan Grand Army. However, the situation worsened and Tills, along with Char's few remaining loyal followers, were captured and imprisoned.
