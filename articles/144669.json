It dawns on him that the plans are likely in that escape pod, and he comes for Arvira's help for fear of getting in trouble for not realizing this earlier. Arvira gives Bolvan several forms to fill out in order to cover up the gunnery officer's late revelation, in exchange for some later favors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
