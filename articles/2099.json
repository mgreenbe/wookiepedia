At the time of the early stages of the Yuuzhan Vong invasion, Soolehad went by the pseudonym Falloon so as to avoid capture. The Rodian employed a team of mercenaries to get him off planet Sriluur, after 9T-LOM was targeted for destruction by a group of Yuuzhan Vong. Soolehad later turned over the information in the LOM unit over to a group of Black Sun leaders for a good profit on Coruscant. This was in effort to safeguard over a century's worth of Black Sun financial records stored in the memory banks of the droid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
