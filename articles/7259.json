To distinguish between the two species, xenobiologists referred to the Ret as Annoo-dat Blue and the original Annoo-dat as Annoo-dat Prime, however the Annoo-dat did not use such terminology."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Agriculture on Annoo became highly industrialized on the southern continent (the northern continent remaining much as it always had) and the Tra'ang'a language of the Ret fell out of use, all Annoo-dat speaking Dat-an."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In about 27 BBY, General Ashaar Khorda attempted a bloody coup, but he was defeated by the Galactic Republic forcing him to go into hiding."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the early years of the Galactic Empire, the notorious crime lord, Sise Fromm, had a stronghold on Annoo from where the Fromm Gang plotted the takeover of the other major gangs.
