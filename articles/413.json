The troopers were equipped with Phase II clone trooper armor with light yellow markings and DC-15A blaster carbines. The battalion was led by Jedi General Jaro Tapal and a Clone Commander who was outfitted with the same gear as the standard clone troopers of the battalion. Tapal's Padawan, Cal Kestis, also served in the battalion. The 13th Battalion was headquartered on the Venator-class Star Destroyer Albedo Brave. Several members of a separate military unit led by Jedi General Chiata had the same color scheme of the 13th Battalion.

On the way, Kestis spoke with several clone troopers on topics such as having rematches, rumors of their next deployment, and whether Kestis was on his way to training.

The Clone Commander raised his blaster ready to shoot Tapal, when Tapal activated his lightsaber and cut the blaster and then slashed across the clone's stomach, killing him. Although Kestis was confused, Tapal told him that the clones had betrayed them. Tapal then instructed Kestis to get to the Albedo Brave's escape pods to escape the ship, but to use the maintenance halls and that they would rendezvous there along with further instructions. Other clone troopers then began blasting their way into the control room while the two Jedi parted ways.

A clone then instructed his fellow soldiers to hold the room while he searched the area. After Kestis reached another area of the ship, the clones below him reported to others that there were casualties and that Tapal had destroyed several squads. While Kestis continued, the clones discovered that there was someone in the maintenance halls and explosions erupted throughout the vessel. Sometime during the skirmish, Tapal overloaded the ship's main reactor. Kestis then reached an area with turbolifts, which were damaged after several explosions. After moving in the area, a clone trooper spotted Kestis and reported to his comrades and began firing. Kestis then encountered two more troopers which began firing on him, and in the fight Kestis lost his lightsaber, although Tapal arrived and killed the clones by pushing them off the doorway and into the turbolift shaft.

Once Kestis unlocked the override, Tapal moved from one hallway to another, killing several other clone troopers. Kestis eventually arrived at the escape pod bay, when he confronted two troopers. Tapal arrived simultaneously and dispatched the two troopers, although a large group of Republic forces soon converged on their location from a central hallway. Tapal defended Kestis as he opened the door, but was eventually wounded by the barrage of blaster fire.  After a final attempt to protect Kestis, Tapal used the Force against the clones but was hit by another barrage of laser fire, and fell backwards into the pod. Kestis used Force Stasis to freeze the clones and allow time to escape.
