The weapon was believed to function on a sub-molecular level by disrupting the subatomic bonds that held neutrons together within atoms. This would have, theoretically, resulted in matter simply 'melting', the resulting damage, at least as inflicted upon organic matter and living beings, would resemble damaged scar tissue."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Presumably this technology was used by a scouting force of Yuuzhan Vong warships, as the damage they inflicted upon Zonama Sekot matched what neutron dissemblers were believed to create."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
