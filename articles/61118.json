Near the end of the attack, she engaged in battle with the Alliance Commander and Rass Ordo, and was defeated. However, upon learning that her followers had secured the banner of Clan Cadera, she pulled out and retreated from the fight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the battle, she met with representatives of the three groups that had joined her, which included Tyrus Brokenblade, Bask Sunn, and Durn Wynnward, as well as a number of members from each group. Upon hearing them arguing with each other, Kol pulled out a thermal detonator and tossed it down towards Brokenblade, who managed to catch it in his hand and prevent it from exploding, so long as he kept his hand on it. Kol claimed that they could only truly accomplish their goals if they were working together. To prove this point, she stabbed Brokenblade twice to show that they all needed to rely on each other. She then dismissed everyone to fulfill the orders given to them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
