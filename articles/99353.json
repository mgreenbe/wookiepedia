As a Chalhuddan, they would experience five genders throughout their lifetime. In 3 BBY, Princess Leia Organa traveled to Chal Hudda on a humanitarian mission to deliver vaccines to the Chalhuddan people. Due to a cultural difference, Quentto initially refused Organa's offer to help due to their belief that Organa was showing pity instead of respecting the Chalhuddans' strength and independence. Quentto was persuaded when Organa honestly expressed her frustration with Quentto's pride. They accepted the vaccines with Organa's agreement to approach the Chalhuddans as an equal by someday asking for a favor in return."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Organa needed to reach the Paucris system to warn a group of rebels that the Galactic Empire planned to investigate the system, Organa called upon Quentto for her favor. She requested transport for herself and Amilyn Holdo to the system, warned Quentto of the danger that would be involved, and said it would put her in their debt. Quentto was pleased to grant the favor and someday ask for one in return, and said that Organa now understood their people."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
