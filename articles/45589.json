The tower was situated near the Funeral Temple in Naboo's capital city of Theed. The flame, easily visible from the whole city, was a constant reminder to the Naboo of their own mortality and their duty to live in harmony. During funeral processions, the mourners used to gather around the Eternal Flame for a moment of contemplation, shortly after the cremation of the dead in the Funeral Temple."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
