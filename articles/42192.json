It was working on a moisture vaporator shortly before the annual Boonta Eve Classic podrace of the year 32 BBY. EG-9 was cobbled together from at least three different models of droids, including a salvaged Temirca droid head with a broken antenna, a Montoro serving drone body, repair worker arms, and wheels scavenged from a Verpine G9 droid. It was given an orange paint job with silver highlights for maximum visibility, and had gray photoreceptors. EG-9 had a broken antenna attached to the left side of its head."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "EG-9 was originally created for the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.

When the Republic cruiser Radiant VII arrives carrying Jedi ambassadors Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi shortly before the Invasion of Naboo, EG-9 and fellow worker droid PK-4 watch the docking bay from a nearby hallway. PK-4 assumes the Jedi are important when Viceroy Nute Gunray sends TC-14, whom the droids consider a \"useless protocol gearhead,\" to greet them.
