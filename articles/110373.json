Shortly after, the ship jumped into hyperspace to return to Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the execution of Order 66, G-G, along with fellow astromech droids R7-A7 and CH-33P, agreed to assist Tano after she came looking for help upon evading execution by Clone Commander CT-7567 and his men. The astromech aided Tano in her apprehension of Rex by helping the other two droids stop him and trap him between blast doors. R7 shocked Rex unconscious after Tano revealed herself to him, and the droids carried him to the medical bay, where he could be operated on and have his inhibitor chip removed. While the procedure was ongoing, since the other clones were attempting to break into the room, Tano ordered G-G to be ready to re-seal the door. The clones did eventually manage to get the door open, but G-G was eventually able to close it again before assisting Cheep in welding the door shut."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Hangar and destruction"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ahsoka, Rex, and the droids fought their way out of the medical bay in order to reach the hangar of the Star Destroyer. Once reaching the command center of the hangar, Ahsoka ordered G-G to find out what had happened to the Venator by accessing the computer. G-G subsequently informed them that the hyperdrive had been destroyed: unbeknownst to Tano and Rex, this had been done by Maul, who Tano had earlier released from the detention block as a distraction. The droid also revealed that the doomed Star Destroyer, which had subsequently fallen out of hyperspace, was now caught in the gravitational pull of a nearby moon. Meanwhile, R7-A7 opened the doors to Bay 12 and revealed a large amount of clones, led by Clone Lieutenant CT-5597, waiting for them in the hangar.

Maul knocked Ahsoka off balance and she nearly fell into the opening created by the lowered platforms, however G-G caught her with a suction cup and attempted to pull her up. As Ahsoka was occupied, Maul entered the shuttle and managed to almost fly out of the hangar before Ahsoka pulled him back with the Force. She managed to hold onto the shuttle for several moments before letting him go in order to defend Rex.
