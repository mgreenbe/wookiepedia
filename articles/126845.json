After these recruitment missions, the group decided to take a break to visit Chewbacca's family on Kashyyyk. Arriving on the planet, the group felt a sense of uneasiness about Rwookrrorro. With Chewbacca leading the way, they made their way to Chewbacca's home."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the way the group's path to the house was blocked by a strange alien who identified himself as Knife. Knife was curiously unconcerned with the group's presence, even when Chewbacca's temper got the better of him and he yelled into the alien's face. Knife was accompanied by Vargi, Chewbacca's brother-in-law who suggested that everyone should go to Chewbacca's house for refreshments. Arrival at the tree house brought another curious turn of events when none of Chewbacca's family were present to greet Chewbacca."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The group decided to wait for Chewbacca's family to return, and as they shared drinks with one another Lando and Han began to question Knife's true intentions for being on Kashyyyk. Their questions were soon answered when Chewbacca's son Lumpy returned home alone. Rogue Wookiees under Knife's command took Lumpy as a hostage and held the Alliance members at blasterpoint. Knife revealed that he also had taken Chewbacca's wife Mallatobuck captive and he made plans to parade Chewbacca through Kashyyyk, to eventually place him on a slaver's ship. Lando and Han were left as prisoners within Chewbacca's home under guard by several Wookiees."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Knife escorted Chewbacca from his house, Han and Lando immediately began to tinker with their cuffs. Lando managed to get their chains loosened, and the two escaped from their captors. While Han tried to keep Chewbacca from being brought onto a slaving ship, Lando made his way back to their ships to send a distress call to the Alliance and bring back weapons to aid with a resistance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Han sneaked behind the enemy and released Chewbacca's restraints. Unfortunately, Chewbacca's captors realized what was happening and trained their weapons on Chewbacca and Han. Vargi dragged Chewbacca aside and proceeded to beat him for his attempt to escape. Han could not bear to see Chewbacca being unmercifully beaten and struck Vargi. With his attention now on Han, Vargi's fury was turned away from Chewbacca and his beating recommenced but with Han as the victim."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Lando had returned with weapons and armed the Wookiees still loyal to the Alliance. As the newly armed group prepared to ambush their enemies, Chewbacca once again broke free and began to attack Vargi. Realizing that Chewbacca's outburst was disrupting the loading of Wookiees onto the slave ships, Knife prepared to kill Chewbacca with a tehk'la blade, but the weapon was shot out of his hand by Lando."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Wookiees overthrew their rogue counterparts just as Chewbacca was able to overpower Vargi, throwing him to the ground. Han had been knocked unconscious by Vargi's furious assault, and he woke up just in time to see Knife escaping from the battlefield."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The slaving ring that Knife had hoped to establish on Kashyyyk was dismantled, but the Nagai Commander was able to escape. Stealing Lando's ship the Cobra, Knife sped back to the Nagai headquarters. The Wookiees who had assisted Knife were likely placed into Alliance custody. While Vargi was shamed for his part in the operation, he was also disowned by his sister Malla, and she would later claim that he was no longer her brother."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The destruction of the slaving ring marked the last attempt by the Nagai to create a slaving operation in Alliance space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
