The prison was protected from the planet's high gravity atmosphere by a gravity shield operated by an orbiting space station. Prisoners were given supplies and left to fend for themselves.

Terex offered to help the three crime lords escape offworld on his ship Carrion Spike if they helped him to kill Grakkus' guards, the Resistance starfighter pilot Poe Dameron and his Black Squadron. Terex planned to kill Grakkus for reneging on an earlier deal after extracting the information from him. After Terex threw a knife on the table, Isin and his fellow crime lords agreed to the plan. Isin remarked that it was \"time to kill.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Isin, his fellow crime lords and Terex watched the assault. When Terex reminded them that he wanted to kill Dameron personally, Isin responded that he could not make any promises since his men were killers driven by blood lust. Despite a ferocious assault, Dameron managed to outmaneuver Terex and his allies by getting Black Squadron's astromech droids including BB-8 to deactivate the gravity shield. While Black Squadron escaped with Grakkus, Isin and his fellow gangsters were pinned to the ground by the high gravity. When Isin heard Toren weeping, Be explained that one of his Ximpi had crashed to the ground when the grav field shut off. Terex managed to escape by summoning his ship. When Terex abandoned them to die for their failure, Isin cursed him and told him that he would die for this."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Isin was a male Advozse crime lord who commanded a posse.
