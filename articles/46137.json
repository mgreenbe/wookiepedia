The New Republic representatives on the voyage were Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, his wife Mara Jade Skywalker and Dean Jinzler, a mechanic, who posed himself as a New Republic diplomat. They were also joined by Unit Aurek-Seven from the 501st Legion of the Empire of the Hand and a group of aliens calling themselves Geroon, but who in truth were Vagaari seeking the destruction of the Chiss."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Background"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 27 BBY the Galactic Republic sent out an expedition known as the Outbound Flight Project in attempt to spread outside the galaxy.
