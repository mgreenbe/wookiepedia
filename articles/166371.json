In circa 31 BBY, Kak was present on the planet Cularin, where he was staying in the Chancellor's suite at the Reidi Artom Luxury Resort in the city Gadrin. After the Sullustan Salld Nrump obtained evidence of the existence of three data transmitters that the Cartel had covertly placed on Cularin, Nrump gave a datapad containing his findings to the Heroes of Cularin, a group of freelance agents who operated in the Cularin system. Kak contacted the agents on the behalf of the Cartel via a holographic recording contained within a messenger droid, stating that he was authorized to pay them  20,000 if they handed the datapad in to the Cartel and did not inform the media of its contents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The agents accepted Kak's offered and they gave him the datapad, and he paid them 20,000 credits in return.
