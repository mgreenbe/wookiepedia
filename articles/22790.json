Morr, the Nautolan apprentice of the Jedi Master Orgus Din, had disappeared during the Sacking of Coruscant in 3653 BBY by the Sith Empire, and he had gone insane over the course of the next ten years. Morr taught Callef that the Jedi Order had become weak and useless, and that it should be destroyed and rebuilt into something stronger."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 3643 BBY, Callef and Morr made their move on the Jedi homeworld of Tython. In their quest to overthrow the Jedi Order, he and his master instigated an uprising amongst the native Flesh Raiders, and used the bestial natives as soldiers while they directed from the shadows. Using a secret tunnel connecting the Tythos Ridge and the Tythonian Gnarls, Callef led an invasion force of Flesh Raiders into the Gnarls against the Jedi's base there. A Bith Jedi apprentice by the name of Unaw Aharo had noticed the increased Flesh Raider activity in the area and reported his findings to Jedi Master Derrin Weller. However, Aharo was captured by Callef's forces not long after sending his message, and they brought the wounded and disarmed Bith before the Dark Jedi in the cave."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Callef began to question Aharo, who was shocked to see that the Human carried a lightsaber. However, a young Padawan interrupted Callef before he could kill the Bith, having defeated the Flesh Raider soldiers who had been guarding the cave. The Jedi apprentice's martial skill sparked the Dark Jedi's interest, but Callef was confident in his abilities and summoned two Flesh Raider guards, attacking the Padawan.

Later on, the Padawan would be contacted by Callef's master Bengel Morr, who expressed his disappointment that Callef was defeated so easily.

He was fluent in Basic and able to understand the language of the Bith people, as well as the guttural language of the Flesh Raiders. Callef was arrogant and cruel, believing in survival of the fittest, and he despised what he saw as passivity and weakness on the part of the Jedi Order. Like his master Bengel Morr, Callef desired the destruction of the Jedi Order so that the pair could rebuild it in accordance with their own beliefs.

He is the first boss fought by the Jedi Knight character, as part of the player's first class quest \"Attack of the Flesh Raiders.\" Players can choose to attack Callef in the middle of their conversation for dark side points, or ask for Callef's surrender for light-side points. As the Jedi Knight is a Republic character, it is assumed that the Knight chooses only light-side options. As part of an April Fool's joke in 2011, several cinematics from the game were released on The Old Republic's website with vocalization in Shyriiwook, the language of the Wookiee species. One of the videos showed the events of the mission \"Weapon of the Jedi,\" in which players confront Bengel Morr, but the video showed Callef in Morr's place."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
