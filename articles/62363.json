Once they secured the corridor, he ordered the remaining platoon to scavenge for power paks and make a makeshift wall of droid parts before blowing the door at the end. Another fight ensued behind the door, and the Rebel presence was all but eliminated when Katarn ordered to stop firing, surprising Hong. Katarn hid his unwillingness to commit a massacre, saying that they don't need to waste their ammo on Rebels who surrendered."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two-thirds of the original platoon that survived looked for the communications room, and Hong reprimanded Dendu for wasting ammo in his attempt to shoot a maintenance droid.

He complied, under protest, and ordered Jonsey and Haku to pull the memory modules and set explosive charges."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hong and the rest were barricated in the cafeteria waiting to be rescued by reinforcements; they didn't expect that the Rebels would drill into the wall; Hong was killed once Rebels poured from the drilled hole."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hong was small in body but had a storng voice.
