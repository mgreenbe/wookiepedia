To Humans, they appeared to be a tangle of limbs with the occasional eye peeping out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rugjha could become talented musicians, partly because they could play ten or more instruments at once. Among the most famous Rugjha musicians were Umjing Baab and His Swinging Trio (though Baab was considered a part of this trio, as he only had two fellow members in the band.) Though they could play instrumental music which humanoids could hear and enjoy, they did not sing to them, as their natural voices were inaudible to most humanoids. Rugjha used artificial mechanisms to speak Basic to Humans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
