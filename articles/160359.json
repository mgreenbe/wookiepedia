They used a bola-like weapon, a long rope with stones tied to each end, to trip the large, elephantine Pryss-creatures. During the Galactic Civil War, Rebel Alliance tactician Beryl Chiffonage, inspired by the Verig nomads' primitive, yet effective, hunting strategy, designed a similar tactic for use by T-47 airspeeders against Imperial All Terrain Armored Transport walkers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chiffonage's tactic later resulted in the downing of several AT-ATs during the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY.
