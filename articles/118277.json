The asteroid did not have an atmosphere and many of the colonists never went on to the surface or saw stars. Eventually, Ryland married a woman named Fiona, whom he described as a far superior mechanic than he was, and who understood machines better than even their original designers. Ryland and Fiona were the parents of a baby girl named Laina. Their foreman ,Corbin,for did not have a family before working at the mine and grew jealous of the new family. He ordered them extra shifts and forced them to leave their child during work. Eventually The Empire sent a group of soldiers and officers to the colony. The Empire had taken over the company that managed the colony under the false pretense of safety regulations. The real reason the Empire seized the company was for the large amounts of doonium in the mines."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Corbin lied to one of the officers and claimed that Ryland and Fiona were secretly rebel spies, even though they were not at the time. One of the officers named Duggan executed Fiona after forcing them to confess to being rebel spies.

Prior to the destruction of Alderaan, while stationed at the Rebel base on Yavin 4, Ryland recorded the life of himself and Fiona for his younger daughter to read when she grew up. Eighteen hours later, he reported to the transport Echo Delta One, that it had cleared the atmosphere and was ready to make the jump to hyperspace. Ryland's daughter Laina was a passenger aboard that ship, and Ryland hoped it would ferry her to safety on Alderaan to live with her Aunt Rhee and Aunt Eron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
