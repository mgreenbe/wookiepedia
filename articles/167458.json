Z9 was owned by Republic Navy Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin. In the year 20 BBY, the Republic strategy conference, a meeting of several Republic Military officers and the Jedi High Council to discuss the ongoing war effort, was to be held aboard the space station Valor in the Carida system. Z9 and Tarkin were both present on the station shortly before the start of the conference, as they awaited the arrival of one final cruiser. Unbeknownst to Z9 and the others on Valor, the last cruiser had been overtaken by the Separatists, who had loaded the ship with rhydonium, a volatile fuel, and planned to ram the cruiser into the station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the last cruiser emerged from hyperspace, those present on Valor noticed that the ship was coming in fast and showed no signs of stopping. Z9 attempted to hail the cruiser's crew, to no avail. As the ship continued its approach, the rhydonium on board suddenly detonated before the cruiser could reach the station. This premature explosion was triggered by the Republic's D-Squad, a group of spy droids that had boarded the vessel prior to its arrival in the Carida system. While Valor and the Republic fleet over the planet Carida were bombarded with debris, the station itself\u2014which Z9 was still aboard\u2014and many of the Republic vessels remained intact."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The R5 unit Z9's plating was colored light gray and red.
