These nine massive ships scattered across the planet and landed in separate locations, releasing those held within to settle the planet. The Tho Yor themselves would serve as the very foundations for these travelers' new homes and places of study."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the Tho Yor lingered in the Silent Desert where the first members of the Je'daii Order founded the Temple of Force Skills at Qigong Kesh. Beneath the still landscape, caverns stretched outward, shielded from the bizarre muting properties of the sands. The temple's students would focus on enhancing their mental endurance and strength in the relative silence of the desert, focusing on the Force and learning to shield themselves within it. The Je'daii Temple Master, the Je'daii who served as steward of the facility and oversaw its functions, would see that all students maintained proper balance at the temple and kept to their studies. In 25,793 BBY Master Miarta Sek, a Sith, was the Temple's overseer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
