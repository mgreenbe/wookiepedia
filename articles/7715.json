While Anya played with her siblings, her brother was kidnapped by the slaver Sampa Grott. Both of Anya's two sisters went out to search for their brother, and both were also taken by Grott. While mourning the loss of her siblings, Anya relayed the story to a robed man, who fashioned her a dagger from wood and suggested that she go after them. Anya sneaked into Grott's home, and waited until the slaver fell asleep. She threatened Grott with the wooden dagger, and Grott, who was unable to see Anya in the darkness, believed her claim that she was an assassin who had been sent to kill him. Anya forced Grott to free her siblings and leave Batuu in exchange for his life, and returned home to find that Grott had followed her orders, letting her siblings free."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
