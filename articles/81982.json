Such fighting forms were required to compensate for or take advantage of the unique attributes of lightsabers, notably the odd balance of the weapon, all of the weight being in the hilt, and the omni-directional cutting edge. The most prominent lightsaber-oriented combat styles were the seven forms of the Jedi Order, though other organizations were known to have developed their own styles and methods, an example being the Sith-developed Dun M\u00f6ch technique."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The various combat forms owed their unique focuses and methods to the eras in which they were created, as they were oftentimes developed to answer a new generation of weapons technology. For example, the dueling-centric Makashi form was created during a time when Dark Jedi and rogue Force-sensitives ran rampant through the galaxy, and lightsaber duels became a common occurrence, whereas Soresu was developed when such confrontations were rare, and Jedi were more likely to confront blaster-wielding opponents and gunslingers rather than lightsaber duelists."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Overview"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout the millennia since the lightsaber's creation, the art of dueling with them developed into seven \"classic\" forms and numerous other styles. It was difficult to master for a number of reasons, one of them being that all of the weight a lightsaber had was in its hilt. It had been said that only a Force-sensitive individual could completely master lightsaber combat, though there have been some great non-force sensitive duelists, such as Pre Vizsla, or General Grievous. All seven traditional lightsaber forms included the same basic techniques as ancient sword-fighting styles, such as defensive postures, overhand strikes, parries, and counters. A riposte was a technique where the user struck an opponent after deflecting or blocking an attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The lightsaber was a very versatile weapon, owing to its unique lightness and omni-directional cutting ability. It could be wielded one-handed or with both hands. The Jedi were trained to use the Force as a conduit between the wielder and the weapon. Through this bond in the Force, the blade became an extension of their being; it moved with instinct as though it were a part of the body. The Jedi's attunement to the Force accounted for the almost superhuman agility and reflex illustrated in the use of the lightsaber. Early in the weapon's history, when the Sith were numerous, the art of lightsaber dueling flourished. In later periods though, only rarely would Jedi face an adversary with a weapon capable of repelling a lightsaber."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the blade was weightless, two-handed slashes were the most common movement. This was because momentum was still needed to cut through solid objects, as solid objects were repelled by the blade arc until they were changed to gas or plasma. Therefore, momentum was required to counteract the initial repelling force. The stronger the swing, the faster and easier the blade would cut. If little force was applied to the swing, the repelling force of the blade arc would leave shallow cuts. When two lightsaber blades came in contact with each other, the two repelling forces made the blade appear to be solid. Also, the field that caused the energy to arc back into the hilt caused some gyroscopic effects. While technically weightless, the blade still had some resistance to changes in motion. The slight gyroscopic effects were easily controlled by a trained Force user, but could become problematic for the untrained."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early developments"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When lightsaber technology was developed to the point where they became a viable weapon, becoming the standard weapon of the Jedi Order by 7000 BBY, a combat form that accounted for the abilities and weaknesses of the weapon was required. Form I, Shii-Cho, was a highly simplified style, based on age-old fencing principles, and defining the types of attacks, parries, body zones and practice drills that could be utilized with the lightsaber. When Darksiders and fallen Jedi began to arise, lightsaber duels became an almost routine activity, and Shii-Cho was simply not up for the task, as it didn't address lightsaber-to-lightsaber combat. This necessitated the development of Form II, Makashi, a precise and efficient fighting form geared towards lightsaber dueling. This style's prevalence during this era produced many of the greatest dueling masters the galaxy had ever seen, a notable example being Tulak Hord, one of the early Sith Lords."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Makashi was eventually rendered partially obsolete due to the increased distribution and common usage of blasters and other ranged energy weapons. Due to this, the third form, Soresu, was created. An extrapolation and development of Shii-Cho blast-deflect training, Soresu emphasized defensive coverage, characterized by tight and efficient movements. A true Form III master was considered invincible by many. However, the style was not without its detractors, who criticized its focus on defense at the expense of offense. As an answer to the weaknesses of Soresu, Ataru (form IV) and Shien (form V) were developed side by side. Both were highly aggressive combat forms, the former focusing on speed and agility, the latter on strength and attack moves. Notably, Shien exploited the lightsaber's ability to deflect blaster bolts by deliberately deflecting shots towards opponents. Later, a new, more advanced Form V variant known as Djem So was developed, focused on aggressive lightsaber dueling."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While forms IV and V proved highly effective, many more conservative Jedi were put off by their aggressive focuses, and set to work creating a form that balanced all the other focuses with overall moderation, in better keeping with Jedi philosophy. The result was the sixth form, Niman. Developed from the Jar'Kai dual-blade combat style, Niman was a gateway to fantastic lightsaber skill without a focus on power or aggression and became known as the \"diplomat's form\", though it would ironically become the favored style of the fallen Jedi-turned-Sith Lord Exar Kun, a masterful lightsaber duelist. Due to his obvious skill, Kun came to consider himself the greatest duelist in the galaxy, though he ultimately met his match in the Djem So specialist Ulic Qel-Droma. Kun would go on to defeat Vodo-Siosk Baas, the Jedi Battlemaster of the day, and wield one of the earliest saberstaffs, creating the weapon from schematics provided by a Sith holocron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time of the First Jedi Purge, Juyo (form VII) had been created. An advanced and extremely aggressive form, Juyo required high-level mastery of multiple forms to be studied, as it cut perilously close to Sith intensity of focus on combat ability. Specifically, Juyo drew on the agile footwork of Makashi, the tight, aggressive motions of Shien, and the fluid style of Niman. Masters of the form were loath to teach it to those with proven recklessness, and the rarity of practitioners left it in a state of only partial development for almost a thousand years after the Army of Light disbanded with the Ruusan Reforms. Four of the only known practitioners alive following the First Jedi Purge were Jedi Masters Vrook Lamar, Zez-Kai Ell, Kavar and Atris."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Practice and Training during the Sith Resurgence"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the advent of the Great Galactic War, and the re-emergence of the old Sith Empire, the Jedi were once again in widespread confrontation with their bitter enemy. During the interim, the Sith Lords retained full access to the traditional forms, and they were in use within the Empire as early as the Jedi Civil War, with such notables as the Emperor's Wrath Scourge studying Forms VII, IV, and III. There is little doubt the Sith also used the time to develop their own combat styles, although there are few records indicating clearly what they were. This was matched by the Jedi with their development of Juyo-Kos, a refinement of the already lethal Juyo to meet the demands of these dangerous times, which saw frequent and brutal engagements between Jedi and Sith. This point of view is supported by comments from Jerbhen Hulis during his brief duel with Teneb Kel. Notable duelists during this period include Jaric Kaedan, a master of the aforementioned Form VII variant, and Orgus Din, who attained his advanced skill-level through endless practice in an attempt to compensate for his weak aptitude with the Force. On the Sith side were Vindican and Malgus, who were notably the first Sith Lords to cross blades with Jedi in over three hundred years, their opponents being Kao Cen Darach and future Jedi Grand Master, Satele Shan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the New Sith Wars, a Twi'lek duelist known as Kas'im rose to prominence among the Sith, becoming the lightsaber instructor at the Korriban Academy for the Brotherhood of Darkness. Many of his students would go on to be excellent duelists in their own right, a notable example being Darth Bane. In fact, when Bane and Kas'im engaged one another after Bane's rebellion against the Brotherhood, Kas'im demonstrated an aptitude for Jar'Kai dual-blade combat, providing him with an edge over Bane due to the latter's lack of training against such armament. Bane regarded Kas'im as the finest duelist of the era, possibly the greatest to ever exist thus far, and he only prevailed thanks to his superior grasp of the Force. Bane later killed Kas'im's Jedi counterpart, Raskta Lsu."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Post-Ruusan developments"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Final battle of Ruusan, most of the Sith and other Darksider organizations were annihilated or driven into hiding, and Jedi lightsaber combat experienced radical changes as a consequence. The dueling-centric Makashi style was rendered obsolete due to its lack of effectiveness against blaster-wielding opponents, as well as the simple lack of lightsaber-wielding opponents. The more obscure weapon variants likewise suffered; by 32 BBY, the use of double-bladed lightsabers in actual combat as opposed to training was practically unheard of. Despite this, the era produced one of the greatest lightsaber duelists to ever exist: Yoda. The eventual Grand Master of the Jedi Order mastered all seven forms over the course of his nine-hundred year lifespan, but specialized in Ataru, as the style's broad swordplay and heavy use of acrobatics compensated for his lack of height and reach. His fighting form was a masterful demonstration of many of the standard components of Ataru, and was a wonder to behold."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Other great duelists to arise during this period include Dooku, who stubbornly specialized in Makashi, despite the style's apparent obsolescence, considering it among the highest of fighting forms; Siolo Ur Manka, who ranked among the greatest Jedi warriors before renouncing the lightsaber and focusing on staff-fighting, which he felt was a \"purer\" technique; and Mace Windu. Windu was a Juyo specialist who was working towards completing the form, as the lack of duelists with the self-control necessary to practice Form VII left it still under development. The result was the Vaapad Style, named for a predator native to the moons of Sarapin. A dangerous style that cut close to the dark side, it required Jedi to allow themselves to enjoy the thrill of battle, channeling their own fury while feeding off the aggression of the enemy, creating a feedback loop of power. Windu developed the style with the aid of fellow Jedi swordmaster Sora Bulq, and only trained his own Padawan, Depa Billaba, in the style. Notably, Bulq taught Quinlan Vos elements of Vaapad during the amnesiac Jedi's retraining, though he said nothing of the style, and Vos refrained from applying it after learning more of it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among the Sith, Darth Sidious' apprentice Darth Maul proved to be an exceptional duelist. One of the most highly trained Sith in the history of the order, Maul was instructed in several obscure combat forms, notably considering himself a master of a corrupt Sith version of Juyo. In addition to his highly developed skills as a martial combatant, Maul also wielded a double-bladed lightsaber. Creating the weapon after a failed engagement against Siolo'urmanka drew him to the conclusion that simple one-bladed lightsabers were too limiting, Maul went on to defeat the Jedi with his more unorthodox armament. The Jedi's inexperience with the weapon and his own skill with it provided Maul with an edge over many of his opponents, and great Jedi swordmasters such as Anoon Bondara and Qui-Gon Jinn fell before his blades. Maul was only defeated by Jinn's Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, when he dropped his guard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Maul thought dead, Sidious was forced to find a replacement, recruiting Dooku after he left the Jedi Order, dubbing him Darth Tyranus, while Obi-Wan Kenobi would go on to train Anakin Skywalker, the rising star of the Jedi Order. Skywalker specialized in Form V, as the aggressive fighting form was a good match to his bold, confrontational personality type. However, Skywalker's rapid advancement only fed his ego, and he came to consider himself a match for Yoda himself. He was given a sobering reminder of how much he still had to learn when Tyranus cut off his arm, ending their intense bout. Kenobi himself specialized in Soresu, adopting the style after coming to the conclusion that Ataru's lack of defensive capabilities resulted in Qui-Gon Jinn's death. While the defensive fighting form stood him in good stead against blaster-wielding opponents, his own confrontation with Tyranus went less well, as Dooku's precision bladework simply worked around Kenobi's staunch defense."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Developments during the Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Clone Wars would bring about a multitude of changes in lightsaber combat, as the more moderate forms the Jedi had specialized in for the last millennia proved lacking on the battlefield, calling for specialist combat styles. Notably, all the Niman practitioners involved in the Battle of Geonosis perished in combat. In preparation for the Sith-orchestrated war, Dooku recruited several other duelists into his personal cadre of Dark Acolytes, notables being the fallen Sora Bulq and the Rattataki warlord Asajj Ventress. Ventress' skills with the lightsaber were sufficient to impress Dooku and Sidious, and she was provided with further instruction from the former, notably in Makashi lightsaber combat. Dooku also trained the Kaleesh cyborg Grievous in lightsaber combat, which Grievous was capable of learning because of the enhanced speed and reflexes of his mechanical body. Grievous would become one of the most prolific Jedi hunters of the era, collecting their lightsabers as grisly trophies, and defeating such notables as, Shaak Ti, and Eeth Koth, as well as dueling Mace Windu to a stalemate. Other great duelists who became casualties of the war included Sora Bulq and Depa Billaba, leaving Mace Windu as the last master of Vaapad."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the end of the war, Dooku and Grievous were slain by Skywalker and Kenobi, respectively. Their vastly increased skill marked them as two of the finest duelists in the Jedi Order, with Dooku crediting Skywalker as the finest Djem So stylist that he had ever seen, and Mace Windu recognizing Kenobi as \"the Master of Soresu\". Windu's Vaapad style also faced its own ultimate test during his confrontation with Darth Sidious, revealed to be the Republic Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Palpatine's advanced combat skills and Dark side powers allowed him to strike down Agen Kolar and Saesee Tiin instantly. Kit Fisto and Windu were left alone to battle the vicious Sith Lord. Fisto's swordsmanship barely enabled him to hold Sidious off before he, too, fell. Three of the best swordsmen on the Jedi Council were now dead, forcing Windu to fully channel his Vaapad. The feedback loop of power formed by Windu's Vaapad left both combatants in a contest of indefinite length, until Windu managed to seize the tactical advantage, disarming Palpatine and seemingly defeating the Dark Lord of the Sith. However, Windu's apparent victory wouldn't last long, as Anakin Skywalker intervened, defecting to the Sith and cutting off Windu's sword hand, leaving him vulnerable to Palpatine's Sith powers. Mace Windu, one of the greatest duelists in the Jedi Order, considered second only to Yoda, was dead."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker, now Darth Vader, would spearhead the sack of the Jedi Temple, personally felling many of the Jedi within, including the children. Even the Jedi swordmaster and Council member Cin Drallig was unable to hold out long against Vader's brutal intensity. Vader would only find his match in his former master; Kenobi's mastery of defensive Soresu proved to be the perfect foil to Vader's all out offense. In one of the greatest lightsaber duels of all time, Kenobi would give ground before Darth Vader's relentless attack, guiding the battle to a location of his choice and seizing the tactical advantage. Overestimating his abilities, Vader attempted to vault over Kenobi but was dismembered by his former master and left to die on the shore of a Mustafar lava river. He only survived when Palpatine, fresh from his own contest with Yoda, rescued him. Realizing that the new Sith Order could not be brought down through martial might, Kenobi and Yoda went into hiding traveling to Tatooine and Dagobah respectively."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Developments during the Great Jedi Purge"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Jedi Order essentially destroyed, lightsaber combat development slowed to a crawl, and most efforts were spearheaded by the Sith. However, the combat forms themselves would still be preserved in surviving records and holocrons, as well as among the Sith. Nonetheless, this time period saw the rise of Darth Vader. Now encumbered by his heavy life-support armor, Vader was forced to customize and adjust his lightsaber technique to compensate. His resulting combat form included elements from numerous techniques of combat, relying on brute force and precision to counter the more acrobatic fighting forms the Jedi survivors favored. With this unique, though somewhat archaic fighting method, Vader became the most prolific Jedi hunter ever. Vader's skills as a duelist would also carry over to several of his apprentices, such as Starkiller and Kharys. Starkiller practiced Juyo and Soresu, while favoring a Shien-style reversed-grip, and bested skilled duelists as Kazdan Paratus, Rahm Kota, and even Darth Vader when he reached his prime as a lightsaber duelist. He was able to compete with Shaak Ti not far off from his prime, but had to use the Force to best her. Kharys created the Trispzest fighting style, a combination of traditional S'kytri aerial dueling and Form VII lightsaber combat. Starkiller ultimately rebelled against his master, and eventually managed to defeat Vader before perishing in a confrontation with Palpatine. This era also saw the emergence of the Emperor's Shadow Guard and the Imperial Saber Guard. The Shadow Guardsman favored Lightsaber pikes, and typically operated as Palpatine's enforcers, while the Saber Guardsman were provided with standard lightsabers and were provided with the prerequisite tutoring, and strongly favored Shien-style reversed grips. Both groups were highly effective on the battle field, though considerably less so against trained Jedi duelists, such as Starkiller or his clone."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Arguably the greatest lightsaber duelist of his age, Luke Skywalker was an absolute natural with the weapon.

Within months, he was skilled enough to overcome Vader's former student Kharys, a practitioner of Form VII lightsaber combat and creator of the Trispzest style. His capabilities were further developed during his training under Yoda, and Skywalker's resulting combat style was an instinctual mimicry of Vader's personalized variation on Form V, with elements of Ataru and Soresu included.

Lumiya wielded a unique lightwhip against Luke, with lashes of both energy and metals. As Lumiya noted, Luke's Jedi training only prepared him for a weapon that was either energy or solid, not one that was both. Luke would quickly adapt, constructing a shoto lightsaber and wielding it as a secondary weapon, allowing him to engage the whip's energy tendrils with one blade while shredding the solid ones with the other. Skywalker would eventually develop to the point where he could compete with the resurrected Palpatine himself in duels, slicing off the Sith Lord's hand. When Luke set about reestablishing the Jedi Order, he was aided in combat techniques by Kam Solusar, who was trained in lightsaber combat by Palpatine's Dark Side Elite, and Corran Horn, a former member of Corellian Security Force who had training in various unarmed combat techniques.

The three forms of the Jedi Order were eventually created, each specializing in a different aspect of combat. The Strong style focused on brute strength and offense, often at the expense of defense. The Fast style focused on speed and precision, and was especially good for blast-deflection. The Medium style balanced out between the previous two, and oftentimes acted as a tutorial form, much like Shii-Cho for the old Jedi Order.

However, Form I was not as useful against single opponents, as such enemies had complete mobility and could find a weakness in Shii-Cho's comparatively clumsy bladework.

In fact, lightwhip blades were even known to short out violently when struck with enough force."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Unarmed combat"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the various forms of lightsaber combat were all fully developed martial art forms, they were not limited to use with the lightsaber, and unarmed combat training was standard among many Force-based organizations. Most species were known to engage in this kind of combat, and a number of sentient species and cultures also developed it into different martial arts proper; just as the various lightsaber combat forms could be applied unarmed, so too could many of these unarmed combat styles be applied with the lightsaber. Darth Maul and Anoon Bondara were both students of the Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si martial art, developed by the Followers of Palawa, who became accomplished lightsaber duelists. The Echani martial art was an unarmed combat discipline known to be taught to military special forces throughout the galaxy, and may have been taught to Meetra Surik."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During duels, such physical attacks were applied with astonishing regularity, oftentimes with the goal of disorienting an opponent prior to a finishing attack. As disarming was a common goal in lightsaber duels, it was not unheard of for both opponents to lose their weapons, causing the fight to degenerate into a brawl. In fact, fighters have been known to draw on the Force to augment their speed and strength, allowing them to unleash powerful hits that threw opponents across the room, or literally tear them limb from limb."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lightsabers, and by extension lightsaber combat, were inspired by the pirate and romantic films of the 1940s, which heavily featured rapier fencing and the like. In keeping with these romanticized depictions of fighting, the lightsabers were intended to represent the honor and chivalry inherent in the Jedi. Jedi were initially conceived as fighting with swords, but George Lucas wanted to provide them with a technological edge, and created the lightsaber. His rationale was that in an era of energy weapons, lightsabers could be used to deflect the rays, giving birth to the idea of blast-deflection. Lucas wanted the earliest lightsaber duels to feature a very oriental style of fencing, reminiscent of Japanese fighting styles, which involved a great deal of honor and spirituality."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The original lightsaber duel in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope was choreographed by Peter Diamond. According to Diamond, George Lucas wanted a broadsword-dueling style of fighting, with a touch of Japanese Kendo included. All of the fighting moves in the duel were two-handed strokes, in keeping with Lucas' initial concept that lightsabers were incredibly heavy and difficult to handle. Also, due to the brittleness of the stunt blades used during this fight, which were little more than wooden dowels, Diamond was forced to instruct Alec Guinness and David Prowse to stop their blades before contact due to their fragility."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Star Wars saga carried on, Lucas rethought the fighting styles. He decided to make them \"faster and more intense,\" symbolizing Luke Skywalker's increasing mastery of the weapon. One-handed fighting methods resembling European rapier fencing came to be included. The choreography of the duels in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi was also used to show Luke Skywalker's development as a character. In The Empire Strikes Back, Mark Hamill was choreographed to show Luke Skywalker fighting as hard as he was able against the bitter enemy of Darth Vader, though the duel in Return of the Jedi was more centered on the emotional context of the fight. Also, due to David Prowse's tendency to break the prop lightsaber blades during the filming of A New Hope, all of Darth Vader's fight scenes had Bob Anderson acting as Prowse's fighting double."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the prequel trilogy began filming, Peter Diamond was replaced by Nick Gillard, who completely rethought the Jedi fighting styles. George Lucas envisioned that during this time period, the Jedi had reached their peak in terms of martial arts development, so the choreography had to be a great deal faster and more sophisticated. Gillard wanted to convey the sense that the Jedi had studied every single style of swordplay available, his idea being that since they had chosen such a short-range weapon, they would have to be so good if they're up against ray guns and lasers. Gillard choreographed the duels as what he described as \"a chessgame played at a thousand miles an hour,\" with every move being analogous to a check. Aiding Gillard was the martial artist Ray Park, who portrayed Darth Maul, and helped train Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to his age and consequent lack of mobility, Christopher Lee was replaced by stunt double Kyle Rowling for Count Dooku's more complex dueling shots. However, Lee was able to perform some of the moves, particularly during the close-up shots. Attack of the Clones was also the first Star Wars film to feature a large number of Jedi in a battlefield situation. To create this, numerous martial artists were hired and filmed either individually or in small groups in front of a blue screen. All the footage was then compiled and edited into vignettes that were composited into either footage of the Arena model, or a computer-generated background. Similarly to Christopher Lee, Ian McDiarmid was also replaced by his stunt double due to his age, though he also performed certain moves on the close-up shots."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The seven forms of lightsaber combat received their first description and elaboration in the Fightsaber: Jedi Lightsaber Combat article released in Star Wars Insider 62. While these fighting styles would be mentioned and used in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast and its sequel, Jedi Academy would instead use the three styles; Fast, Medium, and Strong. While each of these forms had strong parallels to the Three Rings of Defense described in the 1998 Expanded Universe novel I, Jedi, they may be little more than game mechanics."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
