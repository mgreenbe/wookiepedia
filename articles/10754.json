Mounted on turrets, they used carbonite freeze rays to put out fires, or, if their programming was altered as happened at the Peragus Mining Facility, to freeze living beings where they stood. In the case of Peragus, HK-50 was responsible for the alteration of their programming to prevent the miners from capturing the Jedi Exile."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
