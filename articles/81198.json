These lizards and the plants needed grew mainly on the planets Zebitrope IV and Zebitrope VIII, but could be exported elsewhere. The purplish mold was generally scraped off with a spatula, then rubbed into the hollow at the base of the user's throat. This left a distinctive purple stain that most addicts took to covering up with flesh-colored powder."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lesai allowed Humans, and perhaps other sentient species, to go without the need for sleep.
