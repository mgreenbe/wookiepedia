Although the entire world was inhospitable, the area in the region of the Southern Pole was particularly hazardous. It had fifteen-meter waves of caustic sand that continually rose and cascaded down again, intermittent lava geysers randomly peppering the landscape, and skies filled with a permanent ion storm. Because of the many dangers it posed, the Sea of Sand was completely devoid of population."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Late in the Clone Wars, the Separatist cruiser Obrexta III, damaged after an attack by Galactic Republic forces, made a blind jump through hyperspace and crash-landed on Ponemah in the Sea of Sand with its cargo: the clone trooper Kix, who had been frozen in stasis on his way to interrogation by Count Dooku. Five decades, an ion storm caused the Obrexta III's distress beacon to reactivate, leading several bands of pirates on the planet to brave the desert and its hazards in search of Dooku's treasure, as the deceased Sith Lord had once been the wealthiest man in the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
