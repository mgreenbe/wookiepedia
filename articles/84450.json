The M'usts had a religious culture that worshipped an eternally burning flame beneath their planet's surface, and generally followed a simple, peaceful way of life. After the Imperial conquest of their world, the M'usts came across Rebel warrior Cody Sunn-Childe, who shocked the natives by becoming the first to survive immersion in their holy flame. The M'usts thus took Sunn-Childe to be their god, and worshipped and supported the Jashwik as he learned their peaceful philosophy and how to command his newly awakened psychic abilities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "M'usts first appeared in Star Wars 46, written by John Marc DeMatteis and released in 1981.
