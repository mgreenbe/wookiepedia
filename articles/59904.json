After its discovery on Nim Drovis by Jarn Harvus, the harvorisk was hunted by Hutts, who considered it alternately an exotic new pet and a tasty meal. But, due to its rapid rate of breeding and vicious behavior, the Hutts decided to get free of them, releasing them into the wild. It was presumed that these beasts could survive the planet's toxic atmosphere thanks to a genetic modification that could allow them to survive the pollution at the cost of half their lifespan. The Three Families introduced harvorisks to Quesh, genetically modifying them to survive in the atmosphere but at the cost of half of their lifespan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
