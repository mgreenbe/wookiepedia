He frequently fell behind the rest of his team, led by FN-2187, during their training simulations, leading to his nickname of \"Slip.\" FN-2187 often had to rescue Slip in those simulations, including in one where the team assaulted a New Republic bunker with the objective of destroying a heavy repeating blaster. Slip was reprimanded by Captain Phasma after the simulation ended, and Phasma further ordered FN-2187 to stop rescuing Slip. As Phasma explained, Slip was the weakest link and helping him would weaken the First Order.
