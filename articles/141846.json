Termadus was a much younger star than its counterpart. A gaseous haze arose between the two due to Termadus drawing gases from Morasil's corona. Termadus, Morasil, and their haze gave off a combined light equivalent to a single bright star. Together, the two stars also created a much bigger hyperspace shadow than their individual profiles would call for."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
