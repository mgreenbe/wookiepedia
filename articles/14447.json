A month after General Garm Bel Iblis forces' raid on Tangrene, Bel Iblis met the Alliance member Borsk Fey'lya. The Bothan agreed to support Garm Bel Iblis's movement and set up a supply line through New Cov. The battle began when four Bothan starships under the command of Fey'lya found an Imperial Victory-class Star Destroyer investigating New Cov in the Churba sector. The Bothan ships kept the Star Destroyer busy until a Star Cruiser arrived to reinforce them. The battle allowed Fey'lya and Bel Iblis to keep their alliance secret for years. In 9 ABY, Han and Leia Organa Solo spoke of the battle while discussing Borsk Fey'lya's war activities."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle was first mentioned in the 1992 novel Dark Force Rising, which was written by Timothy Zahn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
