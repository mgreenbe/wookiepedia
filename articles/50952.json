It was intended to transport members of the Shaper caste and the Order of Yun-Yuuzhan to Borleias, with the intent of turning the world into haven for the Priests of Yun-Yuuzhan. However, Warmaster Tsavong Lah actually intended it to be the place of death for Priest Takhaff Uul and Master Shaper Ghithra Dal, who had sabotaged the Warmaster's radank claw-arm, and those who had aided them. Lah fed the thirty conspirators to four rancors that had been hidden aboard the Fu'ulanh, but would inform the Shaper and Priest castes that the vessel was destroyed by New Republic fighters upon reaching Borleias. The Fu'ulanh was presumably destroyed sometime after that."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
