Korin specialized in researching the ancient Ordu Aspectu, a nearly-forgotten splinter group of the Jedi Order that disappeared with little trace millennia before Chelli's birth during the Republic Era. After the Great Jedi Purge, Korin began neglecting his family to focus on his work, believing it would make the galaxy safer for his daughter by restoring the light that had died with the Jedi. The Jedi were a group of spiritual followers of the the Force who had served as the primary peacekeepers of the Republic for thousands of generations. While the Jedi were dedicated to the light, they had counterparts in the dark side of the Force called the Sith. The existence of the Sith was doubted by the time Chelli was born, but the Sith Lord Darth Sidious was secretly responsible for the galactic strife. The Sith's long-last artifacts were said to be deadly and destructive, but Chelli found her father's stories of them much more interesting than those of the Jedi. It seemed to Chelli that Korin only paid attention to her when she pretended to be interested in his Jedi research."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lona struggled in her marriage due to her husband's obsession with locating the Ancient Aspects of the Jedi and what she saw as his need to achieve greatness. Although she never outright hated him, they disagreed on what was best for Chelli. Lona would not compromise on that, and thought her family should both live without fear of consequences and make a new home in the middle of nowhere.

Chelli's father asked her if she would like to stay home and play with her pet tooka or join him on an adventure. Wanting her father's attention and the thrill of possible danger, she agreed. It turned out he invited her in part because she was small enough to slip into narrow spaces to locate hidden materials, cute enough to distract the librarians while her father gathered up the materials, and able to help carry them after he bribed a librarian.

Preoccupied with his discovery, he did not notice Chelli cut her finger on one of the crystals. Lona did not share his excitement, as his research could get the family marked by censors for a firing squad, and Chelli did not understand why her father did not seem to care about her injury.

Lona said it was called the dark side because they kept in the dark to be secretive and more easily impose order in their belief that it was the right thing. Idealists like Korin and the Jedi had a simplistic perspective of good and evil that involved purists shouting at each other while labeling the other side heretics; such idealism was useless in the shifting galaxy and just made people fight. Idealists just brought trouble down on themselves and others.  She told Chelli, \"Evil's just a measure of how much your choices take away other's peoples,\" and that all anyone could hope for was to do right by the people they loved.

She had neglected to tell either of them about the other and they confronted her together, which caused her to be late for Toob-Nix's class again. After successfully sneaking into Toob-Nix's classroom through a window, she gave herself away by interrupting him as he told her fellow cadets that all of the artifacts once stored at the universary library on the Fifth Moon of Thrinittik had been destroyed, along with the entire structure, in a cataclysmic blast; the Empire had destroyed the library sometime after Aphra's childhood visit there with her father. She protested that while the library had been attacked and much of it had decayed, enough of the structure remained that some of the artifacts may remain buried and preserved, awaiting an expedition to uncover them. The Sava dismissed her ideas as a fairy tale that would never be authorized. As they argued about her belief that unsanctioned expeditions and taking dangerous risks were worth it and what archaeology was about, another student named Sana Starros spoke up and agreed with her. Starros further pointed out that there was research in their university library that supported Aphra's assertions.

Toob-Nix angrily expelled Aphra from his classroom. Aphra later told the day's events to her friend Susina, who urged Aphra not to antagonize the Sava.

Instead of replying with another insult, Toob-Nix lead her to a secret room in the university where he stored several abersyn symbiotes which he had collected over decades, and made quiescent by exposure to plasma venting. Horrified that the Sava was concealing the highly illegal mind-controlling parasites, Aphra listened as Toob-Nix revealed to Aphra the true reason he had chosen her for his personal supervision: not because he saw Aphra as a poor student who cared more about excitement than archaeology, but simply because he hated her.

The doctor crawled prone to the safe and disconnected the personality matrix and stowed it on her body without incident. However, on her return journey crawling under the lasers, she fluked and triggered them. Aphra was forced to sprint to the hangar of the quarantine world as the facility self-destructed around her. After outrunning a shielded droideka and diving under a closing doorway, Aphra was confronted by Quarantine World III's curator and her old adversary, Utani Xane. Aphra was unsurprised to see the Kallidahin working at the facility, and handed over her blaster pistol and the personality matrix to Xane's handful of B2-series super battle droids without argument\u2014 though, as Aphra was placed in stuncuffs, she did insist that the Triple-Zero matrix should be in an armory, not left stagnant in quarantine or a museum for centuries. Before Aphra could be escorted away back to prison, an uninvited TIE line starfighter approached and released none other than Darth Vader. Mouth agape at the arrival of Vader himself, Aphra watched as the dark lord systematically eradicated the B2 battle droids using the Force and his red-bladed lightsaber. Aphra took advantage of the chaos and tackled Xane, who was attempting to flee with the personality matrix.

Aphra picked herself up and came to the conclusion that Vader was more worthy than the Droid Gotra, so she turned ownership of BT-1 and Triple-Zero over to him and explained that he could find troops of unquestioning loyalty on Geonosis in the form of the portable droid factory that she was hired to obtain for the Droid Gotra as well.

Vader, pleased that she had thus far been entirely loyal and resourceful, stated that he would not end her life until he saw fit.

A patriot, Tahn stood firm, insisting that he would never betray Amidala\u2014not even her memory. Tahn argued that Amidala had been a good queen, which was why he would not betray her. Annoyed with Tahn's unwillingness to comply, retorted that a strong queen would have beaten out Amidala's good queen act in the end.
