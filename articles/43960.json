In 3643 BBY, the Emperor's Glory attacked the Wanderer-class transport Esseles so that Kilran could capture the Republic ambassador Vyn Asara and from this vessel he sent Imperials and Mandalorians onto Esseles. In the battle, it was boarded by individuals from the Esseles, and its tractor beam shut down, allowing Esseles to escape. After failing to capture Ambassador Asara, it later led the Fifth Fleet in ambushing the First Expeditionary Fleet in the Maelstrom nebula, but the Telos under the command of Admiral Oteg was able to destroy the Glory with the combined firepower of his fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
