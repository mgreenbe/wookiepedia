Born on the planet Coruscant to wealthy Coruscanti parents, Dystra grew up in the environment of palatial estates and private schools. She was placed in a Galactic Empire readjustment camp run by the Imperial Commission for the Preservation of the New Order at age thirteen. Her parents had been arrested, never to be seen again, as Alliance to Restore the Republic sympathizers in the aftermath of the dissolution of the Imperial Senate. Dystra was rescued from the readjustment camp by Rebel Alliance Special Operations and placed in a foster home. Wanting to honor her parents' sacrifice, Dystra entered law enforcement for the new galactic government, the New Republic, becoming an agent with the New Republic Security Force. She quickly rose to become an effective police officer with a high arrest record. However, in her eagerness, Dystra took frequent, unnecessary risks, and she was twice wounded in action."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Human female, Myleena Dystra was born on the Core World planet Coruscant in 13 BBY, during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Dystra's mother and father were affluent Coruscanti, and Dystra grew up in a palatial estate on Coruscant and attended private schools. When Emperor Palpatine disbanded the Imperial Senate in 0 BBY, the Senate Building was taken over by Imperial stormtroopers, who detained hundreds of individuals for questioning and to issue arrest warrants. Dystra's parents were two of those detained. They were never released, and Dystra did not see them again. She later discovered they had an affiliation with the Alliance to Restore the Republic, also known as the Rebel Alliance, which sought to overthrow the Empire. Now effectively an orphan, Dystra was taken under the wing of the Empire's political bureaucracy, the Commission for the Preservation of the New Order (COMPNOR), and sent to a readjustment camp to be indoctrinated on Imperial philosophy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after Dystra entered the COMPNOR camp, a Rebel Alliance Special Operations team rescued her, and she was taken to a Rebel safeworld. There, she was placed in a Rebel Alliance foster home and was brought up to appreciate her parents' sacrifice. As she grew older, Dystra became determined to join the cause of her parents. After the Rebel Alliance formed the New Republic, which replaced the Empire as the dominate galactic government, Dystra became an agent with the New Republic Security Force (NRSF). She quickly established herself as a highly effective police officer with an impressive record of arrests. She also was involved in several major engagements and was wounded in two separate incidents. She narrowly escaped death during the second time she was wounded in action."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Myleena Dystra was a young and enthusiastic woman determined to do justice for the cause in which she and her parents believed.
