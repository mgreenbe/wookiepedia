The mist generator was simple in design, expelling the contents of a high pressure cartridge when pressure was applied to a handle at the end of the device. The cartridge, which required replacement after each use, normally generated a fire-extinguishing mist that settled into a foam capable of smothering flames. They could also be used to create a smog thick enough to conceal the user, which could be used to cover an escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The technology supply company Galladinium Galactic Exports sold the generators through their product datalog between the Battle of Yavin and the Battle of Hoth during the Galactic Civil War fought by the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic.
