The main drawback of the technology was that it could only detect the heightened brain wave activity within twenty meters. This technology's real ability to detect Force-sensitives remained unknown to the only known buyer of the chip: I-5YQ. Den Dhur frustrated with the aforementioned drawbacks of the device smashed it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
