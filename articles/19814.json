When siblings of the Faithful came of age, their parents presented them with either the Bowl or the Feather, indicating their path in life and the Life To Come. Those given the Bowl lived their lives as ascetics of the faith so that their sibling would be enriched. In the Life To Come, however, those given the Bowl would be richly rewarded and served by the sibling who had been enriched in life. Ylanda Captison, sister of Bakuran Senator Gaeriel Captison was given the Bowl at the age of fourteen and lived her life as an ascetic. Yeorg Captison, when given the Bowl by his family, did not accept it and left the Faith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
