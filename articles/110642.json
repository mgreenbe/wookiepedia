Sear entered the temple's air ducts and released mini-drone explosives throughout the facility, putting the Jedi inhabitants into a state of emergency. While setting explosives on the central spire on the roof of the temple, Sear was confronted by Caleb Dume, a Jedi youngling, and Jedi Master Depa Billaba. Sear managed to fight off the two Jedi, but was unable to complete his mission as Billaba destroyed his explosives. Realizing he was outnumbered, Sear released the last of his miniature explosives and leapt from the roof of the temple to his death, rather than be spared by the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like other Kage Warriors, Rackham Sear Sodi wore dark colored clothing, including a hood that covered his face.
