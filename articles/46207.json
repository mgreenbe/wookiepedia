These machines came in a variety of classes from bipedal units to quad legged ones with some ranging from humanoid height to others being much larger.

Upon being released, Revan was determined to stop the Sith Emperor at all costs and traveled to the Infinite Empire facility where he began using the installation to manufacture an endless army with which he intended to exterminate anyone with Sith bloodlines. This act would have led to the elimination of 97.8% of the population of the Sith Empire. Coordination and command of these units was left in the hands of the assassin droid HK-47."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the time, a strike force was dispatched into the Foundry in order to stop Revan where the spacers encountered the extermination droids that were defending the installation.
