He was at Vindi's hidden lab on the planet Naboo. Vindi gave LEP-86C8 the last virus bomb to store in the lab's bomb room, which was witnessed by captured Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala. After Vindi was arrested by Republic forces, the droid hid in the lab. He was pursued by the Republic troops, who were attempting to secure and defuse all of the bombs, and was relieved of the explosive by Padm\u00e9 and Padawan Ahsoka Tano. He eventually escaped and set off Vindi's virus bombs, destroying himself and unleashing the Blue Shadow Virus into the lab, necessitating its quarantine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
