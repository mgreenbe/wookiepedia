Kanos, like all the other guards, held an unwavering loyalty to the ideals of Emperor Palpatine. Managing to evade the destruction of the superweapon Death Star II and the planet Byss, where much of the guard was stationed, Kanos was the final loyal member of the unit after their ultimate massacre at Yinchorr, under the orders of fellow guardsman and aspiring Emperor, Carnor Jax. Kanos swore a \"blood oath\" against the traitor and those who had a hand in Palpatine's ultimate demise. Kanos's actions led him to become the most wanted man in the galaxy; a massive bounty was put on his head by the Imperial Remnant. His efficient skills in combat allowed him to stay alive. Kanos made allies in the New Republic on Phaeda, becoming romantically involved with Republic lieutenant Mirith Sinn. With assistance from his temporary allies in the Republic, Kanos slew the would-be Emperor Jax on Yinchorr in the name of Palpatine. This was at the cost of his alliance with Sinn, who swore her own blood oath against Kanos for the murder of her close friend, Sish Sadeet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kanos then swore to eliminate everyone that had helped accelerate Palpatine's ultimate death, namely the Imperial Ruling Council, who were engulfed in an internal power struggle following the death of their leader, Jax. In order to infiltrate the organization, Kanos partnered with Tav Kennede, whose late father was the head of the Royal Guard Academy, and went undercover as bounty hunter \"Kenix Kil\" with the intention of being hired by the Council to hunt his alter ego, who had a sizable bounty placed on his dead, effectively gaining their trust. However, before Kanos could infiltrate their ranks, an impostor eliminated the Council members one by one, and Kanos unwittingly became entangled in a conspiracy by the criminal organization Black Sun to infiltrate the ranks of the Ruling Council by replacing their members with accelerated clones functioning as political puppets. Kanos opted to temporarily call off his plot in order to save Mirith Sinn, who was captured by Black Sun associate Grappa the Hutt and handed to the Zanibar people. These events culminated in Kanos's assassination of Xandel Carivus, head of the Ruling Council and self-declared Galactic Emperor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kanos continued operating as a bounty hunter, taking up assignments in various backwater sectors and hoping to one day take on Luke Skywalker, the primary figure in Palpatine's death. Eventually, Kanos was sought by the Restored Empire, an Imperial splinter group under the command of Ennix Devian, Palpatine's former personal assassin. Devian wished for Kanos to join his cause in bringing back the glory of the Empire as it was under the days of Emperor Palpatine. To this end, the bounty hunter Boba Fett was hired to bring Kanos to the planetoid RZ7-6113-23, the \"hard-liner\" home base. Kanos saw Devian as a foil to his own sense of honor and devotion; Devian's brutal actions and tactics convinced Kanos to drop his own blood oath against Luke Skywalker and Palpatine's enemies in the pursuit of the greater good. Kanos escaped the planetoid via a captured shuttle and met with Mirith Sinn on Coruscant. However, Kanos was unaware that he was being used by Devian to plant a small but volatile supply of the material zinethium, embedded inside the shuttle, in the galactic capital, with the intent of bringing about the destruction of both the New Republic and the Imperial Remnant. Being framed for the attempted mass murder of millions, Kanos found himself allying with Baron Ragez D'Asta for a final assault on the fleet of the Restored Empire above the Imperial capital Orinda, slaying Devian in combat.

Alongside forty-three other recruits, Kanos arrived on Yinchorr, the home of the Imperial Royal Guard Academy. On this wasteland of a world, Kanos and his fellow soldiers were exposed to the roughest conditions and forced to fight constantly, in a dangerous arena known as the Squall. It was in the Squall that Kanos first came to know the ambitious soldier known as Carnor Jax. Jax and Kanos were often sparring partners within the Squall, with Jax almost always the victor. Both of them were trained early on by Myn Kyneugh. As their training progressed, Kanos and Jax came to be known as two of the most skilled recruits, surely destined for a place in the Guard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Kanos was soon to discover several more trials before his advancement. Although he and Jax were obvious standouts, another soldier, Burr Danid, was more highly praised as the best among the recruits. When Palpatine visited the academy in a special visit, Danid was presented as the foremost student among Kanos's class. Kanos and Jax watched as Danid was used in a demonstration with the Emperor's favorite disciple, Darth Vader. Vader and Danid dueled within the Squall as the other recruits watched, but it was not a fair fight. Danid was easily outmatched by the Sith Lord's ferocity and skill, and he was easily overpowered. Vader showed no mercy as he brutally slew the young man, throwing his wounded body into the depths of the Squall. Kanos was visibly shocked by the merciless demonstration, but understood the lesson being taught. Only the best could be given the honor to defend the Emperor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the training continued, Kanos became among the best in his class. The original class of forty-three was eventually reduced down to only a few. The remaining men were put into pairs so that they would learn to rely on their \"brothers\" for support, aid, and companionship. Kanos was paired with fellow recruit Lemmet Tauk, and they grew to depend on each other during a year long stint in which they trained and lived together. Kanos and Tauk were overjoyed when they were selected as the final four recruits to survive the training.

Without an Emperor, Kanos carried on alone for several years, leaving active duty, but still trying to live up to the Emperor's ideals.

After bribing the dock master, Kanos went to take a drink in the local cantina. While there, he tried eavesdropping on several Imperial officers, eventually instigating a confrontation. Kanos killed the men, and then executed an entire squad of stormtroopers that came to their defense. Kanos quickly departed the scene, eventually being helped by New Republic sympathizer Tem Merkon.

However, the romance was cut short, as the location of the base had been betrayed to the Empire by Tem Merkon, and Kanos's livelihood was once again put in jeopardy. Forced to take to the field, Kanos took part in the ensuing battle, routing the Empire's forces under Colonel Xexus Shev and helping win the day for the fledgling New Republic.

Kanos's skill was with him, and he quickly dispatched the Blackhole troopers, setting the stage for a final duel between the two men. Within the Squall, the arena where Jax had always been the victor, Kanos and Jax engaged in their final duel. Kanos's ferocity quickly gave him the upper hand, but he was merciful to his opponent, letting him regain his footing after initially disarming him.

Back in his Skipray blastboat, Kanos eventually arrived on the planet of Baramorra.

With the plan set in motion, Kanos traveled with Feena's clone, her \"father\", and Mirith Sinn to Orinda, narrowly saving Gilad Pellaeon from capture by Devian's forces inside his base. After the reveal of the Feena clone to Devian and the mobilization of the dormant D'Astan fleet hidden in the Orindan system, a massive firefight erupted, killing General Vota and most of Devian's stormtroopers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kanos pursued Devian to his shuttle, where he announced his intent to destroy the hardliner cause once and for all. After announcing that he was trained personally in combat by Darth Vader, Devian attacked Kanos. Although Kanos managed to sever the warlord's weapon in the ensuing duel, Devian eventually gained the upper hand, bisecting Kanos's weapon and piercing him in the chest with his vibro-blade. Critically injured, Kanos used whatever strength he had left to overpower Devian and skewer him vertically through the left shoulder, putting an end to the hardliner plot."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Post-\"mortem\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Kanos was critically injured by Devian's attack, he survived long enough for Mirith Sinn to transport him to one of Baron D'Asta's hidden safehouses in the D'Astan system. Believing Kanos to be dying, Sinn said her goodbyes and returned to the galactic capital, speaking before the Chief of State, Leia Organa, to posthumously pardon Kanos of his charges against the New Republic. She was unaware that Kanos had, in fact, been nursed back to health by D'Asta and his daughter and was living with them for several months. Officially dead to the public (at least temporarily, as D'Asta pointed out, as a man of Kanos's stature was unlikely to remain anonymous for long), Kanos had bought the time needed to recuperate and forge a new life for himself. When the time came for Kanos to go his own way, he left his crimson royal guard robes as a token of his appreciation before departing the planet in a gifted X-wing, saying his only regret was his inability to speak with Sinn. As he left, D'Asta was sure that Kanos would find a new life for himself, leaving the Empire behind for good."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kir Kanos was a cold and brutal individual. He was known to kill without mercy, and felt little guilt about this\u2014if any at all. Kanos had developed these characteristics through a brutal upbringing filled with harsh lessons and images of death from the very start of his career in the Empire. He was also an extremely loyal and dedicated warrior to the point of fanaticism, and mourned for almost ten days following the death of his highly respected Emperor. Kanos felt a unique sense of connection with Palpatine, and his one visit to the Academy at the same time as Kanos's training resulted in the Emperor of the galaxy briefly meeting eyes with Kanos. Due to this, Kanos looked up to the Emperor as a father and was driven by revenge following his death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Kanos seemed uncaring and emotionless to many, he was also known to show brief moments of tenderness, and his self-constructed armor was occasionally broken through to reveal Human emotion. After he had killed Lemmet Tauk, Kanos was genuinely filled with remorse. However, the compassion he tried to show to his fallen brother was met with the harshest punishment by Vader, resulting in his distinguishing scar. While voyaging across the jungle of Xo with Mirith Sinn, Kanos began to have his first traitorous thoughts, and his faith in the Empire was wavered when Sinn confronted him with what she believed to be undeniable proof of their evil and cruel ways. Sinn had a legitimate effect on Kanos, and he seemed to entertain leaving his quest to avenge the Emperor to be with Sinn.
