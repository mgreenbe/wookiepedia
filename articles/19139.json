Unlike most Gungan vehicles, they were not biological in form or appearance, and were instead streamlined, metallic ships. Whereas tribubble bongos were squid-like in shape and movement, Behemoths were massive vessels, requiring two tentacle-like propellers on outriggers to propel them along the surface. Behemoths had limited submersible capability, as they were designed for bombardment, equipped with large booma-throwing catapults. They were constructed at shipyards and cost 200 units of carbon and 150 units of nova crystals. They were first used around the time of the War of the Gungan tribes in 3000 BBY. Later, during the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, several cruisers unsuccessfully defended the Gungan city Otoh Gunga during the Naboo Swamp Battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bongo Behemoths appear in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and its 2002 expansion pack.
