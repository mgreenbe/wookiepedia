Successor to a primitive version of the Intellex ship-configuration computer used by Automata Galactica in P2 prototypes, it was developed as part of Industrial Automaton's efforts to bring the astromech droid to market with minor modifications after receiving fairly positive feedback on those sold to the Old Republic shipping fleet on a trial basis. The Intellex II was created to facilitate the droid's new database system, which was capable of handling new and different types of starships, including capital warships. In addition, technicians included a primitive navigation computer program that could calculate a single jump if given enough time and input."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
