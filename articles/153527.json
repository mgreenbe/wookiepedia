The Jedi recording device captured images and sounds from the conflict, and the unidentified Jedi Master later added his own narration to tie all the data together. The Jedi Master concluded his story on a worried note, stating that the Sith, the eternal enemies of the Jedi, were \"lurking somewhere in the galaxy... waiting for a chance to strike.\" Around the same timen the council member also lent his voice to the recoded version of the Junior Jedi Training Manual."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The unidentified Jedi Council member was created as a narrating device for the book-and-record adaptation of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, in which he was voiced by the American voice-over artist Peter Francis James.
