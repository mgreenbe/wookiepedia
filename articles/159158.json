Vallt was a cold world, with half the planet covered in glacial ice. The climate was often snowy and windy and quite inhospitable to off-worlders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Galen Erso and his team were working on Vallt for Zerpen Industries when the Vallt government was overthrown in a coup by those sympathetic to the Separatist movement. This led to Erso quickly being thrown into Tambolor prison on charges of espionage. The planet thus shifted from being a Republic\u2013aligned planet to a Separatist one during this period."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Outer Rim snow planet Vallt had been a member world of the Galactic Republic for years before the Clone Wars. Whilst it was a member, it did not receive much trade or respect from the government, and also lacked fair representation in the Republic. For around a decade, Vallt's representatives brought this to the attention to the Republic, but this did not change their status. During his time as Chair of the Senate, Mas Amedda served on a committee with Vallt representatives, but did not grant them the support they wished."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vallt first appeared in James Luceno's 2016 novel Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel.
