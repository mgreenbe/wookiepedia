Since he was always on the bridge during a flight, it was their responsibility to receive and look after passengers and guests of honor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3643 BBY, the supply ship was serving on the route between the Vaiken Spacedock and the Imperial homeworld Dromund Kaas when her commander received orders from Grand Moff Rycus Kilran to intercept the Republic warship Brentaal Star and eliminate an Imperial defector. Orzik disregarded this, however, as he considered it impracticable, and continued the course to Dromund Kaas. The Grand Moff found out about battle-hardened passengers and had them contacted by his protocol droid NR-02, who was also on board, in order to convince the captain of the transport ship of the mission or to take over the command of the transport ship directly. Since Sylas would greet all guests of honor personally, he asked her to send these battle-hardened guests directly to him, but did not inform them of the real motives. During the flight, Sylas was on the navigation bridge when it was stormed by these guests and NR-02 and Orzik was confronted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
