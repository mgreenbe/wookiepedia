Regardless if the legend was true, the stones were nonetheless kept in the Kuddaka chamber of the Jedi Temple; here, Jedi could test their telekinetic ability by seeing how many stones they could lift simultaneously. With each stone weighing at least a ton, and the heaviest stone weighing at over five tons, merely jostling a stone was marked as an achievement by a Padawan, with Jedi Knights being able to lift multiple stones at a time. Only masters of telekinesis were able to lift more than four at a time though; with Yoda only being able to lift five after he passed seven hundred years of age, Fae Coven being able to lift six only after entering a deep and long meditation, and Ferleen Snee - if the legend was true - being the only recorded Jedi to lift all seven."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
