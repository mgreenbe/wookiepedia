By 6 ABY, the city had been constructed next to one of the world's canals. Inside the city was a Command center, animal nursery, and Prefab Shelters. The city's inhabitants kept a shard of the Vor'Na'Tu, an ancient Jedi artifact, as a relic. That year, the future Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, along with his sister Leia Organa and a New Republic army, ventured to Hanoon to recover the artifact's remains. They went to Reeche, and the city agreed to turn over the shards for a tribute of 500 units of carbon and 500 units of nova crystals."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic forces gave Reeche the requested tribute, and the city gave up its shard. Later, Organa and Skywalker decided to free the rest of the asteroid and took control of the Terraform Processor. With the demise of Moff Yittreas, Hanoon agreed to join the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Reeche was first mentioned in the strategy guide to the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds.
