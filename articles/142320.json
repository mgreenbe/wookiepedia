The starships had cigar-box shaped hulls with chrome-colored armor plating attached on slidable girders, allowing the armor to be moved around the ship as needed. They were fielded in mixed squadrons with other Tionese ships such as Argaian hemiolias, Cronian battlebirds and Livien cutters in battle. Several star-glaives were deployed alongside a Xolochi Dreadnought in a task force sent to the planet Galuch, and others fought against Hutt yachts at the first battle at the planet Vontor, which Xim's forces ultimately lost. The events of the battle were later recorded in the drama known as The Despotica. The Thanium star-glaives were normally equipped with torpedoes, concussion missiles, and pulse cannons. The hulls of most star-glaives were armored with kiirium, an alloy completely resistant to energy weapons. Bellow the armored surface, the star-glaive was protected by mytag crystalline vertices. Those protected against electromagnetic pulses."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thanium star-glaives first appeared in 2009 in the third part of Xim Week: The Despotica, a series of posts by Michael Kogge on the Hyperspace section of StarWars.com.
