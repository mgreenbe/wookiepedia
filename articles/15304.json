These tabs indicated the battles that a given pilot participated in, and were usually uniquely decorated to reflect the particular battle they represented, or circumstances within the battle that made the participant stand out. The New Republic pilot Tycho Celchu was known to have worn battle tabs on his flight suit for the Battles of Hoth, Endor, Bakura, and Coruscant, with the tab for Endor bearing a black dot that signified his run through the second Death Star."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
