It states to never use violence, even in the face of death. This would almost cause the Lurmen's demise in the Defense of Maridun. However, Wag Too abandoned it and joined the Jedi Knights Aayla Secura, Anakin Skywalker, Padawan Ahsoka Tano, Clone trooper captain CT-7567, and Clone trooper commander CC-5052 in defending Maridun from Lok Durd, a Neimoidian general of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and in doing so, saved his people."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
