The magazine published material that was supportive of the Galactic Empire. TK-7 held the position of Chief Editor Droid in the Digest's Culture Desk, editing and commenting on journalists' stories. Parazeen Parapa, an intern at the Galactic Digest, was sent to interview the bounty hunters Zuckuss and 4-LOM. The publication's server was sliced into, and Parapa's article was published before TK-7 could finish editing it, with the droid's comments still present."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
