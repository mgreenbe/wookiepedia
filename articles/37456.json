Preparation for these charges were known to take time and precision, although significantly confident demolition specialists could quicken the procedure by disabling certain safeties. Once in place, the charges could be detonated via a timer, with a delay of up to six hours, or by a remote signal. If properly placed, they were capable of incapacitating armored vehicles or blasting major breaches within fortifications. The cost of the Destro-6 demolition charge was 750 credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Destro-6 demolition was mentioned in Rise of the Separatists, a roleplaying supplementary sourcebook for the Star Wars Roleplaying series published by Fantasy Flight Games in 2019."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
