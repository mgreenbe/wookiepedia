Korsin grew up during the Time of the Rot and became the leader of the Korsinite League, a faction which revered the Tribe's founder Yaru Korsin and his daughter Nida Korsin. In 3000 BBY, he went to Tahv to celebrate Testament Day, and to stop an attempt by the Sisters of Seelah to alter the Testament of Yaru Korsin to favor their interests. During Testament, the various Sith factions learnt that the ancestors of the Lost Tribe were not \"great conquerors\" but were actually slaves of the Sith Empire.

However, Hilts successfully convinced the other Sith to end the fighting by revealing the existence of a map which showed the existence of another continent known as Alanciar. Yaru Korsin had concealed Alanciar's existence and intended to use it as a \"cause\" to give his descendants a new sense of purpose.

Squab slew Korsin while Edell used the Force to assert control over his remaining followers, ending Bentado's ambitions and ensuring the survival of Grand Lord Hilts. Following his death, the Tribe peacefully annexed Alanciari with the help of the Keshiri man Jogan Halder, Quarra's lover.

Korsin regarded these other Sith factions as \"heretics\" and \"defilers\" and always sought an opportunity to fight against them.

The Sisters had planned to coerce the Caretaker Varner Hilts into producing a fake testament that would favor Seelah and those who followed her. However, this plot failed since the original Testament was a holographic recording of Yaru Korsin during his last moments. Thus, a fake document would not suffice.

The Korsinite League then sparred with the other two Sith factions until they were interrupted by Varner Hilts who tried to bring peace in the capitol building, which was regarded as a neutral meeting ground for the Tribe.

Bentado expressed his agreement with Hilts and then announced that the \"defilers\" had to pay the penalty of death. He vowed to destroy his opponents in combat in the capitol building and its surround grounds, where the other Sith factions had already gathered.

As the Korsinite League's members surged forwards towards Hilts, Bentado vowed that they would hear the found in eight days alone.

When Bentado queried about the time difference, Jaye explained that one standard day on Kesh was one second slower than Galactic Standard Time. This time difference meant that the Standard Calendar was eight days ahead of the Keshiri calendar.

Iliana came to Jaye's defense and argued that the Keshiri was telling the truth since she sensed no deception in him. With Bentado's Korsinite League and Force 57 agreeing with Jaye's findings, Bentado was forced to concede to Hilts, who now could legally convene the Pantheon's Peace.

To realize this destiny, he argued that the Tribe shoud stop fighting, reopen the Sith temple, and return to the stars. The meeting quickly descended into quarrels as the various Sith leaders tried to defend their beliefs and ridicule those of their opponents.

In response, Iliana commented that the Tribe's ancestors had not been conquerors but had merely been \"diggers in the dirt\" and that the Tribe's founder had merely been a \"delivery boy\". Similarly, Neera commented that this was not Sith but madness.

Yaru Korsin had also recorded over this message to preserve this secret. While Hilts was open to telling the true story of the Tribe's origins, Bentado feared that this news would inspire a revolt among the Keshiri.

Edell justified his motivations on the grounds that the Omen had been nothing but a \"carrier of chattel.\" Likewise, Bentado described the starship as the cause of the Tribe's imprisonment on Kesh and an \"omen of despair.\" Despite his earlier fascination with Korsin-era architecture and the Omen, Vrai agreed with Bentado's assessment that the starship had to be destroyed.

When Hilts reprimanded the Sith for trying to destroy the temple which the Keshiri had helped build in the first place, Neera responded that all life was \"profane\". She cited the \"alien masters\" of the Tribe's forebears as an example of how disgusting life could be. Edell, the more moderate of the Sith party, attempted to reason with Hilts by telling him that everything they had known about the Tribe was a lie and that there was no sense in clinging to ancient sites like the Sith Temple since it contributed to infighting among the Tribe.

Hilts succeeded in deceiving Halder into believing that the Sith Tribe were the benign \"Protectors\" and that the Keshiri in Keshtah were happy to live under them. The Sith also told Halder that Adari had been right about the presence of the servants of the Destructors among the Tribe but that these malcontents had been cast out.

This was helped by Korsin's own fearsome appearance and the black leather suits that he and his followers wore; elements which the Alanciari would associate with the malevolent Destructors. Hilts and Iliana regarded the ambitious Bentado as a threat to their rule and thus saw the invasion of Alanciar as an opportunity to eliminate him. Knowing that Bentado and his Ebon Fleet had already departed for Alanciar, Hilts wanted to give the Alanciari a fight that they could win. For his grand strategy of conquering Alanciar to succeed with minimal losses, Hilts had to convince the Alanciari that the Sith were indeed the benevolent Protectors.

Within minutes, several Sith airships had been shot down or destroyed. The surviving Sith crew and soldiers were hunted and killed by units of Alanciari soldiers. Bentado's flagship Yaru was pierced by several flaming javelins and careened towards the eastern highlands, where it crashed and exploded.

Despite the disaster at the Western Shield, Bentado and several other members of the Ebon Fleet managed to survive and regoup. These survivors included several Sith crew from the Yaru and other airships, several Human Sith warriors and a small number of Keshiri ambassadors including Bentado's Keshiri aide Squab.

Even the sentries guarding Vaal Hall were unaware of this development since the Sith were hiding within the building. During their brief occupation, the Sith used this signal station to order the Alanciari to open the compound's gates, deliver food inside the gate, and to bring Sith prisoners to Vaal Hall\u2014a subterfuge used to gather reinforcements.

It was also used to sent orders to all Alanciari signal stations throughout the continent. In addition, it contained a facility for thoughtcriers to transmit and receive signals from all over Alanciar. The capture of the \"worldwatch\" enabled the Sith to control the continent's highly centralized nerve center of signal communications.

To emphasize his point, Bentado used the Force to throw several miniature airships across the table. Bentado argued that the Tribe's founder Yaru Korsin had only succeeded in winning the Keshiri over but had failed to conquer them.

A defensive Bentado responded that the Sith followers in the building were loyal to him. Edell countered that he could not always rely on the loyalty of his Sith followers since they would eventually tire of hiding indoors. Quarra defended Edell by reiterating that the latter had received motivated help. By contrast, she stressed that Bentado would receive no help from the Alanciari since he had killed their leaders.
