Located on the second floor of a building in the town, it was luxuriously furnished. It also had a laser cannon for home defense. In 32 BBY, while searching for an alternative way inside the home of Captain Neg in order to rescue the young Ithorian slave Tomo after being refused entry, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn accidentally ended up in the apartment, where he encountered two of Sebulba's female Twi'lek slaves, a Rutian and a Lethan, who warned him that Sebulba would be angered if he discovered Jinn there. The laser cannon then emerged and opened fire on Jinn, but the Jedi Master was able to destroy it before leaving the apartment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
