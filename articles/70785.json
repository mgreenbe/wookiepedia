In 22 BBY, he served in a Jedi-led battle group of the Grand Army of the Republic that was dispatched to liberate the planet Christophsis from the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Alongside his unit, Jester reconnoitered the planet for a strategic ambush site, but the Confederacy thwarted their planned attack, forcing them to retreat. After the clone troopers returned to the Republic base, Jester cleaned his DC-15S blaster, as he did after every battle. When Clone Captain CT-7567 and Clone Commander CC-2224 questioned the members of Slick's platoon to identify a potential Confederate spy, Jester was nervous about talking to his commanding officers, but fellow soldier Sketch vouched for him, allowing Jester to verify his alibi.

During the Clone Wars, he joined Clone Sergeant Slick's platoon of soldiers. In 22 BBY, in the seventh week of the war, Jester and his unit were assigned to a contingent of the Republic Grand Army\u2014under the command of High Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi General Anakin Skywalker\u2014to liberate the planet Christophsis from the Confederacy of Independent Systems. After the Republic troops established a base, Slick's unit scoured the planet for a suitable site from which to ambush the Confederate battle droids, eventually locating a double-towered business center in Crystal City. On their way back to the Republic base, the platoon came across a squad of B1-Series battle droids that were attempting to clear a major boulevard of Christophsian refugees. When the droids happened upon a crippled Christophsian and contemplated killing him, the clones intervened and disabled the enemy troops."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic forces proceeded to the business complex to set up their ambush, and Sergeant Slick's platoon became based out of the complex's south-facing tower with General Kenobi and Clone Commander CC-2224, while Skywalker and Clone Captain CT-7567 stationed their troopers in the parallel north tower. As the Separatist battle droids passed through the plaza below, the approaching column of droids unexpectedly divided in two, and a contingent of droids arrived in the south tower and ambushed the clones. Skywalker and his men rappelled over to the south tower to reinforce Kenobi's forces, and they took a turbolift to the roof of the tower, where they escaped aboard clone pilot Hawk's LAAT/i gunship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After returning to the Republic base alongside the others, Jester cleaned his DC-15S blaster, as he always did after a battle. Later that evening, CC-2224 and CT-7567\u2014nicknamed \"Cody\" and \"Rex,\" respectively\u2014pinpointed an irregular wavelength in external communications to Slick's barracks, fueling their suspicion that someone in the platoon was a Confederate spy. Consequently, the two officers called Jester and the other members of his platoon back to their quarters to individually interrogate them about their whereabouts earlier that evening. Jester was initially nervous about speaking to his commanding officers, but fellow trooper Sketch vouched for his habit of regularly cleaning his blaster, and Jester presented his freshly scrubbed weapon to Cody as evidence. Eventually, Slick was revealed to be the spy and escaped from the barracks, following which he sabotaged the Republic's gunships, AT-TE walkers, and weapons depot. When Gus spotted Slick heading for the base's command center, Rex and Cody ordered Slick's platoon to secure the perimeter. The two officers thereafter managed to detain Slick."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a Human male, Jester had a height of 1.83 meters and had black hair, tan skin, and brown eyes. Combat taught him the value of his blaster, and the self-disciplined soldier developed a habit of cleaning, scrubbing, and maintaining his weapon after every battle. He was initially nervous about talking to his commanding officers, and at first stuttered while addressing Rex and Cody\u2014in his opinion, he would have rather faced a horde of battle droids than be subjected to an interrogation by his superior officers. After Sketch vouched for him, he became more confident, offering evidence that Cody and Rex could verify themselves. Jester was visibly shocked when his own sergeant, Slick, was outed as the Confederate spy within the Republic's ranks. Besides maintaining his weapon, Jester kept his sideburns carefully tended. He was trained in combat, recon, and military tactics and was also proficient in handling heavy weapons like the Z-6 rotary blaster cannon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jester first appeared in The Clone Wars webcomic Shadowed, following which he was featured in \"The Hidden Enemy,\" the episode of the television series' 2008\u20132009 first season that the comic led into.
