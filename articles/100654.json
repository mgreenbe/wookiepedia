After assisting in the death of Jedi Master Mace Windu and submitting to the tutelage of Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious\u2014known to the galaxy as Palpatine, Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic\u2014Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker fell to the dark side and was anointed Darth Vader. Just afterward, Vader was assigned a detachment of the 501st Legion's clone troopers and was tasked with storming the Jedi Temple on Coruscant alongside them. This massacre, as well as the mandate given to the clones instructing them to kill their Jedi officers in the field, marked the beginning of a galaxy-wide hunt for the Jedi. Most of the Jedi inside the Temple were executed by the invaders while the Temple burned, and within minutes of the Purge's inception, much of the Jedi Order was wiped out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the fighting, Vader altered a beacon that alerted Jedi across the galaxy\u2014the ones that had not already fallen to the clones in their ranks\u2014that the Clone Wars were over and ordered them back to the Temple, where a garrison of clone troopers lay in wait to finish them off. All of the Jedi who complied with the beacon's mandate were killed by squads of clones, some of whom were disguised as Jedi themselves. To prevent deaths, two surviving Jedi Masters, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, infiltrated the Temple and switched the beacon, changing the message to ward away any surviving Jedi and instructing them to go into hiding. With the operation's completion, the bodies of the slain Jedi were publicly burned in a massive pyre in front of the Jedi Temple's public entrance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since their first encounter, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine\u2014secretly the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious\u2014had an interest in Anakin Skywalker, a boy intent on learning the Jedi ways. He positioned himself as a mentor and father figure to the boy in order to influence his decisions. Skywalker trusted Palpatine absolutely, confiding in him his greatest secrets, such as his slaughter of Tusken Raiders on Tatooine, his relationship with Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, her pregnancy with his child, and his visions of her dying in childbirth. In 19 BBY, near the end of the Clone Wars, Palpatine invited Skywalker, who was now a Jedi Knight, to a performance of Squid Lake by the Mon Calamari Ballet in the Galaxies Opera House. There, he recited to Skywalker The Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise, telling him that there were Sith techniques that he could learn to save Amidala. Later, Palpatine admitted to Skywalker that he knew how to utilize the dark side of the Force, and Skywalker realized that he was actually a Sith Lord. The Knight was shocked by this revelation, and he fled to the Jedi Temple to inform Jedi Master Mace Windu, who immediately informed the Jedi at the Temple before taking a squad of Masters to apprehend the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In his office on Coruscant, Sidious was confronted by Windu's group, and all but Windu were quickly killed by the Sith. Sidious and Windu continued fighting until Skywalker arrived. Deciding that Amidala's life was more important to him than his commitment to the Jedi, Skywalker cut off Windu's sword arm to save the Sith Lord, and Sidious threw Windu out of a window to his death. Skywalker then pledged himself to Sidious's Sith teachings, and was dubbed \"Darth Vader.\" Sidious took this moment to carefully admit that he did not actually know the secret to preserving life, much to Vader's chagrin, but assured his disciple that they would find it together. With that, Sidious declared the Jedi Order a threat to the Galactic Republic, assigning Vader the task of marching through the halls of the Jedi Temple and eliminating this growing \"menace.\" A large detachment of troopers from the 501st Legion was transferred to Coruscant to serve Lord Vader during the mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Sidious did not know of Vader's true intentions for taking part in the raid on the Temple. Vader, realizing Sidious had been manipulating him all along after his admission that he could not save Amidala, intended to help destroy the Jedi because he knew they would never understand Windu's death in the context it would help save the one he loved against the will of the Order's tenets. He planned to assist Sidious in his plot to bring the galaxy under his supreme rule only to turn on his new Master once the Jedi were extinguished. Vader knew that the Order would object to the rule of a murderer once he took command, despite his intention of bringing stability to the galaxy's citizens through that means. He resolved that the actions he would take that night were necessary for his goal to come to fruition."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Vader prepared to begin his mission, Sidious enacted Order 66, a mandate that Republic clone troopers across the galaxy had been conditioned to follow without question since before the Clone Wars had broken out. It commanded them to attack and kill their Jedi commanders in the name of the Republic. Within minutes, many Jedi were killed by their formerly loyal subordinates, though some survived the Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jocasta Nu, the Chief librarian of the Jedi Archives, sensed something suspicious that night.

Marching silently to the gates of the Temple with the clones, Darth Vader was met by Jedi Gate Master Jurokk, whom Vader asked about the whereabouts of the Temple's current commander, Jedi Master Shaak Ti. After Jurokk told him that she was meditating in the Temple, Vader killed the Gate Master and led the clones inside. After entering the temple, Vader then demanded that one Jedi draw a lightsaber and become one with the Force, claiming that the Order's plot to \"overthrow\" Chancellor Palpatine had failed, to the Jedi's confusion. Vader killed the Jedi, then proceeded to stalk through the halls. He eliminated any Jedi he encountered while destroying any Marksman-H combat remotes he met that were guarding the Jedi Temple."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the troopers dispersed throughout the Temple's vaulted halls at Clone Commander CC-1119's direction, Vader took a small group of clones to capture the communication center via the Jedi Archives. There, a Jedi Knight named Sha Koon, weary from researching and tracking a Sith the Jedi suspected of manipulating the war, awoke to smoke and a battle raging in the Temple. Though surprised at clones in the halls surrounding the Archive, she felt their intent through the Force and blindly fled deep into the Temple."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon approaching the library, one of the clone units reported in. It informed Vader they were on their way to regroup with him. Vader then engaged two Jedi who created a Force barrier around each other, ensuring Vader could not kill them as they attacked him. However, Vader held them off long enough that the clone unit arrived, killing them. Vader then ordered the commander to take his troops and destroy their ships to ensure none escaped. Vader entered the Temple's library with another contingent of clones and told Jocasta Nu to grant him access to the communication room under the Supreme Chancellor's orders. When she ignited her lightsaber to confront the Sith, citing that only the Jedi Council could authorize access, Vader used the Force to impale her with his own saber, killing her. After the clones had confirmed that all escaping ships had been destroyed, Vader posted clones at all exits to ensure that no Jedi could leave or enter to aid the Temple forces. Vader rooted out any remaining Jedi that were hidden in the library while the troops placed themselves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sha Koon sensed Nu's death through the Force. In tandem, she also identified Skywalker as the perpetrator of this massacre and realized that he had turned from the light to become a Sith Lord.

They were then ordered to pacify the library and defend holobook shelves from Jedi that were trying to destroy them until a content download could be performed to capture the confidential Jedi information and Sith secrets. After that information was taken, the clones fought to acquire a holocron detailing Sith and Jedi knowledge from the Archives, delivering the device to an awaiting Low Altitude Assault Transport for carriage away from the battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Vader's front, a Zabrak Jedi activated a ray shield defense system and hid in a shield-protected room during the carnage. Once Vader had disabled the shields and killed the alien, he and a group of clones were ambushed by a band of Jedi Snipers in a hall. At a clone's suggestion, Vader toppled a large statue to crush the warriors and used a chunk to break his way into a study hall, where his party eliminated several Jedi students and a number of Jedi brutes. When Jedi interceptors were launched in an attempt to cut down the clone force, Vader commandeered an anti-aircraft gun to shoot them down, making his way to the communication center at the summit of the High Council Tower once he had finished off the last ship. He altered and broadcast a beacon ordering all Jedi to return to the Jedi Temple on the High Council's authority because the war was over, leading any who heeded the call to their death at the hands of the clones. Meanwhile, the Jedi Battlemaster Cin Drallig managed to penetrate upper-level defenses, and Vader elected to deal with him, ordering nearby clone assassins to guard the beacon with their lives."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Hunting the Masters and children"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before tracking down Drallig, Vader made his way through the First Knowledge Quarter to one of the many briefing rooms, where Drallig's former apprentice, Serra Keto, confronted Vader and engaged him in a duel.

Vader made his way to the base of the Temple, where he found Drallig guarding a group of fleeing younglings he had been instructing in lightsaber combat in the Room of a Thousand Fountains. After murdering two of Drallig's trainees, Bene and Whie Malreaux, the Sith entered a duel with Drallig alongside his remaining Padawan. After some time dueling, Drallig ordered the Padawan to retreat, beginning to duel Vader personally. Vader mortally wounded Drallig by slashing the Battlemaster from shoulder to torso. The squad of clones accompanying Vader then blasted at the other Padawans that Drallig was protecting, killing most of them. A Zabrak Jedi had also been assigned to protect a group of younglings.

After dueling and disorienting the Sith Lord, she managed to lead a band of Padawans and their Masters out of the Temple and later secured a small number of her charges passage through the Undercity of Coruscant. Arligan Zey, the leader of the clone army's Special Operations Brigade, had gone to the Temple upon hearing of the death of General Grievous\u2014a Jedi hunter and Supreme Commander of the Separatist Droid Army\u2014on Utapau, only to be caught in the battle within the halls of his sanctuary. He made it out of the Temple and found his way back to his offices in Arca Barracks, where his aide, an Advanced Recon Commando Captain nicknamed \"Maze,\" helped him flee the planet.

As they focused the brunt of their attack on the hall, three Jedi Masters, who had taken somewhat of a military command over the remaining Jedi, led the last of the Jedi into the main hall in a final attempt to repel the 501st. The Jedi came out in a sudden charge against the clones, but despite their assault, the three were eventually killed along with their allies by the insurgents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader ascended the High Council Tower to search the Council Chamber for more survivors, and it was there that he found an entire Clan of younglings. A young boy, Sors Bandeam, approached Vader from where the other Younglings, including Shia Letap and Jeswi Ele, had hidden themselves.

Coruscant Rescue Ops were forbidden from extinguishing the fires cremating the Temple, and any ship attempting to approach the Temple was assumed to be doing so with treasonous intent.

He also told them of the Temple's pacification and the clones' efforts across the galaxy to wipe out the organization in the wake of that realization. To fully sway his audience to his cause, Palpatine delivered a speech claiming the Jedi had orchestrated the entirety of the Clone Wars to weaken the Republic so that they could take over the galaxy.

There, Kenobi discovered the group of assassins that Vader had left guarding the beacon and dispatched all of them before reconfiguring the beacon to ward Jedi away.

Several Jedi were among their number such as Dass Jennir, Shadday Potkin, and Koffi Arana, who came despite the message warding them away. Jedi Master Kai Hudorra and a Padawan he had traveled to Coruscant with, Noirah Na, had discarded their comlinks and came unaware of the retransmitted message warning them to stay away.

He would be considered the best of the entire Order by Nick Rostu, a man who served as an officer in the Republic army during the Clone Wars, as well as the greatest hero the galaxy had to offer by the public-at-large. Rostu felt that his death was the reason the Republic fell to Palpatine's dictatorship. Alternatively, people believed newly christened Galactic Emperor Palpatine when he claimed that the Jedi had attempted to dominate the galaxy. He used such remarks to justify the slaughter of the Jedi in the Temple and elsewhere as part of the Great Jedi Purge, asserting that the 501st had been dispatched to the Temple to reason with the Jedi over their attempt to arrest him.

Upon reflection, Vader believed that his actions were like any duty he had performed as a Jedi: he had completed it to the best of his ability and felt no remorse for any of those he killed. In fact, he felt that his mission was more righteous than anything he had done for his former allies. In reality, Sidious sent him to the Temple to accept what he had done there so he could move past it, becoming stronger, and so that he would become docile in his apprentice position.

Luke Skywalker, the son of Anakin Skywalker, would later note in the handbook that it and other printed statements are the only details of the battle he could find, and wished he could find out more about the event. No battle damage or vandalism was ever repaired. The only addition was a landing platform, made to replace the destroyed hangar, which jutted out of the side of the structure. Many pathways in the Temple were permanently sealed by debris, and the building was used to store lightsabers taken from many slain Jedi, among them Tru Veld's. Rumors about the Temple being used as a Jedi prison were spread by the Empire to lure any curious Jedi to the area so they could be captured; Jedi Fy-Tor-Ana and former Padawan Ferus Olin both fell for this ruse.
