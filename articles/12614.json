It looked like a flexible sleeveless vest with several soft, external, sealed pockets or inflated bags. Each of those contained a protective ablative shell with a saline solution rich in colonies of microorganisms, counted in the millions. Those microbes fed on certain forms of energy emision and radiation, including blaster bolts and extreme heat. When facing those particles, the microbes diffused it on contact and at the same time they bred quickly. As the vest would then have a greater number of microbes, its resistance to radiation was also increased."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The microbes could feed on great amounts of radiation, but their lifespan covered only seconds before they died. This, along with several environmental built-in controls, prevented them from overcrowding their bags. Again due to this, the increased protection after feeding on an impact was only temporary. Whenever the microbes were not breeding, they were lethargic, and were very susceptible to cold temperatures. All the microbes in a vest died after a fifteen-minute exposure to a temperature below 0 degrees Celsius, and were useless as protection against weapons other than blasters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Creshaldyne Industries, the company that created the microbe armor, had successfully produced and marketed blast-dampening armors. It offered the microbe armor as a cloth whose protective efficiency increased as it received enemy impacts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Available, albeit not readily, during the Galactic Civil War, the microbe armor was sometimes priced at 15,000, and a recharge of new microbes was worth 12,000 more. The merchandise catalog Galladinium's Galactic Datalog of Fantastic Technology offered this item only to Galladinium Preferred Customers, for 30,000. The item was not recommended by adventurers and soldiers, mostly because it was only useful against blasters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The microbe armor first appeared in Galladinium's Fantastic Technology (1995), a supplement to West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, including an illustration of the item by Robert Duchlinski. It then appeared in Arms & Equipment Guide (2002), for Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Roleplaying Game, and then in Galaxy at War (2009), for Wizards' Saga Edition."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The item thus had descriptions and role-playing stats\u2014albeit different ones\u2014for all the official Star Wars role-playing games. The differences included Galaxy at War suggesting that the pockets were inside the vest; and Galladium not specifying at all that a destroyed vest could be recharged with new microbes.
