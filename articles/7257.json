After a century of Annoo-dat rule, the Rets came to call themselves Annoo-dat and the two cultures largely merged with the Dat-an language replacing Tra'ang'a as the most common language on the planet. To distinguish between the two species, xenobiologists called the Ret Annoo-dat Blue and the original Annoo-dat Annoo-dat Prime. Neither species made such distinctions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The notorious crime syndicate, the Fromm Gang, was based on Annoo and was for the most part composed of Annoo-dat Blue."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
