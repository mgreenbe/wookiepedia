Tano was given the task of looking into the matter, and with help from a few cadets from the Royal Academy of Government of Sundari, they discovered Almec's involvement in the black market conspiracy. She then brought the cadets to the Prime Minister, accusing them of the black market conspiracy and claiming that the Duchess of Mandalore, Satine Kryze was their leader. The cadets were later imprisoned at the Sundari prison. However, Almec was a bit suspicious of Tano and alerted the guards to report to him of any suspicious activities. Almec's suspicion proved right as it was all a plan to expose his activities. After Almec was informed that Tano used a Jedi mind trick on one of the guards to lead her to Satine's detention cell, he and a group of secret service officers arrived and captured Tano.\nThis sergeant was ordered by Almec to put a shock collar on Satine's neck to torture her and convince her to sign a confession of treason and when she refused he ordered the sergeant to bring him the cadets to persuade her otherwise. However, Ahsoka managed to break free and with the help of the cadets overpowered the officers, which were later arrested."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
