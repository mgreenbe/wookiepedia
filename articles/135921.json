They fed specifically on the silicates and complex metals. Three individual stone mites could merge to form a symbiotic ternary that featured a hard shell, which strengthened from electrolytic reactions. As a defense, they could weld themselves to a metallic surface and deliver electric shocks through their feeler tails."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stone mites could be found across the galaxy, including on Tatooine, the Southern Underground of Coruscant, Malastare, Naboo, Havricus, Sermeria, Tynna, Nar Bo Sholla, and Deylerax."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Ord Tiddell, thousands of stone mites infested its capital, Lagabee, with four million planetary residents requesting evacuation.
