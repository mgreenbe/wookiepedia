The droid stood by his Hutt master's side and delivered messages on behalf of his master. After Karagga's death on Nal Hutta, the Herald was eventually discovered and put up for auction on Nar Shaddaa, along with all of Karagga's secrets within the droid. The Herald was stuck in a loop, repeating his standardized warning \"Karagga graciously reminds guests that this area is not intended for visitors.\" over and over.\" Hylo Visz dispatched agents of the Alliance to purchase and recover the droid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
