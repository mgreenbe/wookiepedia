After Princess Leia Organa was rescued from aboard the Galactic Empire's Death Star by Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2, and returned to the hidden rebel base on Yavin 4, Willard greeted them and was glad to know Organa was safe, as when they heard about the destruction of Alderaan, they feared the worst."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When it was discovered that the ship they had used, the Millennium Falcon, was tracked and that the Death Star had arrived.
