They also had a pair of skinny arms ending in four-fingered hands, two forward-facing eyes located at the top of their skull, and antenna-like ears. The mouth of a Yuzzum was wide and filled with blunted teeth. Thanks to their rangy limbs, they were taller than Ewoks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Described as \"dreamy wanderers,\" Yuzzums only used the most basic tools, unlike the Ewoks, who had advanced stone-age technology. They tamed and rode rakazzak beasts to help them hunt \"rugger,\" rodents that hid in tall grasses, which they enjoyed roasted. Yuzzums spoke the language of the same name, and were impressive singers. They brewed a potent wine that non-Yuzzums could only safely consume when mixed with the simpler, sweeter wine of the Ewoks."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Yuzzums in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Native to the plains of the Forest Moon of Endor, some Yuzzums left their homeworld on passing starships and founded populations on other worlds. Long before the Imperial Era, a Yuzzum was present during the arrest of Momin. By the year 4 ABY, a Yuzzum singer named Joh Yowza performed with the Max Rebo Band at Jabba's Palace on the planet Tatooine, while another known as Wam Lufba worked there as an exterminator."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Yuzzums were created for the 1983 movie Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, the last installment in the original trilogy of Star Wars. Originally, they were meant to be featured in the movie as a companion species to the Ewoks on Endor. However, they proved too costly to produce in quantity. As a consequence, only one Yuzzum puppet was built, and it found its way into the background of Jabba the Hutt's palace. When an extended musical number was added in the Special Edition of Return of the Jedi in 1997, the Yuzzum design was revisited through a computer-generated creation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the 2018 replica journal Solo: A Star Wars Story: Tales from Vandor, written by Jason Fry, the Yuzzum are included in a list of \"big bruiser species,\" along with the Wookiees, Houks, and Gigorans. Fry, however, has admitted that he actually meant Yuzzem, the large furry humanoids that first appeared in the 1978 Legends novel Splinter of the Mind's Eye."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
