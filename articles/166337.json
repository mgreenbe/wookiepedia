She was one of the many royal handmaidens in service of the Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala. When Amidala left Naboo for Coruscant, Yan\u00e9 along with Sach\u00e9, stayed behind and helped the resistance there fight back the Trade Federation's invasion.

She was a seamstress, using a loom to craft fabric and yarn into blankets. She worked in a market to sell her products and was skilled enough to dye her own yarn, embroider, and make fabric that was waterproof or even fireproof. At one point, Higin was making blankets for the Theed Hospital when she was approached by Quarsh Panaka, who was the Head of Security for the recently elected Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala. After inquiring about her skills, Panaka asked her to become one of the queen's Naboo Royal Handmaidens. Higin, eager to do good, agreed to serve."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon meeting Queen Amidala and the other handmaidens, Higin was quick to notice that one of Amidala's headpieces could be remade to be lighter and more comfortable if it was made out of Karlini silk.
