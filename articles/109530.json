These Xexto became the Quermians. Sometime later on, the Arkanians moved on and forgot the world. Troiken and Quermia were discovered by the Galactic Republic at about the same time, and their inhabitants at first designated Troiken Xexto and Quermian Xexto respectively. The Xexto were at first in denial at being related to the Quermians, and were later outraged when they learned of the Arkanian deception. The two planets joined the Republic at the same time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Quermia was part of Xim's Empire before its collapse.
