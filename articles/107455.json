As with the earlier Chiss Clawcraft, these wings could adjust to a variety of positions, aiding the starfighter's maneuverability. They folded back fully for docking mode. However, the complex technologies packed inside the wings of the Predator were a maintenance nightmare. In addition, the standard redesigned viewport offered poor visibility due to its narrow horizontal panes separated by thick struts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After much lobbying, the Imperial Navy convinced Sienar to produce Predator-class fighters with classic TIE-style cockpits that were flown by squadron leaders.
