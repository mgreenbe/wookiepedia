After the bounty hunter Asajj Ventress and Jedi Quinlan Vos successfully rescued Marg Krim's two children Vram and Laalee from the Black Sun fortress on Mustafar, Utal reported the incident to his master. In response, Ziton ordered Utal to issue orders to execute their last remaining Krim hostage Tezzka Krim as a warning to Marg. Before Kurg could carry out his orders, Ventress entered the throne room disguised as a negotiator representing the Pyke Syndicate. After receiving the negotiator, Ziton ordered Utal to fetch Tezzka so that he could kill her and the \"negotiator.\" Kurg exited the room before Ventress and Vos reentered the room with Tezzka and assaulted Ziton and his men. After defeating them, Ventress and Vos fled Mustafar with their newly-freed hostages and returned to Krim's stronghold on Oba Diah."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
