After becoming injured when crashing out of the forty-eighth annual Dragonfire Air Rally, Serennian heir Ramil was forced to wear an exosuit, and continued to wear the exosuit after becoming the Count of Serenno. When Ramil organized a mercenary takeover of Serenno in order to turn its people away from the Galactic Republic, he was confronted by his brother, the Jedi Master Dooku used Force lightning to disable Ramil's security droid and exosuit, preventing him from moving.
