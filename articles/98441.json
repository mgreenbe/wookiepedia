It was not very heavy but felt warm to the touch. Red and blue light would explode deep inside the crystal every few minutes, which looked very much like a star going nova in the depths of space. It was thought that the crystal could have perhaps been a Force artifact. Many beings were known to have wanted the crystal, Gordunga and Keith among them. Pothos Fine gave his life to protect the crystal from coming into the hands of Keith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
