Focusing less on combat droids, they instead worked on designing cutting-edge droids for industrial use. Their expertise reestablished Baktoid as a leading force in droid engineering."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droids were active following the fall of the Alliance during the reign of the revived Galactic Empire at the end of the Sith\u2013Imperial War, with maintenance tunnels in Sublevel 12 of Coruscant near Roan Fel's private quarters containing LV8-series guard droids protecting a starship.
