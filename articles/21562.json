The web was so sharp that it was invisible to the naked Human eye. Because of their small size, butcherbugs were prey for a number of larger species, such as lesser bogwings. Covered in a bright green chitinous shell, the butcherbug's two interlocking mandibles could be used to pick up and tear flesh."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A similar species of butcherbugs were found on Lok, as the pirate captain Nym complained of having to wipe the arachnids from the windscreen of his starfighter, Havoc."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
