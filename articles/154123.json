In 19 BBY, this Kajain'sa'Nikto and Finn Ertay dueled two Zabrak brothers, Darth Maul and Savage Opress. In the ensuing fight the Nikto was kicked in the stomach and dropped to his knees. Ertay slid to save her fellow Jedi, but was stabbed in the back soon after. He was later killed as well. The Jedi used Jedi Commander armor along with his Jedi robes and a blue single-bladed lightsaber."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The animation model used was based upon that of Ima-Gun Di. The character's pre-visualization model was used in an alternate battle sequence for the episode \"Nightsisters\", where he would aid in the battle and pursue Asajj Ventress. In this deleted scene he is known as \"Master Ma'kis\", and helps to corner Asajj in a hangar bay onboard a capital ship with Ahsoka Tano, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. Ma'kis became separated from the other three Jedi and had to fight Ventress by himself. The cargo in the hangar bay would hinder the battle, distracting Ma'kis, allowing Ventress to stab him to death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
