Jedi Knight Aryn Leneer hunted down Sith Lord Darth Malgus after Malgus killed her Master, Ven Zallow, during the Sacking of Coruscant. She found him with the help of the smuggler Zeerid Korr, and dueled him first in the ruins of the Jedi Temple. The duel ended in a draw, and Leneer again sought Malgus out, finally creating a plan to lure him to her by attacking his lover, Eleena Daru, in the Liston Spaceport. Leneer knocked Daru out and awaited Malgus, while Korr fled the planet in a drop ship, engaging in combat with its pilot, the mercenary Vrath Xizor. Malgus arrived and again dueled Leneer, finally defeating her with Force lightning. However, he believed that he owed her a debt\u2014she had shown him his weakness in his love for Daru, and thus allowed Leneer to flee. Korr, meanwhile, defeated Xizor, and when the man threatened his family, Korr pushed him out the drop ship's airlock. Malgus then killed Daru to eliminate his weakness, and Korr and Leneer eventually met on the planet Dantooine, where they lived together."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3681 BBY, the Sith Empire launched an invasion of the Galactic Republic, instigating the Great Galactic War. However, in 3653 BBY, the Sith offered to negotiate with the Republic for peace. The truce was a ploy, however; during the Alderaan peace conference, the Sith Lord Darth Malgus had led an attack on the Jedi Temple on the Republic capital Coruscant. The Sith defeated the Jedi there and took temporary hold of Coruscant, establishing a blockade on the world. During the battle, Malgus killed Jedi Master Ven Zallow. Zallow's former Padawan, Jedi Knight Aryn Leneer, was attending the Peace Conference. She felt her Master's death, and overcome with grief and anger, she determined to find and kill Zallow's murderer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leneer located an old friend, former Republic commando Zeerid Korr, and enlisted his help in getting her through the Imperial blockade on Coruscant. He was already planning to go to Coruscant in order to deliver a shipment of engspice, an illegal spice, with a payoff so large that he could retire and live with his disabled daughter. They were shot down while running the blockade, causing the spice shipment to be detsroyed, but they survived, jumping out of the starship while Leneer used the Force to slow their descent to the ground. They then traveled to the ruins of the Jedi Temple, where they found a recording of the attack that showed Malgus killing Zallow. Malgus, meanwhile, traveled in a shuttle down to the ruins, where Leneer met and dueled him. Korr, however, intervened, and fled with Leneer in an airspeeder."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While scouting around the Liston Spaceport, Korr located the Twi'lek Eleena Daru, a slave and lover of Malgus who had also participated in the attack on the Temple. Despite Korr's efforts to convince Leneer to let go of her vengeance and leave the planet with him, she and Korr traveled to the small spaceport. There, they caused a diversion with the help of Zallow's astromech droid T7-O1 and found Daru in one of the hangars. Meanwhile, Malgus began to fear for his lover and traveled to the spaceport, looking for her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The skirmish"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leneer approached Daru, who quickly drew her blasters and opened fire. The Jedi deflected the shots away and knocked the Twi'lek out. Korr attempted one last time to convince her to leave, and although she had finally let go of her anger, she declined. Korr then attempted to commandeer a nearby drop ship, Razor, and fled. Meanwhile, Malgus arrived and attacked Leneer, and the two dueled once more. Meanwhile, the pilot of the Razor, former Imperial sniper Vrath Xizor\u2014who had recently been hired as a mercenary to prevent Korr from delivering his shipment of spice to Coruscant\u2014found Korr on his ship and confronted him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Malgus finally defeated Leneer with Force lightning, knocking her out. However, he declined to kill her, instead deciding that he had simply returned a debt\u2014she had shown him that Daru was a weakness he could not afford. Leneer was surprised by his decision, but she fled the planet. Korr, meanwhile, defeated Xizor in unarmed combat and held him captive. When Xizor began to threaten Korr's family, however, Korr realized that he could not allow the man to live, and pushed him out of the vessel's airlock. Back on Coruscant, Daru reawakened, and Malgus stabbed her through the heart with his lightsaber, knowing that as long as she lived, she would be a weakness for him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Korr returned to his family on the planet Vulta and took his daughter to Dantooine, where he began a new life as a farmer.
