He did this in order quell the rebellious labor force that refused to work for the Empire. He was considered a generous, even lavish host, as was evidenced during a reception in the Verkuylian Imperial Governor's Hall held for the companies that came to build the new bacta refining plant. He had been informed of a New Republic Intelligence team on the planet by Daven Quarle and had him stall Selby Jarrad with a fake order of imposed satellite silence. The order failed, when Selby overheard his conversation with Quarle using an earsculpt listening device. This resulted in Jarrad shooting Quarle and bringing a New Republic fleet to Verkuyl, liberating the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
