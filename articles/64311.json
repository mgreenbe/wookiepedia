In 34 ABY, that unit interrogated \"Prisoner 8910542\"\u2014 the Resistance pilot Poe Dameron\u2014aboard the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Finalizer. The torture bot asked about the location of the map to Luke Skywalker 813 times, until Dameron spat at the droid. In response, the IT-000 used methods 2265, 6304, 3333, and K8-A4 on the prisoner, the last one of which nearly made Dameron swallow his tongue. Eventually, Kylo Ren entered the holding cell and shoved the droid aside to conduct the interrogation himself. When Ren made his captive scream, it shattered the sensory capsules of IT-000-XZ 1594, making it incapable of further recording. The unit then made its report to translator RA-7-D4, not knowing that particular protocol droid was secretly part of C-3PO's spy network."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
