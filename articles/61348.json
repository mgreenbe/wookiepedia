Unlike the more common Aurebesh, which was widely used by all levels of society, High Galactic was typically adopted only by officials and the wealthy, and was often associated with snobbery. It saw use during the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War. It was notably used in certain Galactic Basic Standard holofeeds displayed on the planet of Coruscant, then capital of the Galactic Empire. Algebraic formulas could also be written down in High Galactic letters. The bottles containing the Nabooan wine called Domaine de la Maison sur le Lac also featured High Galactic characters on their stickers. Janyor of Bith's book on propaganda featured examples of persuasive artwork that used both Aurebesh and High Galactic copy executions, and Janyor noted that disparate versions of Saespo Choffrey's Sienar Fleet Systems mural using both of these writing systems were distributed through the outlying neighborhoods and residential districts of Capital City on Lothal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The original version of the 1977 movie Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope contained occurrences of the real-world Latin alphabet. Although those labels were later edited into Aurebesh in the DVD release, the Expanded Universe kept featuring Roman letters in in-universe situations. Eventually, those occurrences were identified as the High Galactic alphabet in The Written Word, a StarWars.com Hyperspace article written by John Hazlett. However, the Expanded Universe has since been rebranded Star Wars Legends, and is therefore no longer considered canon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Regardless, Roman writings still appeared in \"The Gungan General\" and \"Senate Murders,\" two episodes of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars canon television series.
