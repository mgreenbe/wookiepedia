Many Yuuzhan Vong removed their eyes and replaced them with mqaaq'it implants. Mqaaq'its would then shift color depending on the mood of the individual Yuuzhan Vong. Shapers used a variant of these, called maa'its that were similar in function to ocular microscopes. Mqaaq'its could see beyond the visual light spectrum, and also were able to zoom in on microscopic objects."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shimrra Jamaane had mqaaq'it-implant eyes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
