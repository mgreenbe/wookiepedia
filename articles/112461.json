The Alliance was formed in 2 BBY under Chief of State Mon Mothma. A marksman was typically equipped with an E-17d sniper rifle, along with a backup sidearm, Class-A thermal detonators, and an R-4 recon droid. Some snipers were equipped with autoturrets. The marksmen participated in many battles, including the raid on Yavin 4, the Battle of Hoth, and the Battle of Endor. Marksmen were motivated individuals, and a team of them were capable of turning an advancing company of Imperial stormtroopers into a handful of retreating ones using their rifles. Apparently, a disproportionate number of Rebel marksmen were female; similarly, many of the Alliance Military's females were marksmen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rebel Marksmen serve as the Rebel's sniper class in the Star Wars: Battlefront video game series.
