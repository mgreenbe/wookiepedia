Guarded by the 975th stormtrooper garrison, the installation was where the development research was done for the Death Star's superlaser under the direction of Galen Erso as part of the Tarkin Initiative. A team of scientists at the complex undertook two interconnected projects: the fusing of kyber crystal shards into larger forms and the creation and redirection of a controlled chain reaction. Attached to the facility was a single-barrel defensive turbolaser cannon and a shuttle station where cargo shuttles delivered crystals for the team in specialized containers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Operation Fracture in 0 BBY, a Rebel squad consisting of Captain Cassian Andor, Jyn Erso, K-2SO, Bodhi Rook, Baze Malbus and Chirrut \u00cemwe traveled to the facility in a UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft to find Galen Erso. Director Orson Krennic arrived shortly after the Rebels in his Imperial shuttle to investigate suspicions of a Rebel sympathizer within the scientific ranks. After Erso revealed himself as the traitor, Krennic had Erso's team executed by death troopers. The complex was then attacked by rebel starfighters, consisting of T-65B X-wing starfighters and BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bombers from Blue Squadron.In response, the base's defensive cannon and TIE/ln space superiority starfighters were dispatched to counter the threat, only to be overwhelmed by the Alliance as \u00cemwe led to the turbolaser's destruction, allowing for the Rebel strike team's success. Ultimately, an alliance torpedo brought severe damages to Director Krennic's landing platform, killing several stormtroopers and mortally wounding Galen Erso, who conversed with his daughter before the remaining Rebels fled from the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
