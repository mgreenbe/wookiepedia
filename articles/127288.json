He was the assistant of Lord Drowl, and aided him to introduce the Quell toxin to stop a slave rebellion on Dromund Kaas. Even so, Slarin believed Drowl's plan would be leaving the slaves writhing in pain for weeks, and instead introduced a different dosage that would kill the slaves quickly. Slarin tried to give the modified toxin to an Imperial individual instead of the toxin that Drowl had given to them, but the individual insisted on Drowl's version."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
