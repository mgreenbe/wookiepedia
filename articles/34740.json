Before becoming a Sith Lord, he lost everything during the Galactic Republic's war against the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders. He survived the activation of the Mass Shadow Generator superweapon during the war's final battle at the planet of Malachor V, which surrounded the planet with a destructive spatial phenomenon known as a mass shadow. Experiencing the shadow that obliterated almost everything on and around the planet made Nihilus crave Force energy. The affliction painfully ravaged his body while rendering him a wound in the Force. He was found by a seeker of these, the former Jedi Kreia, who became the Sith Lord Darth Traya and told him that she could teach him to feed his endless hunger. He accepted her offer of apprenticeship at the Trayus Academy on Malachor V, where he, over time, became one of three concurrent Dark Lords of the Sith."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Together, they formed a triumvirate with Darth Traya at its head and her other apprentice, Darth Sion, as the third member. The trio chose individual titles for themselves, Darth Nihilus becoming the Lord of Hunger. The apprentices grew in strength throughout their training and eventually overpowered their Master. Sion defeated Traya, while Nihilus sapped her energy. The two Sith then combined power to sever her connection to the Force and sent her into exile. Nihilus' affliction developed to the point where the Dark Lord was forced to call upon the dark side of the Force to encase his spirit within his mask and armor to stay alive. He and Sion then began a Jedi purge, causing the virtual extinction of the Jedi Order. Nihilus was responsible for the devastation of the planet Katarr in 3952 BBY, killing and absorbing the Force energy of the Jedi at the Conclave on Katarr along with every other living thing on the world save one Miraluka woman named Visas Marr. Marr was collected from the surface and Nihilus began to train her as his Shadow Hand."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One year later, Nihilus sensed a growing presence in the Force and sent Marr out to eliminate it. That presence was a female exiled from the Jedi Order, Meetra Surik, who was on a quest to find the few Jedi Masters who had survived the Purge with the aide of Darth Traya, who had put away her Sith trappings and identified herself once more as Kreia. When Marr attempted to assassinate Surik, the exiled Jedi defeated her and convinced her to turn to the light side of the Force in the process. Although Nihilus returned to lurking the fringes of known space, he was eventually tricked by Kreia into initiating the Battle of Telos IV in an attempt to absorb a Jedi Academy that lacked any Force-sensitives aside from the headmistress. Nihilus met a large Republic and Mandalorian fleet at Telos IV that distracted him. Meanwhile, his flagship, the Ravager, was secretly boarded by a small force consisting of Surik, Marr, Mandalore the Preserver, and his Mandalorians. The trio confronted and slew Nihilus in the ensuing duel while the Mandalorians rigged explosives that destroyed the ship. The Sith Lord's armor maintained his spirit and was collected for burial on the Sith homeworld of Korriban, where his soul could be contacted with a holocron of his own creation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Origins"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Human male who would one day be known as Darth Nihilus, Dark Lord of the Sith, was alive at the conclusion of the Mandalorian Wars, a galaxy-wide conflict between the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders and the Galactic Republic.

He was on the planet of Malachor V during the final battle of the war in 3960 BBY, when Jedi General Meetra Surik gave the order to activate the Republic's Mass Shadow Generator superweapon. The generator killed almost everyone on the planet's surface and in orbit nearby."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The future Dark Lord survived the superweapon's destruction of the surface and assumed a dark persona while grieving his losses, in part as a means of survival.

His emotional pain then manifested as an emptiness that swept over his idle body and it soon began to manifest as an intense \"hunger.\" Without intent, he drained the life-force of another survivor. The act was an unpleasant experience for him, but the hunger and his painful memories faded for a brief moment alongside his sickness. Nonetheless, the emptiness returned more relentless and severe than before.

The man was eventually discovered by the Dark Lord Darth Traya, who had sensed him as a wound in the Force. After locating him, Traya explained that it was the Force that fueled his hunger and offered to train him to devour entire worlds to help appease the hunger at her school on the planet, the Trayus Academy. He followed her there and learned the ways of the Sith alongside another prospective Sith. Traya's hungry pupil and her other apprentice each honed different aspects and skills of the dark side of the Force, until they both became Sith Lords. The man took up the name Darth Nihilus, while the second apprentice became known as Darth Sion, and they joined with Traya in the creation of a Sith Triumvirate. In addition, the three each took a unique title, with Nihilus selecting \"Lord of Hunger.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Traya perceived Nihilus' hunger for the Force as detrimental to the Sith's goals. Nevertheless, she taught him how to harness that hunger to make him stronger for a time, as she had promised. Nihilus consumed planets on several occasions, caring only to appease his hunger, allowing the dark side to consume him more and more each time he indulged his ever-intensifying hunger. Alongside his hunger, his power also grew dramatically, until he eventually surpassed his Master. Their views on how to destroy the Jedi Order also became divided, with Sion and Nihilus wanting to destroy them outright while Traya desired a more time-consuming approach. This strained the Triumvirate's already fragile alliance to the breaking point. In 3955 BBY, Nihilus and Sion combined forces to challenge Traya, confronting their teacher in the center of her own Academy. Sion and Nihilus entered the Core and ambushed Traya. Nihilus Force-pushed her into a feature of the platform, after which Sion larruped her into submission. Sion combined his power with Nihilus' to sap Traya's Force energy, cutting her off from the Force before casting her out into exile."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Traya gone, the Sith were left with no defined leadership and her followers fractured into many factions once again, all seeking to claim scarce power. Meanwhile, the two Sith Lords went about destroying the Jedi Order together, though they did so separately and with different vehicles. On the one hand, Sion killed as many Jedi he could find. On the other, Nihilus traveled the fringes of known space with a large fleet of ships that he had ripped from the mass shadows surrounding Malachor V. He made one such vessel, the Ravager, his flagship and led his flotilla to the largest deposits of Force energies he could find, whereupon he sated the hunger within him and further increased his power. Both Nihilus and Sion were successful in their pursuits and they extinguished the Jedi. Four years after Traya's exile, Nihilus and Sion, having been the ones who defeated her, reunited the fractured Sith to take control."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nihilus became so absorbed by the dark side of the Force and his hunger that his physical body began to erode. Knowing that he would succumb to death if he did not act soon, Nihilus ripped his spirit from his body and encased it in the armor he wore, thus allowing the dark side to consume his useless body. Using the Force, the Sith Lord was able to keep his robes, armor and mask together, giving him some form while allowing him to use his Force powers as well as a lightsaber. Apart from that, he no longer had a physical form and became simple, primitive intent. Additionally, the Dark Lord constructed a cubic holocron at some point that contained a sum of Sith knowledge and a number of their secrets."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Encounter with Visas Marr"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Trayus Academy continued producing legions of Sith Lords, assassins and marauders, with Sion and Nihilus at its head. They spread death throughout the galaxy and turned many other Force-sensitives to their cause. What his followers experienced while simply being in Nihilus' vicinity allowed them to leech off other Force-sensitives' Force energy, increasing their own power. He also taught them how to sense their prey across the vastness of space."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3952 BBY, the Jedi Master Atris organized a large gathering of Jedi on the Miraluka colony world of Katarr, which most of the remaining Jedi were expected to attend. After organizing the event, she then leaked the location as a ploy to lure a dark presence that she had recently sensed so that she could destroy it. Atris' plan worked, drawing Nihilus toward Katarr. However, when Nihilus neared the planet, he spoke, his voice a great hunger that the Miraluka could see and feel through the Force. The Sith Lord's hunger overwhelmed them and obliterated the surface of Katarr, wiping out the entire colony and anything else touched by the Force. Nihilus destroyed much of what remained of the Jedi Order, including the Jedi Masters Zhar Lestin, Dorak and Vandar Tokare; Atris herself did not actually attend the conclave, though she was reported to have done so."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As he afterward walked on the surface of Katarr, Nihilus found only a single living being, an injured Miraluka woman named Visas Marr. He put her in a deep sleep and brought her aboard his ship. Days later, Marr awoke, completely healed aboard the Ravager, and approached the Dark Lord. When she asked him why the wave of death had spared her, the Sith Lord did not speak. Instead, he showed her a vision of the galaxy as he perceived it: beings on other planets unable to feel the Force, disconnected from one another and lost in the crush of humanity. To that chaos, the Dark Lord felt he brought order. The vision crippled her ability to see through the Force and carved out the flesh of her vestigial eye sockets. Marr agreed to be trained by the Sith Lord as his Shadow Hand and developed a powerful Force bond with Nihilus that strengthened both; further, they could support or weaken each other in battle."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Onderon and his downfall"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nihilus allied himself with General Vaklu, the leader of a separatist movement that wanted the planet of Onderon to leave the Galactic Republic. He wanted to aid Vaklu in breaking away from the Republic so the planet would fall under his influence and become a staging ground for the Sith. Colonel Tobin, Vaklu's second-in-command, became Nihilus' contact. The Sith Lord also established a base on Onderon's moon, Dxun, inside the tomb of an ancient Dark Lord of the Sith named Freedon Nadd. The tomb contained a dark energy Force nexus upon which Nihilus hoped to feed after his underlings performed a dark side ritual to influence the outcome of the upcoming Onderon Civil War between the separatists and the Onderon Royalists to his favor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In another part of the galaxy, events that would culminate in Darth Nihilus' ultimate defeat took place when Atris, intent on using her as bait for Nihilus, arranged for the return of Meetra Surik to Republic space in 3951 BBY\u2014Surik had been exiled by the Jedi years before for fighting in the Mandalorian Wars. Atris broadcast knowledge of Surik's presence through the Coreward databases, which reached Darth Sion. Nihilus' colleague then pursued her to the Peragus Mining Facility, which was destroyed as a result. The Telosian Restoration Project, an expensive pilot program for repairing the Mandalorian Wars' collateral damage, lost its main supply of fuel, which bolstered support for Republic secessionist movements on planets like Onderon. Surik came under the tutelage of Nihilus' former Master, who had forsaken her Sith identity of Darth Traya and retaken her original name, Kreia, following her exile. Kreia now trained and used Surik against the Sith whilst Surik herself set out on a quest to find any Jedi Masters who had survived the Mandalorian Wars so that they could take the fight to the Sith Lords who had destroyed the Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nihilus eventually felt a disturbance in the Force that only his apprentice could identify. As a result, Marr was sent to defeat its source, Surik, and bring the woman before Nihilus so that he could consume her.

The practitioners were killed, but not before the ritual was completed. Meanwhile, Surik headed to Iziz to support Onderon's queen, Talia. The Royalist leader's palace was invaded by Nihilus' Sith and the separatists.

This was actually a ruse by Kreia to draw her former pupil there while she traveled to Malachor to prepare for Meetra Surik's final lesson. Nihilus' forces, comprised of servants who had been reduced to mindlessness by prolonged exposure to their Dark Lord and Sith warriors, made their way to the planet. The Republic Navy was there to ambush the fleet as it approached, working with the Mandalorians who were there to assist Surik and their Mandalore. Thus began the Battle of Telos IV, a large conflict with fronts on both Citadel Station, the planet's orbiting satellite, and in space. Nihilus realized too late that the Academy was not actually populated by Force-sensitives, though Atris was the headmistress, but his ravaging hunger drove him to attempt to consume Telos anyway."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nihilus' ship was assaulted and boarded by the Mandalorians in a coordinated final strike against the Dark Lord. Mandalore led his troops to board the Ravager, while covered by the Republic forces, to assist Surik and Visas Marr in their advance on the warship's bridge. Four proton bombs were set in strategic locations throughout the ship along their way. Colonel Tobin, his body twisted by exposure to Nihilus' dark powers by this point, attacked the raiders in an attempt to impede them. However, the Onderonian patriot relented when they pointed out that it would only be a matter of time until his homeworld would meet the same fate as Telos if Nihilus succeeded."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his confrontation with the Exile, Marr, and Mandalore, Nihilus attempted to absorb Surik's Force energy, but failed and exhausted himself because of Surik's ability to draw on the Force energy of those around her. They engaged in a brief duel, with the Dark Lord seemingly too strong to defeat. When he stunned the Exile, Marr offered her life in exchange, a show of devotion that stalled Nihilus long enough for the Exile to recover. Marr entered a trance and disrupted her link with her former Master, undermining his connection to the Force through their Force bond. This weakened Nihilus enough that the trio was able to kill him. Before leaving in the orbital shuttle she and her companions had used to board the ship, Marr felt compelled to remove the Dark Lord's mask, wanting to see the face of the one who had wounded her. Nihilus' body then erupted in an aura of dark side energies as the trio left the bridge. Shortly thereafter, the bombs aboard the Ravager exploded and the rest of the Sith fleet was decimated by the Republic. Nihilus' spirit was able to survive inside his armor, not destroyed within the Ravager, which was taken for burial on Korriban, the Sith homeworld.

Nonetheless, the Sith lived on after the fall of the Sith Triumvirate. At least one Sith Lord rose and succeeded Nihilus, quietly ruling as the Republic began to thrive anew. Similarly, the Jedi Order rebounded as well, with Marr and other Force-sensitive companions of the Exile rebuilding it. In 3681 BBY, the Sith and Jedi would once again clash during the Great Galactic War that pitted the Republic against a resurgent Sith Empire.

To do this, she tried to enlist the aid of a smuggler later known as the Voidhound, without revealing its true nature. However, the smuggler supported the Galactic Republic and told a Jedi Knight, Nariel Pridence, that Zare was seeking the box. The Jedi set out to take the box alone and was captured by Hixan, but the smuggler had followed her. In the ensuing confrontation, Hixan and Zare, who had arrived as well, were killed by the smuggler and the Jedi.

The only response he received from Nihilus was a statement in the Sith Lord's language, which his comrades did not attempt to translate, but the three were in agreement.

After he indulged his hunger for the dark side he lost his corporeal form, preserving his existence only by having his spirit linger within his mask and armor.

Ceasing to feel fear and other emotions, he became an entity of pure intent. Nonetheless, Nihilus was still Human enough to have some feelings, as his bond with Marr persisted until their confrontation on the Ravager. She was his only apprentice, and her betrayal was met with much anger."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During combat, Darth Nihilus fought in an aggressive, one-handed style. He had learned some of the greatest of the Sith teachings, but such practices took the form of dependence. They would make him stronger, but only for a time, and he would have to feed upon Force energy to replenish his strength. For this reason, Force-sensitives and worlds rich in the Force would draw him. His reach in the Force eventually extended to a point where he could feel Force users throughout the galaxy to find planets he would then cleanse entirely, killing everything who was touched by the Force. Prolonged use of this power made him a threat to all life, as his craving grew more intense with each feeding. Eventually, Nihilus' hunger controlled him, not the other way around, and the Sith Lord would instinctively feed upon those around him, slowly killing them. Nihilus' very speech caused pain and death to all who heard it, and those who served him became utter slaves in time. His ability was somewhat similar to Traya's influence upon others: the reconvened Jedi Council in the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine inferred that the Sith had somehow learned this ability to feed on the Force from her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Nihilus was adept in many aspects of the Force. He used his dark variant of the Sever Force ability to betray Darth Traya alongside Darth Sion by stripping her of the Force and casting her out of the Sith Order.

He tore it from the mass shadows that surrounded the planet and kept it together even though it had suffered extensive structural damage. Through the Force, Darth Nihilus was able to escape death by containing his consciousness in his armor\u2014an ability that Darth Krayt would inquire of Nihilus' holocron millennia later. He was also proficient in Dark rage, Farsight, Force lightning, Force resistance, Force scream, Force plague and Force whirlwind, among others, such as a dark variant of Force healing called Dark Healing. His knowledge also extended to Sith alchemy: during the second battle of Onderon, Nihilus' sect of Sith followers used techniques that would bend tame beasts to their will.

The desktop icon for the PC version of the game was Nihilus' face. His story was later elaborated upon in a comic, \"Unseen, Unheard,\" featured in Star Wars Tales 24. This was written by Chris Avellone, lead writer of The Sith Lords, and was drawn by Dustin Weaver. Nihilus' background was further explored in the Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide and he received an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia. Nihilus' name and the pronunciation thereof were derived from the words nihilist, meaning one who believes in \"the denial of all real existence or the possibility of an objective basis for truth;\" and annihilate, meaning \"to destroy completely\" or \"reduce to nonexistence.\" In an interview conducted by a Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic fan website, Avellone was asked what his intentions for Darth Nihilus were. Though he did state that his conception of Nihilus' origin story was non-canon, Avellone said he thought of Nihilus as Meetra Surik's \"other half,\" pursuing a different path after Malachor V was torn apart. From a visual design perspective, Avellone credited artist Brian Menze with creating an effective hook for the character and he cited this contribution as one of the particular things that made The Sith Lords a success. Menze himself did not feel his work on Nihilus was very creative: he was asked to give him a mask based on No-Face, a character from Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away film, and it was highly derivative from that. Nonetheless, Nihilus was his favorite of all the characters he drew for the game and he was proud of him. He counted the opportunity to paint him for the cover of Electronic Gaming Monthly as one of the best jobs of his career."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In-game, Nihilus never spoke a clear word; he emitted solely patterns of sounds similar to Atris' Sith holocrons found on Telos IV.

In promotional material for the game, Nihilus was seen as an opposite to Atris. Concept art showed a confrontation between the two, but Atris never actually interacted with Nihilus during the game. In a bug that occasionally occurred when Nihilus died, his body was surrounded by dark side energies, but the body itself did not disappear. A Sith lightsaber, a Dark Jedi Master robe, and a lightsaber crystal could then be found in his remains. In Hasbro's Star Wars Evolutions action figure set, The Sith Legacy, Nihilus was featured with Darth Bane and another Sith, Darth Maul. He had a removable hood that revealed that showed Nihilus' hair for the first time. It was styled in dreadlocks. In The Sith Lords, Nihilus' name was never spoken aloud, but was viewable during the fight with him and in certain written materials. The smuggler's storyline from 2011's Star Wars: The Old Republic included a section on Tatooine that dealt with Nihilus' Sith holocron, in which his name was spoken for the first time. Nihilus' name was also used for the name of two of The Old Republic's servers, though one was called \"Mask of Nihilus.\" Following a merging of servers, there was no longer a \"Mask of Nihilus\" server and the \"Darth Nihilus\" server was used for the French Player-Versus-Player services."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Alternate stories"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though Nihilus' background and motives did not change based on whether people playing The Sith Lords had Surik, their avatar, make decisions in line with either the light or dark sides of the Force, the way his story unfolded could vary slightly.

This article assumes that the former is correct and that his spirit was already inside his armor when he fought Surik. However, the Encyclopedia's entry cast doubt on whether or not Marr was allowed to look upon Nihilus' face before leaving the bridge. Because The Sith Lords had Nihilus' armor destroyed in an explosion of Force energy, it once stood to reason that Marr was allowed to look and brought Nihilus' mask to Surik. It would not have been able to appear thousands of years later in a Wizards of the Coast Star Wars Roleplaying Game supplement, \"The Mask of Darth Nihilus\", otherwise.
