During the Yuuzhan Vong War, someone published a fraudulent holojournal that was claimed to have been recorded by Elegos A'Kla while he was with the Yuuzhan Vong, and made considerable money in selling it. This holojournal contained supposed information on Vong cultural law, such as that a fallen Yuuzhan Vong leader is always immolated. However, as Mara Jade Skywalker pointed out, the Yuuzhan Vong would have smashed every bit of technology that A'Kla took with him and so the journal was fake."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
