He saw action on Uba IV, Dinlo, Rodia, and Alzoc III, amongst other worlds. In the first year of the war, Gree was assigned to escort the captured Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray to trial on Coruscant, but they were waylaid by Separatist saboteurs and a defector from the Republic, and Gunray escaped.

The standard clone education provided basic information on the species of the Republic, but as 1004's sense of individuality developed, he decided to become an expert on esoteric alien cultures. 1004 set about seeking information with such fervor that even the Kaminoan clone masters took notice; but whereas this would normally be treated as an aberration and be removed, a new program was beginning that took advantage of individuality. The Advanced Recon Commando Alpha-17 began a training program for clone commanders, with an eye towards cultivating independence and individual-mindedness. Part of this involved, as a reward, recognizing the commanders with individual names. 1004 picked the name \"Gree,\" after an obscure alien species; he figured that if anyone recognized the source of the name, he would know they shared his interest in alien culture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gree, under Jedi General Luminara Unduli, was put in command of the 41st Elite Corps, part of the 9th Assault Corps.

Gree learned further of alien species and customs, becoming an expert in the subject, and his unit soon gained a reputation as specialists in hostile conditions, alien recruitment, and counterinsurgency operations. They pioneered the use of All Terrain Recon Transports, BARC speeder bikes, and Juggernaut tanks for reconnaissance missions. Throughout the war, Gree occasionally took personal command of the smaller units Sarlacc Battalion A and B as well. At some point in the war, Gree participated in a battle on the planet Tibrin and later took on the double stripe hairstyle, forgoing his naturally black hair to honor his clone comrades who had perished during the battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Uba IV, home to a droid manufacturing plant, Gree faced virus-filled octuptarra combat tri-droids, forcing him and his troops to keep their helmets sealed and breathing filters working. As the war neared the end of its first year, Gree, in charge of Sarlacc Battalions A and B, and under the command of Jedi General Vaas Ga, was deployed to the world of Dinlo. When they were pinned down by Separatist droid forces, the Grand Army's Improcco Company, under the command of General Etain Tur-Mukan, was dispatched to Dinlo to open up an exit route for them between the forest where they were trapped and the delta region of the river where Tur-Mukan established an extraction point. As the battalions set out along the shoreline, Gree and Ga called down air strikes for Improcco.

By the time the commander and his soldiers arrived in Rodia's Senatorial Palace aboard LAAT/i gunships, Amidala and her companions\u2014including Senator Onaconda Farr of Rodia and Representative Jar Jar Binks\u2014had gained the upper hand and placed Gunray under arrest. Gree took the Viceroy into custody, transporting him to Luminara Unduli's flagship, the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tranquility.

Gree ignored him and escorted Gunray in shackles to his holding cell on the Tranquility, where he oversaw the Viceroy's interrogation by the two Jedi. In mid-interrogation, the ship came under attack by Separatist forces; after learning from the bridge that the enemy forces contained boarding ships, Gree ordered Green Company to prepare to repel invaders. The enemy ships lodged themselves in the ship's hangar bay, and the clone forces arrayed there reported back to Gree that B2 super battle droids had entered the ship and were heading for the detention level. Gree and Unduli left to reinforce their position, leaving Tano, Argyus, and his commandos to watch over Gunray. They were able to cut off the advance of a unit of droids outside the detention facility, but soon ran into further trouble\u2014while they had been occupied, Separatist Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress had infiltrated the facility. They arrived to find her in the process of freeing Gunray and imprisoning Tano; though they soon gained the upper hand in numbers, Ventress set off a series of thermal detonators in the engine room and used the distraction to cut her way through Gree's soldiers and escape.

Against Gree's advice, Argyus persuaded Tano to leave and help the Jedi Master."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Argyus soon received a signal by comlink from a now-outmatched Ventress; he turned on his fellow commandos and killed them with a shot, then opened fire on Gree. As Gree went for cover, realizing Argyus had turned traitor, the commando freed Gunray and took him as a shield. Gree disarmed Argyus with his rifle, but Argyus landed a kick on the commander, removing his helmet and disarming him of his weapon. Argyus ridiculed Gree's dedication to orders and explained his own defection, but as each suddenly dove for a gun on the floor, Gree knocked Argyus unconscious.

In the course of investigating the Separatist leader Count Dooku's alliance with the Nightsisters of Dathomir and their assistance in completing his war vessel Devastation, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala was shot down over the planet Christophsis. Gree accompanied a pair of Jedi in their search for her. Their LAAT/i was shot down as well, and Gree ordered the Jedi to leave him and his clones behind and continue the mission. As they left, the LAAT/i dislodged from the cliff where it was perched and plummeted into Christophsis's depths. Gree was able to recover the vessel, however, and arrived in time to assist the Jedi in their fight against the Nightsisters, opening fire with the LAAT/i's guns on the dark Force-users. The Jedi had not found Senator Amidala, though, and they ordered him to find a landing site.

The Republic squad took several All Terrain Tactical Enforcers which, after scaling a cliff face, were able to reach the coordinates of the location provided by Jabba. Upon arriving, both the Jedi and the clone troopers witnessed a crash site of a large capital ship and were stunned by the view of huge masses of ice and numerous starship parts floating freely in the air. Deciding to investigate the unusual phenomena, Gree and several clone troopers used their jetpacks to reach what remained of the ship's hangar, while the Jedi followed them by using the Force to navigate through debris. When the group rendezvoused at the hangar, it was attacked by a Vulture droid, and it became apparent that the crash site attracted Separatist interest as well.

Once the battle droids were successfully neutralized, Gree was able to show his generals the record of the ship's final moments. It became apparent that an individual had used a Telgorn dropship to board a Munificent-class star frigate carrying two classified weapons, stole one of them, and then departed shortly before the frigate was hit by an explosion. The vessel had then crashed on the planet, where the weapon created a gravity anomaly. Soon, Gree also discovered that Asajj Ventress had already visited the crash site and set the remains of the frigate for self-destruct. The Jedi ordered the clone troopers to safety and then briefly dueled Ventress.

Unduli, Offee, and Gree led gunship reinforcements to Skywalker's encampment, from where they were to mount an attack on Geonosian Archduke Poggle the Lesser's primary droid foundry. After landing with their force, Unduli and Offee met with Skywalker and Tano and decided upon a plan to destroy the Geonosian foundry: Unduli and Skywalker would mount an offensive on the factory while the Padawans infiltrated the foundry via the catacombs beneath it and destroyed it from the inside using explosives. While Tano and Offee carried out their mission, it fell to Gree, and Clone Captain Rex, Skywalker's assigned officer, to lead the clone army in the attack alongside their Jedi Generals. To help fight off the Geonosian resistance, Gree brought in some of his best men such as Sergeant Buzz and clone trooper Draa. The Jedi and clones initially met with much success in cutting through the foundry's deployed droid forces, prompting Poggle to send out several experimental ray shielded super tanks. The super tanks stood up to heavy fire from the Republic's AV-7 Antivehicle Cannons and launched a series of missiles at the Republic forces, dealing heavy losses."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Taking cover from the droid rockets, Skywalker and Unduli met with Rex and Gree and ordered them to fall back in order to draw the super tanks onto the bridge leading to the foundry, which Skywalker and Unduli intended to destroy with thermal detonators so that the tanks would be dropped into the abyss below. Gree and Rex complied with their Jedi Generals, who were subsequently able to destroy the super tanks. Tano and Offee, meanwhile, were intercepted by Poggle and a squad of battle droids while planting their explosives at the foundry's reactor, and with their munitions stolen, the Padawans elected to use a super tank to annihilate the reactor, destroying the factory while still inside it. As the toppling factory brought forth a wave of debris, Gree took cover and ordered his men to do the same. Once the debris had cleared, Rex and Gree took a gunship to find Skywalker and Unduli amidst the rubble and helped them in searching for their Padawans, who had been buried under the factory's remains. When Tano used a power cell to boost her comlink's reception, alerting her Master to her and Offee's position, Skywalker, Unduli, Rex, and Gree immediately proceeded to the indicated area. The two Jedi Generals used the Force to lift the debris, rescuing their Padawans and further cementing their success with destroying Poggle's droid foundry."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in the war, Gree and a contingent of clone troopers accompanied Jedi Grand Master Yoda to a farming moon in orbit of the planet Kashyyyk, where the Separatists were using scythe harvester tanks to raze the local farmlands. As his troops engaged the enemy tanks in battle, Gree's forces encountered difficulties when the airborne pollen upturned by the enemy activity began to disrupt the clones' helmet filters. Furthermore, the scythe harvesters made quick work of the Republic's LAAT/i gunships, leading Gree to recommend a retreat to Yoda. However, Yoda was resolute that the moon would be too strategic an acquisition for the Confederacy, and he ordered Gree and his men to remove their helmets while he tackled the problem of their lack of air support. Yoda used one of the native reptavians to reach the roof of one of the scythe harvesters, which he commandeered and turned against the rest of the opposing artillery. Although the Republic won the day, Gree was concerned by the cost of the victory, as the battle resulted in the obliteration of much of the moon's farmlands.

Yoda and Gree's forces encountered Separatist resistance above the world, however. Alerted to the arrival of reinforcements, the Separatists maneuvered a cruiser to block Yoda's flagship from landing. Gree began searching for alternative sites to land, but they were too far from the front line.

The commander would not disobey a direct order from a superior, and he held in contempt those who betrayed their post to the Republic. He was willing to sacrifice his own life to fulfill a mission.
