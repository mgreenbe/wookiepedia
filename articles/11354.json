The B3-A was outfitted with heuristic processors, allowing them an increased degree of intelligence and independence. B3-A units were physically identical to B3 units, but possessed far more sophisticated programming and knowledge of tactics. The droid's main difference from the unmodified B-2 was the addition of two smaller arms located on the hips. Due to the inclusion of a secondary battery, B3-A units had a long range, and were often sent on commando raids to remote planets, operating in teams numbering anywhere from five to twenty. In some cases, the droid was covered in plates of Cortosis for protection."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A single B3-A ultra battle droid was deployed to the Garia Separatist base during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
