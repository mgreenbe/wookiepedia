Like ordinary trees, the beings rooted themselves into the ground and spread their leaf-bearing branches upward, making them tower over two meters in height. Unlike mundane trees, however, the talking variety were able to use their branches as fine manipulators, grasping and using tools, for instance. Members of the species had two large, teardrop-shaped eyes and a large mouth on one side of the trunk. A long, red tongue lay inside the mouth, facilitating the facility of speech. Lids covered the eyes, blinking intermittently. The eyes of at least some of the talking trees were brown in color, as was their bark. Their leaves were green. With eyes and mouth closed, a member of the species easily passed for an ordinary tree."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Society and culture"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Talking trees spent at least part of their time with eyes and mouth closed, causing them to blend into their arboreal surroundings.

The talking tree was well-disposed to the Ewoks neighbors. That year, Bright Tree's Princess Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka was tasked by her father, Chief Chirpa, with throwing a party in honor of a visiting dignitary known as Prince Delby. To help Kintaka with the preparations, the Ewok Wicket Wystri Warrick led the bordok Baga throughout the forest and distributed posters\u2014large leaves with information about the event scribbled onto them\u2014from Baga's saddlebags. Warrick affixed one announcements to the face of the talking tree who lived in the vicinity. With eyes and mouth closed, the sentient being resembled a mundane tree. The talking tree stirred, removed the poster, and responded favorably to the invitation to the party."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
