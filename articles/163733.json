Numerous creatures and vines could be found on the moon, and acid rain was a regular weather phenomenon. After a Nihil attack on the starship Steady Wing, a party consisting of Jedi Knight Vernestra Rwoh, Padawan Imri Cantaros, aspiring inventor Avon Starros, the Dalnan Honesty Weft and the droids J-6 and SD-7 was stranded on the moon after escaping the ship before its destruction. The young party later wound up in a confrontation on the moon with the pirates responsible for the Steady Wing's destruction, managing to capture them, before their eventual rescue."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
