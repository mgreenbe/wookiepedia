While on a mission to intercept Cad Bane's frigate Tano was paralyzed and rendered unconscious by Bane. The bounty hunter placed his Padawan hostage in Stun cuffs, and pulled off one of her Silka bead Padawan braids. Distracted by freeing Tano, Bane escaped the room with the holocron and the Padawans braid. After hunting down Cad Bane, Skywalker and Tano arrived to secure a Force sensitive Gungan child. Bane then sneaked into the Gungan child's room, only to find Tano waiting for him. They engaged in a small fight before he was captured, after which Tano took back her Padawan braid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the bombing of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, Tano was believed to be the perpetrator of these crimes. The Jedi Council decided to cast Ahsoka from the Order, removing her status as a Padawan, stripping her of her Padawan braid as a symbolic gesture, and leaving her a civilian under the jurisdiction of the Senate. The charges against Ahsoka were eventually dropped once the true mastermind was found, leading to the Council apologizing for their actions. Anakin offered to return the Padawan braid that he had kept for her, but to everyone's shock, Ahsoka refused and left the temple and the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Silka beads were first identified as such in the Decoded version of \"Shadow of Malevolence\".
