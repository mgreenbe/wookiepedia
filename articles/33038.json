During the race, Mandrell pulled over in the arena for maintenance and shouted orders to the pit droids in his crew causing one to race round the vehicle and give orders to DUM-4."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "DUM-4 then responded by marching toward the other pit droid in front of the podracer's engines, which immediately sucked in the droid. The engine was completely destroyed, knocking Mandrell out of the race, but DUM-4 survived and was ejected out of the other side of the engine where it wailed in surprise. Like all DUM-series pit droids, DUM-4 was a repair droid manufactured by Serv-O-Droid, Inc. and stood 1.19 meters tall. It had brown plating and a black sensor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "DUM-4 first appeared in the 1999 prequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.
