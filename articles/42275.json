The logic circuits used in its construction were faulty and showed signs of critical degradation across several EV units to the point where it overrode their behavioral programming to favor cold logic and cruelty. These droids began to make utterly ruthless \"logical\" decisions that endangered even the organic staff of the companies they worked for. In response, MerenData issued a recall on the affected batch to have them replaced."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
