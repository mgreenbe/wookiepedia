These two thousand individuals were concerned by the way in which Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine had waged the Clone Wars; along with his accumulation of executive powers and changes to the Galactic Constitution. During the Cantham House meetings, the group created the Petition of 2,000. The petition formally protested Palpatine's actions and demanded he return to the Senate the emergency powers he had claimed following the conclusion of the war. The petition notably demanded the abrogation of the Sector Governance Decree."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The day after the formation of the Empire, Imperial Intelligence arrested sixty-three senators on charges of conspiracy and treason, several of whom were part of the Delegation of 2,000."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Delegation of 2,000 appeared in deleted scenes of Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith.
