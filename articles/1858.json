Around that year, the Grissmath Dynasty established the planet Nam Chorios as a prison colony, but they also seeded the world with the parasitic drochs in order to kill off the political prisoners there. However, the crystalline tsils of Nam Chorios filtered the sunlight in a way that killed most of the weaker drochs and weakened the remainder. In addition, the tsils' nature Force abilities counteracted the life-draining abilities of the drochs, turning them into harmless insects."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
