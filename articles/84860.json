Two were disc shaped and were worn on the hands, while the remaining two were oval shaped and slipped over a user's footwear."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Utilizing a dual magnetic attraction/micro-vibration function, power pitons allowed a user to scale sheer surfaces with very little equipment. In magnetic mode, the function allowed the user to adhere to metal surfaces, and was best used when climbing buildings and other sentient made structures. In micro-vibration, the function vibrated microscopic durasteel barbs into a surface, and was best used when scaling wood, duracrete, or other comparatively nonmetallic substances."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
