During the Clone Wars that erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Divo was an active police officer who held the rank of lieutenant. He displayed both a pompous attitude and rigid, by the book approach to investigations. While Divo's conclusions might have been based on certain facts, his pride made him jump to conclusions before the case was fully investigated and all variables were considered. He was loath to accept opinions or information from anyone else, preferring his own theories. All of this combined to result in the detective's rather low success rate in closing his cases."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lieutenant Tan Divo was assigned to several notable cases including the kidnapping of the two daughters of Pantoran Chairman Papanoida. Though Divo made assurances of his ultimate success in the investigation, his team missed blood on the bottom of Papanoida's Icon of the Moon Goddess during a scan of the chairman's apartment on the planet Coruscant. This prevented Divo from receiving a vital clue to the identity of the kidnappers, and the case from Divo's perspective went cold."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the untimely death of Rodian Senator Onaconda Farr, a blood test revealed that he had been poisoned making it a murder investigation that was assigned to Divo. However, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala was ill at ease with the inspector's dismissal of her attempts to assist and she decided to pursue the investigation on her own along with Senator Bail Organa. After they were attacked investigating Farr's movments at the docks under the derrick major, they returned with an angry Lieutenant Divo to the Senate Building where the inspector placed the senators under the protection of police and Senate Guards. At that point Farr's former assitant, Lolo Purs, came in saying she was attacked by Senator Halle Burtoni of Kamino, a rival of Senator Farr. Divo confronted Burtoni in the Chancellor's office and placed her under arrest for murder. However, Amidala voiced her concern with discrepancies in the case causing Purs to reveal that she in fact was the murderer. After a scuffle, Divo arrested Purs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Divo's daughter Andressa was an agent in the Imperial Security Bureau of the Galactic Empire, but Tan died on Alderaan in 0 BBY when the planet was destroyed by the Death Star. The family's role in law enforcement continued through Andressa's son Exantor, who became a police commissioner of the New Republic on Hosnian Prime."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Papanoida kidnappings"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tan Divo served as a police officer in the Coruscant Security Force which was the police department for the planet Coruscant, the capital of the Galactic Republic. By the time of the Clone Wars which were fought between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Divo had risen to the rank of lieutenant and was working as an inspector, his low success rate on cases notwithstanding."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When it was discovered that the two daughters of the Pantoran Chairman, Baron Papanoida, had been kidnapped, Divo was assigned the case. He and several police droids searched the Papanoida apartments, finding nothing seamingly amiss. Promising to continue investigating, the police left the scene. Papanoida discovered however, that one of his Icon of the Moon Goddess had been moved from its original spot and upon retrieving it, found the kidnapper's blood underneath. This clue allowed Papanoida to locate and retrieve his daughters with the help of Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano. Meanwhile for Divo, the case had gone cold."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Homicides in the Senate"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a speech by Senator Amidala, the proponents of the legislation\u2014including Senators Onaconda Farr, Mon Mothma, and Bail Organa, along with Farr's assistant, Lolo Purs\u2014withdrew to Amidala's office. While enjoying refreshments, Farr choked on his drink and died. The Coruscant Security Force was called in and responded to investigate the suspicious death and Divo was assigned as the inspector on the case. Samples were taken of the drinks, and the forensics report concluded that a poison had been given to the Senator, thereby classifying the death as a homicide. After the Senator's funeral, Farr's political allies were summoned to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's office in the Senate Office Building. There, Divo revealed that Farr had not died of natural causes but had in fact been murdered. Amidala suggested that Farr had been killed because of someone who was angry over the proposed military spending reduction bill. Divo was dismissive of that idea and told the senators to stay out of his investigation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not convinced by Divo's assurances, Amidala decided to pursue her own theory. She began by questioning Farr's political enemies, Senators Mee Deechi and Halle Burtoni. Deechi revealed that he had Farr followed to dig up dirt on the Senator and that the night before his death, Farr had gone to the Coruscant docks for a clandestine meeting. Though reminded by her friends that Divo had ordered them to stay out of the investigation, Amidala went to the docks with Organa. There, they were ambushed and shot at though they did not know the identity of the attacker. The disturbance alerted Coruscant police forces and they responded and secured the crime scene. After arriving on the scene himself, Divo expressed his annoyance at Amidala's actions that not only had she failed to inform him of her lead at the docks, but she had also made his job more difficult by alerting the killer to the fact that the investigation was closing in on the culprit. During the conversation, Amidala came to believe that Deechi might have been responsible for the attempt on her life, as he was the one who had told her about the docks. Though Divo tried to tell her to slow down, she ignored him, and the frustrated inspector followed her and Organa back to Deechi's office. There, they found Deechi stabbed to death in his chair."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to secure the lives of the individuals involved in the case including Senators Amidala and Organa as well as Farr's assistant Lolo Purs, Divo gathered all of them together at the Senate Building and told them they would be placed under the protection of Coruscant police and Senate Guard forces. However, Lolo Purs refused and left the room. Divo questioned the remaining persons about who else had been aware that Amidala and Organa were going to the docks. In response, Amidala stated that the only other person who had known was Senator Burtoni. Though Divo tried to locate Burtoni, she was nowhere to be found."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Divo returned to the senators in time for Purs to burst in and claim that Burtoni had attacked her. Divo ordered the Senate Guards and Coruscant police droids to find Burtoni, and the police conducted a search of her office, without success. Eventually they were able to capture her and bring her to the Chancellor's office, where several individuals involved with the case, including Amidala and Organa as well as Chancellor Palpatine, were waiting. Initial questioning by Divo led Burtoni to deny any involvement in both Farr's murder and the attack on Purs. Divo then revealed that a forensics report indicated that the poison used to kill Farr, one that was lethal only to Rodians, was Kaminoan-made in origin. With that evidence in hand, Divo ordered Burtoni taken away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, at that point, Amidala noticed that since the poison must have been in everyone's drink, Purs should have died as well, as she was also Rodian. Amidala then remembered that Purs had not drunk anything. Purs, feeling revealed and exposed, pulled out a small blaster and took Amidala hostage. When asked why by Amidala, Purs answered that she had killed Farr because of the war he had brought to Rodia and that a new and morally stronger leader was needed. As Deechi had known about the meeting, Purs had felt that he had to be removed as well. Her confession validated Divo's original theory, as it had been a mistake from Farr's past that had led to his murder. During the conversation, Divo, unnoticed by Purs, discreetly activated the police droids outside of the Chancellor's office. They surprised Purs at the door, allowing Amidala to break away and knock her unconscious. The police droids and Divo then took Purs into custody."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Later life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, Divo had a daughter, Andressa, who became an agent in the Imperial Security Bureau of the Galactic Empire.
