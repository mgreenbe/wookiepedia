In the aftermath of Qual'om Soach's attack on the Nalmar crime family, Eelien Kirat decided that protection was required for his top lieutenants. SE4-12, alongside SE4-10, were modified to serve as camouflaged security droids for Kirat and Elana Nalmar. SE4-12 performed their regular duties in addition to being bodyguards. In an emergency, SE4-12 could deploy a blaster rifle hidden in the left arm, which fired from the palm of the droid's hand."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
