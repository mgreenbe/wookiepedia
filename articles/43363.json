Returning to his homeworld, he became both founder and administrator of Refuge City, an active reclamation project that had been intended to return Caamas to a livable state. Adorned in a shimmersilk noble's outfit and a full-length cloak, D'cel always had a breath mask at hand, as he frequently left Refuge City to take long, reflective strolls in the barrens beyond the compound. Like all Caamasi, he rarely lost his composure; but when the strain of managing every aspect of the Refuge City reclamation Project began to get to him, he had a nervous habit of twitching his nose furtively and flexing his fingers in apprehension."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
