Most of the worlds of the Allied Tion were settled during the Expansionist Era or in the early period of the Galactic Republic. The region that became the Allied Tion was traditionally a buffer between the Tion Hegemony and the worlds of the Kingdom of Cron, with the worlds of Lianna, Barseg, Cadinth and Jaminere jostling for influence."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tion Cluster joined the Galactic Republic circa 23,900 BBY, and in the Republic's final years, the Cluster became divided between the Tion Hegemony and the Kingdom of Cron. Both these states joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Several battles were fought here during the Clone Wars when the sector was contested between the Separatists and the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, the Tion Hegemony paid for its support for the Confederacy when the Galactic Empire carved new sectors out of its territory to minimize the risk of Separatism. This resulted in the Allied Tion sector, but the region had little historical identity. The region became known for its manufacturing and trade, and the Allied Tion was actively patrolled by the Imperial Navy, including the Warlord, because of the volume of trade passing along the Cadinth Run, and also because of its vital strategic importance to the Empire, both as a supply base and because of its location on the main hyperlanes between the Core Worlds and the Corporate Sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Endor, the sector and the entire Cluster integrated into Zsinj's Empire. They stayed under Zsinj's control until his death in 8 ABY, claiming independence from the New Republic and the Galactic Empire, including during the Thrawn campaign."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the death of Grand Admiral Thrawn, the sector was under the rule of Moff Gronn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Astrography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The capital of the sector was Jaminere, but the best known planet in the Allied Tion was Lianna, home of Santhe/Sienar Technologies.

The Allied Tion's main intra-sector route was the Cadinth Run, though little of its traffic passed beyond Jaminere to Dravione and the Desevran Trace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Economy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Old Republic, the Allied Tion became the most active sector of the Cluster. During the Empire, it was a seat of manufacturing and trade, and almost 15% of the galaxy's passenger liners hailed from the sector, presumably as part of Santhe Passenger and Freight. Indeed, the Allied Tion was dominated by the Santhe/Sienar corporate family, based on Lianna."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
