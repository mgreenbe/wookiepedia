After Order 66 was executed during the Clone Wars and Chewbacca was captured, Tvrrdko sold him to a Trandoshan slaver named Ssoh. In one Ssoh's ships cells, Chewbacca allied with other Wookiees, took over the ship, and brutally maimed Ssoh. Around that time, he rescued Wookiee children that belonged to Tvrrdko's clan, ending the feud between them. Tvrrdko showed his gratefulness to Chewbacca by carving a portrait of Chewbacca into a large Wroshyr tree on Kashyyyk after the famous Wookiee's death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
