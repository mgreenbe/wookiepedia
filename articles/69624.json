The Jawa tribe dismantled and stole pieces from the Razor Crest, a gunship used by a bounty hunter known as the Mandalorian. After the bounty hunter began attacking them, the tribe fled into their sandcrawler and escaped. While being pursued, the tribe managed to fend off the Mandalorian with their ion blasters. When the Mandalorian later demanded the parts back, they agreed to supply them if he stole a mudhorn egg and gave it to the tribe. The Mandalorian agreed and secured the egg, of which the tribe promptly ate the contents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
