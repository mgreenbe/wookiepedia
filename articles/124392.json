With close ties to Kuat of Kuat, the head of KDY, the Shesh family suffered when the administrator committed suicide in 4 ABY, destroying much of the Kuat Drive Yards in the process. The Shesh family lost wealth, influence and prestige during the subsequent reconstruction efforts and turned to the New Republic, which installed itself on Coruscant in 6.5 ABY. Contracting secretly with the New Republic, the Shesh family gained massively when the remnant of the Galactic Empire retreated from the Kuat system in 8 ABY. Affiliates of the New Republic signed billion credit deals with the Shesh family, who regained their lost wealth and more."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notable members"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Viqi Shesh was a famous member of the Shesh family who represented Kuat in the New Republic Senate from 19 ABY until 27 ABY. Shesh began her career in Kuati corporate marketing but used her family's wealth to fund her campaign for office. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Shesh gained galactic infamy after collaborating with the invading Yuuzhan Vong species, to whom she furtively channeled a large amount of secret information concerning the New Republic in exchange for a role in the Yuuzhan Vong administration. Shesh's dealings came to light during the conquest of Coruscant in 27 ABY and she died shortly thereafter, committing suicide so as to avoid death or punishment at hands other than her own."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
