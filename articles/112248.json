Using the ARC-170 in its dual role as both heavy starfighter and bomber, Razor Squadron pilots tended to fly their vessels more aggressively than their standard clone counterparts in Red Squadron, Blue Squadron, and even Captain Davijaan's Squad Seven. Each vessel carried a three-man crew\u2014a pilot, a co-pilot, and gunner\u2014and an R-series astromech droid. As an elite surgical strike and recon force using advanced hit-and-run tactics against large enemy targets and facilities, Razor Squadron's focus was more on delivering greater and more intense fire-power and less on strengthening defensive systems. Similarly, their ships were configured to provide more power to their weapons. Additionally, ARC-170s were fitted with heavy armor plating and sensor jammers. Another ARC Elite Squad, Bull's Eye Squadron, bore the same style squadron art (with the exception of it being red instead of blue) and used vessels equally suited for both long-range patrols and aggressive assault missions. Razor Squadron's craft were further modified to provide more power to shields and also boasted a class 1.5 hyperdrive due to the fact that their infiltration/recon missions often lead them deeper into enemy territory. Armaments on ARC-170s included two forward-mounted medium laser cannons, two rear-mounted laser cannons, and a proton torpedo launcher."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A small number of the Republic Starfleet's vessels were crewed by squads of elite clone troopers, select clones that were chosen to serve as elite troopers and put through an intense training program that included advanced survival and gunnery skills. These clones were then commissioned to go deep into enemy territory on the most dangerous scouting missions and raids. Based on Coruscant, Razor Squadron itself was an Aggressive ReConnaissance Elite Squadron organized to fit such dangerous mission profiles. The squadron included specially trained attack and recon vessel clone trooper pilots, equally skilled clone commandos, and on-board specialized astromech droids to handle in-flight operations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These squads underwent advanced \"aggressive reconnaissance\" training, as taught by Advanced Recon Commandos, to equip them with the skills necessary to survive the varied and treacherous mission profiles to which they were assigned.

Their chest plates were fitted with forced-ox rebreathers in case of severe damage to their vessel. While the helmets continued to be marked with the squadron's color scheme, the body suit was a medium blue with dark blue chest armor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Troopers were also fitted with Phase II clone trooper armor bearing the same blue striping, as well as enclosed helmets bearing Jaig eyes in the same stylization as their squadron's vessels. This indicates that Razor troopers were chosen from clones who were capable of distinguishing themselves in battle and receiving awards for particular acts of bravery."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Vehicles"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Razor Squadron pilots typically operated a variety of vehicles and vessels, including Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry gunships. During the later stages of the conflict, Razor Squadron was outfitted with ARC-170 starfighters, which they repainted with blue \"tiger-stripe\" wing designs and nose art of the rancor. Mirroring the jaig eye motifs the squad used on their helmets, these markings were most likely derived from the Mandalorian shriek-hawk, thereby further displaying their distinction as having acquired elite status. This decorative style was similar in appearance and color to the design on LAAT/i Gunship used by The Muunilinst 10 during a mission led by Commander Fordo to extract Jedi from Hypori early on during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Razor Squadron roster"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2008, Hasbro produced a Target exclusive Clone Wars edition of the ARC-170 Starfighter action vehicle and the ARC-170 Elite Squad Battle Pack 3-1/4\" action figure set\u2014two pilots, two troopers, and astromech droid R4-C7\u2014for its 30th Anniversary Collection of Star Wars toys.
