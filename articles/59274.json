The weapon fired bolts at an enemy; the most inexpensive type of ammunition was a glass rod, while the more pricey included fragmenting silver bolts. Some models of hand-ballista had a rapid-fire function; the repeating version of the weapon was standard issue for the front-line soldiers of Alanciar. The user of a hand-ballista was known as a ballisteer. However, after the conquest of Alanciar by the Sith of the Lost Tribe of Sith, the Alanciari were disarmed and their hand-ballistae burned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
