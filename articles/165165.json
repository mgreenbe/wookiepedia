Wyvarls were large, bipedal lizards with broad green backs, thick tails, and a single blue eye. The lizard had a nictitating membrane that drew down over its eye when it went to sleep. Wyvarls lived in herds, and when in danger, a wyvarl drummed its tail against the ground in order to warn fellow herd-mates to stay away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 44 ABY, Luke Skywalker found a female wyvarl that had been trapped in a drop-bramble, a plant with poisonous barbs.
