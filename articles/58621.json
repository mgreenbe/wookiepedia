HK-47 became the basis for a new model of HK-series assassin droids: the HK-50. Revan was captured and his memory was erased before this plan could be realized, however, and the production on the HK-50 model ceases for several years. Eventually, the crime lord G0-T0, who was in fact a planning droid previously assigned to Telos IV, discovered the HK-50 manufacturing facility and reactivated it, disseminating the new model assassin droids throughout the galaxy searching for the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During her travels Meetra Surik visited to the Telos factory along with HK-47.
