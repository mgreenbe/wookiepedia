They possessed distinctive horns around their face and could have blue eyes and light brown skin.\nThe Vodrans were turned into slaves or vassals after their world was conquered by the Hutt Cartel, a criminal organization controlled by the Hutts from the neighboring planet of Nal Hutta. At least one Vodran attended the auction of the Jedi Padawan Eldra Kaitis by the Xrexus Cartel prior to the Invasion of Naboo. At some point, Harra the Hutt built a palace on Vodran and consolidated her holdings there by banishing or enslaving the natives."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
