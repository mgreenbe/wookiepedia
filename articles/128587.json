Sont Toipo was then tasked with organizing an angry mob of farmers to find and kill Kitster. Fortunately for Kitster, a spacer traveling through Mos Espa agreed to help him, and hunt down Sont Toipo. Kitster surmised that the mob would consist of six or eight local moisture farmers, but he pleaded with the spacer to only kill Sont Toipo. Kitster hoped that the rest of the mob would run off after he was killed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The traveler agreed, and set out to successfully kill Toipo, while making an effort to spare the lives of the farmers.
