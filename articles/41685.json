During the time of the Galactic Republic, DD 12 was a flourishing construction yard, but following the ascent of the Galactic Empire, operations in the shipyard were reduced to half the yard's capacity and many semi-independent sections of the yard were either powered down or abandoned entirely. However, large amounts of traffic continued to flow to the yard's main sections, in the form of merchants bringing in freighters for repairs, deliveries of materials for use in the construction of starships and shipments of cargo that were temporarily stored in the yard while awaiting transport. As a consequence of the mix of seclusion and high traffic that the yard offered, by the time of the Galactic Civil War DD 12 had became a popular place for clandestine meetings. The yard was regularly used by the Rebel Alliance to meet with Rebel sympathizers from among the Duros species and during one such meeting in the depthes of DD 12, the Duro Shipwrights Guild pledged its support to the Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
