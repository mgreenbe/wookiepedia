Ahsoka, at first, declines, but then notices that the handmaiden that prepared the table set it with utensils even though the Arthurians never use them and might find their placement on the table offensive. Padm\u00e9 also seems confused by her finding and proceeds to question the handmaiden. Upon being questioned, the Handmaiden suddenly pulls out a blaster and fires at Ahsoka and Padm\u00e9. However the Padawan is quick to react and they find cover behind the table, which Ahsoka turns over. Ahsoka rolls into the heat of battle and ignites her lightsabers, with which she deflects a few of the intruder's blaster bolts. A few of them hit the assassin and forces her to reveal her true nature. The Clawdite, Cato Parasitti, activates a secret thermal detonator, that has been hidden under the now-turned over table the entire time. Padm\u00e9 slides the table to Ahsoka, who cuts out the thermal detonator with her lightsabers from the other side. Using the Force, she pushes the detonator outside through the balcony where it harmlessly explodes in the air. Before Parasitti can make her escape, Padm\u00e9 smashes her in the head with a piece of pottery. Ahsoka tells Padm\u00e9 that she reminds him of Anakin. Padm\u00e9 remarks that the negotiations will have to be postponed, to which Ahsoka replies with a suggestion of eating all of the prepared food before it goes to waste."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
