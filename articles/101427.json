After the death of Emperor Palpatine, riots erupted across Coruscant, specifically in Monument Plaza. A twelve-year old Coruscanti named Jak was present with his father Rorak who was killed by Commander Kaw. Jak later staged a rescue from police custody of Lazula, the woman of Level 1313 crime lord Talvee Chawin, in order to gain the crime lord's favor. Jak then used that to procure an EMP device that he placed at the abandoned Dex's Diner to disable the power grid used by Imperial forces under Commander Kaw who were fighting the Rebels for control of CoCo Town. Jak planned on using that time to kill Kaw in revenge for his father."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
