The Houk tries to intervene but the Wookiee shatters his blade with his metal fists. Black Krrsantan hurls the Houk into the flames and grabs the Nikto by the neck. Krrsantan agrees to spare his life after the Nukto shouts that Black Krrsantan is defeated and unbowed.

Until then, Black Krrsantan believes that he will always owe them. While the Wookiee does not want revenge, he believes that all debts must be settled. After settling his debts with the Xonti brothers, Krrsantan says that he wants to come and peel the \"loud-mouthed wordsmiths\", which means the journalists."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Domthro suggests moving to another galaxy but Dixnet discovers that someone has used their Undervine transmitter to broadcast a message advertising an auction for a rare alien artifact.
