He served as an aide to Militarist Senator Ranulph Tarkin and as second-in-command of Tarkin's military, the Republic Outland Regions Security Force. In 44 BBY, Dallin was pulled into the Stark Hyperspace War when Tarkin decided to lead his fleet to a summit with the Stark Commercial Combine, a gang of pirates. The fleet was ambushed by Iaco Stark's forces in an attempted power grab, and Dallin barely made it to the surface of the planet Troiken. There, he joined forces with the Jedi delegation to Stark's summit and held out for several days from the security of an abandoned spice mine. Dallin led Tarkin's army against Stark's forces and developed a deep respect for the Jedi leader, Master Plo Koon. During the fighting, Dallin received a wound to his face. Without access to bacta, the wound left a large, distinctive facial scar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dallin survived the war, joining the Republic's Judicial Forces. After that service, he returned to his homeworld and entered the Rendili Home Defense Fleet, where he rose to command the entire fleet. In the final year of the Clone Wars, Rendili was taken by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and Dallin faced the choice of following the orders of his homeworld's government, now a Separatist puppet, or defecting to the Republic he loved and against which he did not wish to fight. A delegation led by Koon arrived to negotiate with him\u2014and if he would not surrender, to destroy Rendili's powerful fleet rather than let it fall into the hands of the enemy. When Dallin expressed his distaste for the Independent Provisional Government of Rendili, he and Koon were taken hostage in a mutiny led by Lieutenant Mellor Yago. A Jedi team stormed Dallin's flagship, freeing Dallin, who resumed command of the fleet and killed Yago in a gun battle on the bridge. Dallin joined the Republic, but his service was short-lived; shortly after the Declaration of a New Order, Darth Vader executed Dallin, ever loyal to the Jedi, for questioning the new Galactic Emperor's word that the Jedi were traitors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early career"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A native of the world Rendili, the Human male Jace Dallin eventually found himself serving as an aide to Senator Ranulph Tarkin of Eriadu. The fiery leader of the Galactic Senate's militarist faction, Tarkin was committed to reestablishing the Republic Army and Navy. To that end, Tarkin established the Republic Outland Regions Security Force, a \"prototype\" military, modeled on the Galactic Republic's current Judicial Forces. As his trusted right-hand man, Dallin was the second-in-command of the self-styled \"General\" Tarkin's paramilitary forces. Tarkin recruited only Humans into his militia, and Dallin accepted the General's humanocentric beliefs."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Stark Hyperspace War"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The making of the conflict"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the year 44 BBY, the Trade Federation secretly conspired with Thyferra's bacta-producing Xucphra Corporation to create an artificial bacta shortage, driving up prices of the precious medicinal fluid and netting both groups huge profits. However, the smuggler Iaco Stark and his Stark Commercial Combine, a gang of Outer Rim pirates, preyed upon the bacta-carrying freighters of the Trade Federation. Stark then sold this bacta at lower prices, earning a reputation as a hero throughout the Rim, despite his criminal activities. Seeking a resolution to the conflict, the Senate voted to hold a summit between the Trade Federation, Stark, and the Republic regarding the bacta shortage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Tarkin was determined that the crisis would be best solved by crushing Stark's pirates with military force. With Dallin at his side, he entered into an agreement with Representative Nute Gunray of the Trade Federation; Gunray provided the location of the secret meeting, and Tarkin would arrive with the Outland Regions Security Force fleet to destroy Stark. It was Tarkin's intent to lead a smashing military success, proving the value of a standing Republic army and navy and catapulting himself into the Supreme Chancellorship upon returning as a hero."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "A change of heart"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dallin and Tarkin readied their fleet for action. Aboard the flagship Invincible, Dallin awaited Gunray's signal that the conference on Troiken was underway. With its receipt, the armada jumped into hyperspace. Dallin and Tarkin were unaware, however, that Stark had anticipated the betrayal and used it to justify his power grab. A navcomputer virus was piggybacked on Gunray's signal while, at the summit, Stark attacked the delegates. The navigation computers of Tarkin's fleet were scrambled, resulting in most of the fleet missing their destination. Dallin and the Invincible were among the one-third of the fleet that made it to Troiken, where they were badly outnumbered by Stark's own fleet. The Invincible was heavily hammered by enemy ships as the fleet was decimated; Dallin looked to Tarkin for orders, but the Eriadu commander had frozen with uncertainty amidst this sudden upending of his plans. Senator Finis Valorum, the Republic's delegate to the conference, had escaped with Gunray and their Jedi escort, and he contacted Tarkin with instructions to land at Mount Avos and take shelter in an abandoned spice mine inside the mountain. Tarkin angrily refused to take orders, but the Invincible was almost completely annihilated, and after a particularly damaging hit, he relented. Dallin issued the orders to evacuate the troops and defend their escape pods; Tarkin parroted those orders seconds later. The two then escaped in a life pod shortly before the Invincible was destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dallin made planetfall on the Lycinder Plain in front of Avos, where the surviving army troopers fled, entered the mine and began fortifying it while under fire from Stark's forces. They were swiftly joined by Valorum, Gunray, and Jedi Masters Plo Koon, Adi Gallia, and Qui-Gon Jinn, as well as Jinn's Padawan learner Obi-Wan Kenobi. Tyvokka, another Jedi Master, had died as a result of Stark's betrayal. After Valorum called out Tarkin for obliging Stark's trap with his secret fleet, Dallin took an active role in the mine's fortifications, inventorying the group's supplies and organizing the troops."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Koon used his telepathic powers to read Stark's mind, and discovered that Stark and his confederates planned to launch a surprise attack on the mountain. Dallin and the Jedi prepared, and the battle saw many soldiers wounded, but it was a Republic victory as Dallin's troops used the high ground to fend off Stark's advances. Additionally, Koon's telepathy allowed him to know of any sorties and rally the Jedi against them. After the battle, Koon and the other Jedi visited the wounded\u2014healing, comforting, and reassuring them. Seeing the Kel Dor Jedi serve without ego and display genuine concern for the troops broke Dallin of his humanocentrism. Additionally, Dallin was disillusioned with Tarkin after the Senator's failure under fire, his displays of egocentrism, his failure to treat his soldiers as more than tools for his own ends, and the defeatist attitude he was displaying at Avos. As such, Dallin's loyalty began to swing from Tarkin to the Jedi: Tarkin was largely ignored as Dallin began taking his orders from Koon, for whom he developed an immense personal respect."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Under siege"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the battle, the Jedi developed a plan to sneak Valorum and Gunray back to the Republic's capital world, Coruscant, where Valorum would plead for reinforcements. With the Troiken group's communications jammed, they were assumed dead. Dallin begged for Koon to stay, knowing that the troops looked up to him and depended on the Jedi Master for their morale. Koon agreed to stay while the other Jedi accompanied the diplomats, and Dallin led a diversionary battle while the other Jedi escaped from the caves. After aiding the others in acquiring a ship, Jinn and Kenobi returned to Avos, accompanied by Jedi Knight Tholme and his apprentice Quinlan Vos, who had stowed away on a freighter that arrived on Troiken from Thyferra after conducting an investigation of the bacta crisis. Meanwhile, one of Dallin's patrols came across the Xexto Billibango, a native who wished to aid the Republic. He warned them of the threat of challat eaters in the mines\u2014huge swarms of flesh-eating insects. Just in time, the Jedi were able to bring down a section of the caves, trapping the newly awakened challat eaters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to another warning from Billibango, the Republic was made aware of an impending surprise attack by Stark's forces. Enemy troops surged into the caverns of Mount Avos, but Dallin's men rallied against them. During the battle, Dallin was wounded in an explosion; shielding from Billibango spared him from death. Dallin did, however, receive a large gash to the left side of his face. It was stitched up, but as the troops had no bacta, it healed into a large, distinguishing scar. After he awoke in the mine, Dallin spent the rest of the war with half of his face swaddled in bandages."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Koon was able to make telepathic contact with the Jedi Council through his niece, Sha Koon. The Republic refused to send aid, but the Jedi Council worked out a plan. Jedi reinforcements arrived over Troiken soon after, leading a task force of Trade Federation ships co-opted by a promise not to reveal the Federation's role in fabricating the bacta crisis. Stark was telepathically offered amnesty by Koon in return for betraying his forces, which he did. Koon planned to harmlessly trap Stark's army by retreating though the caverns, then sealing the entrances explosively. Dallin commanded the evacuation, but on reaching the exit\u2014the last opening to be sealed\u2014he found that Tarkin had disappeared with the charge that was to have been used to seal the exit. Tarkin, furious that Koon had usurped his command, was determined to go out a hero. He used explosives to clear the cave-in that had trapped the challat eaters, unleashing them on Stark's troops, who were devoured alive. Koon was the last to emerge from the cave, and he sealed the exit behind him with a Force-triggered rockslide. Stark's forces were defeated, and Dallin joined his troops in celebrating the end of the Stark Hyperspace War."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Life in peacetime"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the war, Dallin joined the Judicial Forces of the Republic. By 30 BBY, he was a crew member on the Consular-class cruiser Intrepid. In that year, the Intrepid was called upon to carry a Jedi contingent including Masters Mace Windu, Gallia, and Koon to Kiffex, where they recovered the Jedi Padawan Aayla Secura. Dallin, ecstatic to have Koon aboard, went to see the Jedi Master during the return trip to Coruscant. With Koon were Windu, Gallia, Tholme, and Secura. Secura stared at Dallin's scars, unusual in a galaxy with access to bacta, and he described them as \"battle flags\" from the war. Secura had had her memory erased during a failed mission, and so the group recounted the events of the war to her.

He was interrupted by the ambitious Lieutenant Mellor Yago, however, who insisted that orders be obeyed.

Accusing Dallin of treason, Yago drew his blaster and, backed by several other junior officers, placed Dallin under arrest and took command of the fleet. With a knife to his neck and a blaster to his head, Dallin ordered Koon to disregard Dallin's own life and put down the mutiny. Koon refused, claiming there would be another time.

The core ships were defeated in short order. With that done, Dallin negotiated the full surrender of the Rendili Home Defense Fleet to the Republic.

Dallin, in the front row of the gathered captains, objected, his disbelief bubbling into words.
