It consisted of 37 glyphs, including 6 vowels, 2 diphthongs, 17 basic consonants and 12 consonant clusters. Consonants were constructed by the combination of a long vertical stroke and various hooks or barbs. The vowels were indicated by diacritics which appeared above the consonant which preceded. When vowels came at the beginning of a word or stood on their own, the diacritics appeared alone. Besides the uniliteral glyphs, there were also biliteral or triliteral signs, representing compound consonants like mw or tsw."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Usage"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This variant of Sith writing lent itself to both calligraphy and other uses such as printing and stone carving.
