Users could listen to audio tapes about Subject 1157's development, view visions of the player character\u2014Starkiller, another clone of Galen Marek\u2014and view a countdown clock, which listed the time in Aurebesh before the site's next update. Successful completion of minigames such as mazes or pong unlocked visions, which served as teasers for the game itself and came from in-game videos as well as scenes from 2008's Star Wars: The Force Unleashed. The website was frequently updated with new content."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
