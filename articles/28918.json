It was a great, miry swamp pool with especially heavy vegetation. Several odd columns of plant life, arranged in a geometric pattern, marked this spot. The pool was used as a governmental ground for the Ergesh species. Once every month, the leaders of all the clans gathered at the Communal Pool for a continuous 40 hour meeting, in which all planetary business was conducted. Each clan leader brought one other Ergesh as an aide and ceremonial security guard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
