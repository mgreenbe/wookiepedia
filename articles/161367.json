She was a friend of Leox Gyasi, captain of the Byne Guild ship Vessel. When Gyasi returned to Coruscant after the Great Hyperspace Disaster which had temporarily paralyzed hyperspace travel, he noted that the Rushlight Equinox was on-planet and told Affie Hollow he was eager to swap stories with Vishla about what her crew had done while grounded. However, he suspected that any stories her crew had to tell were less interesting than the adventures of the Vessel's crew aboard the Amaxine station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
