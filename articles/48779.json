The situation worsened greatly after one of the factions introduced the voracious Lugubraa, a common mercenary species of the Unknown Regions, into the area's worlds. Many Croke settlements were destroyed by the Lugubraa, who reproduced at an alarming rate, and soon began to feed out of control. The Croke, in an effort to wipe out the invasive species, purchased genetically modified Lugubraa, known as blind berserkers, from the cloners of Kamino. These clones, however, proved to be just as problematic as the original Lugubraa, and caused further devastation to the Croke Reach."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Explume Minor was one of the colonies attacked by the Lugubraa, and Firtha's last transmission was to order the evacuation of the Croke nestlings from the colony.
