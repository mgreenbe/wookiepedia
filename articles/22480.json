In the Temple, they were greeted by numerous Sith warriors led by Karyt's lieutenants, Darth Talon and Darth Stryfe. Sigel Dare was wounded in the fighting and Wolf Sazen died during his duel with Darth Stryfe but managed to take the Sith Lord with him. Cade managed to defeat Darth Talon who fled to warn Krayt of Skywalker's arrival and his new power in the Force, with Cade following her. Cade knocked her unconscious with a Force push and confronted Krayt. The two engaged in combat. During the fight, Krayt used Dark transfer to bring Cade to the brink of death. Skywalker saw a vision of Krayt's intentions\u2014Coruscant devastated, his friends dead, and him becoming Krayt's minion and later host body. Krayt admitted to Cade that Roan Fel's plan to use Omega Red on Coruscant was his idea too, for the Sith were unaffected by it. Reviving Cade, Krayt was sure that he had succeeded in turning the young Skywalker to the dark side of the Force. Cade announced that he did understand, that he saw the vision, had no doubts, and now knew his place in the galaxy. He then suddenly summoned his lightsaber and leaped around, skewering Krayt in the heart and killing him for the last time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
