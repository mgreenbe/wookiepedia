It was equipped with a serving tray, for serving drinks to customers along with the astromech droid R2-Q5. Sometime before the Galactic Civil War, Galen Marek found the blind Jedi General Rahm Kota in the Vapor Room, after searching Nar Shaddaa, Ziost and other planets. Marek needed his knowledge of fighting the Galactic Empire for his Rebellion, but Imperial forces found the two Jedi. The droid was caught in the subsequent fight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "R2-P3 appears in the 2008 Star Wars: The Force Unleashed video game.
