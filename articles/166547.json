Nerfworks hoped the ship would revolutionize space transport, but while able pilots, the droid brain lacked the negotiating fervor of sentient captains. They also all too frequently became lost during hyperspace jumps, arriving at their programmed destination sometimes weeks, even months late."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ycaqt droid brains also had a reputation for 'prissiness' similar to that of most protocol droids and tended to get trigger-happy with ships that refused to maintain a respectful distance.
