A Republic transport had gone missing in the Fondor system. Attacked by the Empire, the survivors managed to escape in a small shuttle. An Imperial fleet was called in to destroy the shuttle in order to cover up the Empire's aggressive actions, which were in violation of the Treaty of Coruscant. Calling for aid from the Republic, the conflict was resolved when members of the Coruscant Aegis arrived, protecting the shuttle until its escape to hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Operation Midnight Freedom appears as one of the Space Missions available in the MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic.
