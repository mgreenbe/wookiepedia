The TrailMaker, which came in both a military and civilian version and employed a giant TurboToo repulsorlift engine, was the chief market competition for both of Aratech Repulsor Company's popular military bikes, the 74-Z speeder bike and the Yellow Demon 100. However, because of the TrailMaker's larger size and noisier operation compared to the 74-Z, the bike did not gain widespread acceptance among Imperial scout troopers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
