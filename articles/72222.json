It was placed as a defense for the rear of Zozridor Slayke's forces, six hundred meters behind his command bunker and the army's main defensive position, and benefited from a three-hundred-sixty-degree field of fire. Judlie was the only one of the five redoubts not to be overrun by the Separatists at any time during the battle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
