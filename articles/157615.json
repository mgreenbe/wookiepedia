He owned a cantina on Pamarthe. Greer Sonnel, a native Pamarthen, and Joph Seastriker entered the cantina when Joph claimed he hadn't been to Pamarthe in a while. The tavern-keeper then forced him to drink Port in a Storm to prove that he was a Pamarthen, but instead Sonnel drank it, earning cheers from the tavern-keeper and other cantina patrons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
