In 3957 BBY, the Viscount was assigned to be the lead ship of a small Republic fleet, which had assembled near the Republic's border with the Sith Empire. The fleet waited there to rendezvous with a group of agents who had been sent to the planet Sernpidal, in order to obtain command codes that would allow the Republic to bypass the sensors of the Sith fleet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the agents' starship arrived at the rendezvous point, it hailed the Viscount with an authorization code, and four Aurek-class tactical strikefighters then escorted the agents into the Viscount's hangar bay. Once the agents had disembarked, they were greeted by a group of Republic soldiers and led to a conference room, where several high-ranking Republic officers had congregated, to plan their next strike against the Sith. The Jedi Knight Bastila Shan welcomed the agents, then briefed the officers on a plan to engage the Sith fleet and capture Darth Revan, the leader of the Sith Empire. Afterward, the Republic fleet departed from the meeting point to face the Sith fleet, and during the resulting battle, the Republic agents launched from the Viscount in Aurek strikefighters. The operation went to plan, and Shan was able to apprehend Revan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Commanders and crew"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Various species were represented among the Viscount's officers, including Bothans, Duros, Humans, and a Cathar.
