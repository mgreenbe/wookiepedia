When one of the participants, Tarro Blood, murdered Braden and Jory, Grataa was able to watch the recording of the incident and began an investigation. When he met the bounty hunter named Rarsk, he gave the selected Trandoshan instructions for the Great Hunt. However, Mako grew suspicious after she and her companion killed Rarsk who was tracking a Republic scientist. Upon returning to the palace, Mako initially reacted nervously at his presence, but the Kaleesh calmed her and explained the motives of their actions. He then gave the hunter and Mako a pass to enter a shuttle which would take them to Dromund Kaas, the capital of the Sith Empire. Since Blood did not break the tournament rules, Grataa promised to keep an eye out for the Mandalorian."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
