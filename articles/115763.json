He intended to get some information about the Hammertong, a prototypical part of the Death Star II laser. Eventually, the Mistryl Shadow Guards wouldn't allow him to take the part of the weapon with him, but Winward stole their astromech D4, along with a technical readout of the device\u2014promising politely to return it once the Alliance had acquired the information."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2.5 ABY, he and Rathe Palror were ordered to look after a load of blasters smuggled to Derra IV by Haber Trell and Maranne Darmic. On their way, they were captured by the Imperial Star Destroyer Admonitor. Captain Dagon Niriz instructed them to deliver an unknown load to Coronet, Corellia. While on Corellia he and Rathe got into a fight they nearly lost with the Brommstaad Mercenaries and even told Corran Horn why anyone should join the Rebellion.
