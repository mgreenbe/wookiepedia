It was often used in locking mechanisms for boxes and chests as a security measure, either to keep a container from being opened and stolen from or to seal in hazardous materials."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition, it was found in many high-security doors and, sometimes, encompassing entire rooms or chambers, such as the garbage compactors aboard the first Death Star. Magseals were also frequently used to secure prison cells and chambers in the form of an energy shield, like the prison cages aboard the bounty hunter Bossk's ship Hound's Tooth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The most unorthodox use of magseals was probably in the armor of the clone shadow troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic.
