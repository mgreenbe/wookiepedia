In the year 20 BBY, a conflict waged between Quarzite's two native species, the Belugans and the human-like Kage. The elite Kage Warriors were known to raid Belugan subtrams, and Rigosso's elite troops proved to be ineffectual against them. At some point, the Belugans kidnapped the Kage female Pluma Sodi, whom Blank planned to make his bride."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, with Blank's men outmatched by the Kage Warriors who would likely attack Sodi's escort, the Belugans turned to outside help. For a fee of 600,000 credits, Rigosso hired a team of six bounty hunters led by the up-and-coming hunter Boba Fett to come to Quarzite; the bounty hunters were initially unaware, however, that their assignment would be to protect Sodi from Kage rescue attempts."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Safe cargo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to Quarzite's highly pressurized atmosphere, Rigosso met the team of bounty hunters\u2014Fett, Bossk, Latts Razzi, C-21 Highsinger, Dengar, and Asajj Ventress\u2014at a space station built outside of the planet's atmosphere. The station contained a massive turbolift that descended below Quarzite's pressurized surface, where the Belugans and Kage lived. Rigosso introduced himself to the bounty hunters and briefed the group on the mission objectives, the Kage, Lord Blank, and Quarzite's peculiar atmosphere.

Rigosso stressed that under no circumstances was Sodi's box to be opened, lest the hunters learn of their cargo. Sodi was moved into a passenger car with Rigosso while the hunters spread out across the tram alongside two other Belugan guards. As the Belugans feared, the subtram fell under attack from Kage Warriors riding milodons almost immediately after departure.

Rigosso's concern for Pluma Sodi's safety lay only in the interest of Blank receiving a healthy bride.
