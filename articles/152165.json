The Jedi tracked the individual to a Commerce Guild station, where the Bpfasshi was then cornered by Jedi Minch. The Dark Jedi taunted Minch about his size, as a consequence, Minch angrily fought the Bpfasshi. The young Jedi was bested by his opponent only to be saved by four other Jedi, who arrived just in time. Thus, the Dark Jedi killed himself with his own lightsaber rather than reveal the location of his Master, causing Minch consternation at his inability to defeat his opponent alone."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
