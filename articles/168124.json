Their thrusters had malfunctioned, however, and after Fargil offered the brandy and tabac as a bribe, the Star Destroyer pulled them aboard with its tractor beam so they could repair the ship. Once the crates were offloaded, the the YT's true purpose was revealed: two Chadra-Fan, three Jawas, and four Squibs came out of Gone to Pieces's smuggling compartments to head onto the Interdictor and steal hyperdrive parts for Gone to Pieces, and the Rebel Alliance.
