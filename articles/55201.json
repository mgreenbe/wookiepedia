It meant that the pilot who had recited the code would ditch his or her starfighter and let the astromech droid take it on a suicide run. It was usually used only as a last resort. During the Battle of Eidolon Base, Tycho Celchu used this phrase when his X-wing was badly damaged by TIE/IN interceptors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
