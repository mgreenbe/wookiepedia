Kyle Katarn steals a Lambda-class Shuttle from the Imperial attackers and flies to one of the asteroids. There, he breaks into the control room and redirects the asteroid's fire to the other. With the other asteroid destroyed, he circumvents the weapon's cooling system, escaping just before the asteroid explodes. While on the artificial asteroid, he finds information on the planet Dromund Kaas, which has some importance to the Empire. He travels to the planet to investigate, leaving Mara Jade to carry out several missions for the New Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mara's first mission is to negotiate with Ka'Pa the Hutt concerning the New Republic's supplies. In order for Ka'Pa to comply, Mara is forced to steal the GCT, a device belonging to Ka'Pa's rival, Takara. While looking for one of Takara's lieutenants, Abron Mar, in the Katraasii Spaceport, Mara is trapped by Mar. She is thrown into a prison cell but manages to break out of her cell and retreat into a series of pipes. The pipes lead to the lair of a rancor kept by the pirate group. Retrieving her lightsaber from behind the cage door, she slays the rancor and escapes with the device."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Afterward, Mara is assigned to a New Republic Corvette guarding a Jedi Holocron.

The ship carries her to Rathalay, where she reclaims the Holocron and escapes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Kyle having been absent for quite some time, Mara travels to Dromund Kaas to find him. The planet's dark side aura leaves Mara's weapons useless, except for her lightsaber. Fighting her way through a large swamp, she reaches the Dark Force Temple. There, she encounters Kyle, totally maddened by the dark side. Mara and Kyle duel several times, Mara as the victor. Kyle retreats deeper into the catacombs, finally reaching the temple's throne room. Mara pursues Kyle, finally confronting him inside the throne room. Mara then voluntarily turns off her lightsaber and leaves herself open to Kyle's attack. Kyle is unable to kill Mara and rejects the dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Realizing his mistakes, Kyle let his Force powers atrophy.
