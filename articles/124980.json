They then captured the crew of the ships and used a process called entechment to draw the life forces out of their captives and then transfer them into their droids, ships and computers. Most vessels of that class had one large entechment lab for enteching prisoners and giant batteries for storing these enteched energies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Battle cruisers also had five meter tall ceilings since the Ssi-Ruuk were very tall. There were also several tunnels and passage ways for the P'w'ecks, a species conquered by the Ssi-Ruuk, to get around the ship and do their duties. Since the P'w'ecks could not be trusted, battle cruisers had stun traps to ensure that the P'w'ecks followed their orders and keep out of the ship's sensitive areas. These stun traps could cause terrible pain to the P'w'ecks and kill a Human."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Conductive nets were also used to stop energy surges and to maintain a stabilized gravity since the Ssi-Ruuk were not advanced enough to install artificial systems onboard their starships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known Ships"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
