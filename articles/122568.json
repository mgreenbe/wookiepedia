Before the Council, he is told that they need a spy in the Senate to spy on Senator Rush Clovis, who is suspected of being a Separatist supporter. However, they can't afford to have Jedi taking official action in this, thus they need to convince Padm\u00e9 to join their cause, as she is close to Clovis. Though Anakin doesn't believe that she would be right for the job, the Masters insist on him appointing her, because she trusts him; Yoda attempted to enlist her earlier but was rebuffed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next day, at the Senate, Anakin locates his wife, who is obviously resentful of him leaving her last night.

He assists them with getting seated on the ship, preparing a seat for Padm\u00e9, and breaking the one next to it, so that it can't get fastened. On takeoff, he jerks the ship around to prevent Clovis from kissing Padm\u00e9 again."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As soon as they arrive on Cato Neimoidia, they are greeted by Neimoidian Senator Lott Dod.
