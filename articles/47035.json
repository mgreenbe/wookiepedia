A magnification attenuator, it used lightsaber technology inside a sniper rifle, which allowed its user to take out targets from a hundred kilometers away. The very existence of such a weapon earned Oo'ob and Var-Whill an excommunication. For a time, the Farkiller was kept on Red Mist, a Slinani Migration Shrine located in the Outer Rim Territories, until it was stolen by the rogue archaeologist Chelli Aphra, who stole it and put it up for sale on the Shadow Market."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
