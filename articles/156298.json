The Droid Crush Pirates were recruited by the Sith assassin Ochi of Bestoon to hunt the Sith Lord Darth Vader on the planet Mustafar as part of a punishment from Vader's master, Emperor Palpatine. The captain intended to hunt Vader for the parts of his cybernetic suit of armor, but realized that his suit was composed of standard parts. The droid captain confronted Ochi, who was pulled through a doorway by Vader. While the Droid Crush Pirates forced their way through the door, Vader retrieved his lightsaber from Ochi. The droid pirates were sliced apart by Vader, with the captain being the last to be destroyed. As the droids lay broken on the ground, one remarked that Vader's parts had to be special, but the droid captain denied it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The droid captain was eventually repaired, continuing to lead the surviving droids of the Droid Crush. Some time later, the Droid Crush worked alongside the assassin droid IG-88. At the droid settlement of Zee-Nine City Seven in Hutt Space, the droids assisted IG-88 in a skirmish against Vader and Ochi, who was by then serving the Sith Lord, and the captain was outraged by its former associate's betrayal. After Vader managed to defeat IG-88, the droid captain recovered the assassin droid's head and fled with its crew, promising to kill Ochi at a later time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
