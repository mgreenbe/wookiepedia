The Commander was part of the troop complement of the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Devastator, Vader's flagship.

This stormtrooper helped lead the 501st Legion as the assault commander during the boarding and securing of the Rebel starship. He reported the ongoing attempt to breach the Tantive IV's entry locks to Vader and escorted him to the main hangar of the Star Destroyer to board the captured vessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stormtroopers captured Rebel Captain Raymus Antilles and took him to the assault commander, shortly before Vader boarded the ship accompanied by Commanders Praji and Jir, who also participated in the operation. When the Dark Lord arrived in the corridor where the prisoners were being held, the assault commander introduced the Rebel Captain to Vader. After consulting with one of the other commanders, the assault leader quickly returned to Vader, who was interrogating Antilles, and reported that the Death Star plans were not in the Tantive IV's main computer. Antilles denied Vader's accusations of intercepting illegal transmissions before dying by the Sith Lord's hand. The enraged Vader ordered the assault commander to search for the plans more thoroughly and to bring him the vessel's passengers alive. Although Organa was captured by stormtroopers just minutes later, the stormtroopers were unaware that the stolen plans were already on their way to Tatooine in an escape pod with Organa's droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the stormtroopers took Antilles to the assault commander, the stormtrooper abused the captive Rebel by physically striking him and flouting his surrendering without putting up a fight.

The character's line was performed by disc jockey Terence McGovern, said over a walkie-talkie and recorded by sound designer Ben Burtt.

However, in the radio drama, the \"Commander\" boards the Tantive IV before Vader, and in Star Wars Manga: A New Hope 1, Praji and Jir enter after Vader, revealing that the person who captured Antilles cannot be these two, and is in fact the character of the unidentified stormtrooper commander."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
