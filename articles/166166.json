It was situated between the Delle and Ifmix systems on the super-hyperroute known as the Perlemian Trade Route, which served as a dividing line between the regions known as the Northern Dependencies and the Slice. In addition, around 22,000 BBY, hyperlanes connected Yabol Opa to the Belnar and Perave systems. That set of smaller hyperspace routes persisted until the Great Sith War of 3996 BBY but had ceased to exist by the onset of the Mandalorian Wars in 3976 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Space surrounding Yabol Opa was explored between 27,500 BBY and 25,000 BBY, and the planet had become a member of the Galactic Republic by 22,000 BBY.

The Grand Warden\u2014and the absolute ruler\u2014of the University of Yabol Opa at that time was Solokin Sakellar, who maintained a skyscraper lodge on the galactic capital, Coruscant.
