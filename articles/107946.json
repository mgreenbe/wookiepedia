This route connected the Shapani Bypass with a majority of the sector. It originated in the Freeworlds Territory at Tallaan, where it also intersected the Giju Run. From there it passed through the Mecetti Province, and the Reena Province before terminating at Reena. Along the way several other minor routes branched of from it. Such as the Three Ellas Run at Tavya, the Calipsa Run at Estaph, the Leozi Route at Javis and the Caloria Run at Reena. Other notable worlds on this route included: Neona, Reyna, Procopia, Obulette, Tumus, and Bianas."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
