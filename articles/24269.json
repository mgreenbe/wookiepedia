Using Todo 360's security chip for the temple, and schematics of the temple from the Sith Lord, Bane and Parasitti made their plans for the heist. Bane had Parasitti pose as Jedi Knight Ord Enisence, to infiltrate the Jedi Archives to help them from the inside."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Enisence, Parasitti was able to make her way into the Jedi archives. There, she ran into Padawan Ahsoka Tano and after exchanging some words, told the young Padawan to leave her alone. She then proceeded to the library and gained access to a computer terminal, where she assisted Bane and Todo in bypassing the security systems. However, they were soon discovered and the Jedi Temple was put on high alert. When librarian Jocasta Nu informed her of the matter, Parasitti knocked her out and took her form. It was not long however, before she was discovered and confronted by Tano. Despite her best efforts to fight her off, Tano was able to subdue her. It was then that Parasitti told her that Bane was trying to get into the Holocron Vault. After Kenobi and Skywalker failed in stopping Bane from stealing the holocron, Parasitti told them about Bane's next target; Jedi Master Bolla Ropal."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Later in the Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 20 BBY, Parasitti was out of Jedi custody, and was present in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina on the planet Tatooine."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Disrupting negotiations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, Parasitti attempted to disrupt negotiations with Arthurian delegates in Padm\u00e9 Amidala's apartment.

However, she made a mistake by setting the table with utensils, which the Arthurians never use, and was noticed by Ahsoka Tano, who was there for security. Parasitti attempted to kill Amidala by setting the detonator off, but that was soon foiled by Ahsoka and Amidala's teamwork and the explosive went of harmlessly in the air above the balcony of the apartment. Parasitti attempted to run away and was stopped with a piece of pottery, in the hands of the Senator, bashing her in the head and knocking her out."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Clawdite bounty hunter, Cato Parasitti stood at 1.79 meters tall.
