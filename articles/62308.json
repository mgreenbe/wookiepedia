A Homonculous was 50 centimeters tall, with venomous claws, mottled green skin, and bat-like wings sprouting from its upper shoulders. Those who created a Homonculus could share its senses and communicate with it from great distances. When a Homonculus died, it dissolved, leaving behind only a skeleton and a green mist. Dhar Bullwin used such a creature, stowing it aboard a scout vessel that was bound for Koda's World."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
