It provided intelligence and money laundering services to the criminal cartel, as well as organizing and funding archaeological research and recovery on ancient starships from the Expansionist Era and the Sith War. Sufficiently interesting vessels were sometimes stolen by To-Sharr shipjackers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
