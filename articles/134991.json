Before the conflict began, Nym expressed his dislike of the ceremonial Armor he was wearing, thinking it was too small, and told Jannik to \"stick to the script\". Loreli Ro was observing the conflict with the Grand Protector. During the conflict Jannik was in too deep and Nym told him to fall back, but he refused on the grounds of being Clan Leader, which caused the rest of the crew to be cut off. Because they didn't follow the \"script\", Nym opted to \"improvise\" and charged straight to Evo's Ceremonial chair pushing it over and causing Evo to fall out. As both Jannik and Nym were surrounded by enemy warriors, Nym pulled out a thermal detonator and grappled Jannik and himself up into the air leaving the detonator behind to explode, killing all clan members, Evo included, and causing a crater. The Grand Protector, seeing no sign of Nym, declared that the battle was a draw until Nym appeared behind him drawing a blaster pistol. The Grand Protector, also seeing Jannik alive with Nym, declared that Jannik won, but Nym then dropped his armor and stole the War Chest to Jannik's disgust. He told Nym \"I'll have your head on a Pike\" and every clan will hunt him down."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was revealed later that Nym only pretended to steal the chest from Jannik for the cameras and was in the middle of giving Jannik his share of the profits when Loreli approached them, hoping to recruit him to apprehend Sol Sixxa.
