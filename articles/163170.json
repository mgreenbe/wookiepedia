These gunboats were remote-controlled from Fsir's freighter the Saltbarrel, and performed a false attack on the Saltbarrel at a skirmish for which Senior Captain Thrawn was present. The false attack was meant to convince Thrawn that Fsir was under attack by Vagaari pirates and delay the Chiss officer from discovering the plot against the Ascendancy. Thrawn did not fall for the ruse, and ended up arresting Fsir and commandeering the Watith gunboats and the Saltbarrel. Thrawn later employed the commandeered starships at the skirmish above Hoxim."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
