The droids succession managed to effectively cut off 400100500260026 from HoloNet communication with the rest of the galaxy, and also managed to block all forms of traffic in and out of swath of territory in Gordian Reach. Not long after the secession, the Republic's Supreme Chancellor Tol Cressa was able to organize a successful recapture of the planets which had been under control of the rogue G0-T0 droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
