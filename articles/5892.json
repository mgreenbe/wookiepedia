Quell asked General Hera Syndulla for permission to operate her new squadron from the Lodestar, Syndulla agreed but made it clear that in return for her support, Alphabet Squadron would be under her direct command and not Caern Adan's."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For the next few weeks, Quell put her team through training simulations, which failed to meet Quell's expectations as an ex-Imperial pilot who was trained at the Academy and used to discipline and procedure. Slowly, the team improved enough for Syndulla to approve space flight training sorties. Individually, the pilots were good, but they were not effective as a team, and both Quell and Syndulla knew it.

After intense fighting with TIEs, the squadron killed Shadow Wing's leader Colonel Shakara Nuress, and detonated the station's reactor, which caused Orbital One to break apart and fall towards the surface of the planet and light up the mining pods on the rim of the station. The battle was over, however the falling debris remained a threat to the inhabitants below.

The squadron split into two task groups, with Kairos, Lark and Tensent aiding the ground forces in capturing the guerrillas and destroying their hideout on Troithe, which they managed to do before the Imperials could get an alert out. Quell and Chadic's target was in an asteroid field that hid a dozen TIE fighters and a cargo shuttle. They entered into a skirmish with the TIEs. The rest of Alphabet joined the skirmish in the asteroid field. Afterwards, they swept for survivors and scanned all comm frequencies to make the cargo shuttle hadn't sent a distress signal, before returning to Troithe."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Attack on Cerberon"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the 204th Imperial Fighter Wing, initiated a surprise attack on the New Republic forces within the Cerberon system, while Sundulla was absent with the Temperance, Alphabet Squadron scrambled their starfighters to protect the Lodestar, albeit without their commanding officer Yrica Quell, following her arrest, and Kairos, following her injuries in a previous battle. The Imperials setup a diversionary attack, which saw the Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier Aerie and a squadron of training drones led by Colonel Soran Keize, lure Alphabet and Meteor Squadrons into a fight above Catadra, leaving the Lodestar vulnerable to attack from the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Edict above Troithe. Before reaching Catadra, Wyl Lark received a warning from an enemy TIE pilot nicknamed \"Blink\", to return to Troithe, just as the Edict emitted system-wide jamming, preventing all communications and sensors. Lark raced back to warn the Lodestar, with Nath Tensent, when he realized Shadow Wing was the enemy. With the New Republic starfighters above Catadra no longer a threat, including the complete destruction of Meteor Squadron, Shadow Wing launched all their TIEs, hidden within a debris field, and attacked the Lodestar, which crashed on Troithe, along with the Edict after the planetary defenses crippled it. Shadow Wing's TIEs snuck down to the city while the planetary shield was momentarily offline. The attack was an enormous loss for the Alphabet Squadron, which resulted in Chadic getting shot down over Catadra, and Lark and Tensent shot down over Troithe. Furthermore, New Republic forces had been scattered across the system and suffered many casualties."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Alphabet Squadron first appeared in the 2019 canon novel Alphabet Squadron, authored by Alexander Freed.

When asked if this meant that Alphabet Squadron was present at the battle during an interview with Alex Damon of the Youtube channel \"Star Wars Explained\", Freed claimed that at least one Alphabet squadron member was at the Battle of Exegol, coining both the ideas that it could be known characters or a legacy squadron, although his statement did not determine the author Carson's intent in including Alphabet Two."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
