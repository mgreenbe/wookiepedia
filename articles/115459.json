During that time, the Rhokai stole a lizard that was later stolen from them in turn by the Bad Batch, a unit of former clone commandos working for the informant Cid, whose client wished to acquire the lizard. The clone troopers successfully obtained the lizard from the Rhokai, who sent three vessels to pursue their transport, the Havoc Marauder, through space. After a brief firefight between the Rhokai ships and the Marauder while the clones attempted to bring their hyperdrive online, the Bad Batch were able to escape into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
