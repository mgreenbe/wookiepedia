While the more recent The Essential Guide to Warfare has the length at 3 kilometers, to better fit with the quote in The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime about being nearly twice the size of the Mediator, the model from Starship Battles and the entry in Starships of the Galaxy, Saga Edition show the Viscount as a 17 kilometer long ship designed to be equal to various Star Dreadnoughts. While other ships do have a difference between versions, such as the Praetor I-class Star Battlecruiser being 4,000 meters vs the Praetor II-class at 4,800 meters, or the various sizes of Bulwark-class battlecruisers, a 3,000 meter ship does not fit well into the class named for it at 17,000 meters, even as a prototype model."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
