First Sergeant Hazram Namir once called them \"morons who could make a hydro spanner backfire\". In 3 ABY, they managed to smuggle a droid into a city surveillance center on Haidoral Prime and broadcasted a message to the citizens, telling them about the 61st's open recruit. They also assisted Namir's squad during the first day of the Coyerti campaign when they attacked an Imperial camp. They doubled as a heavy-fire team during a raid on an Imperial heavy freighter. Following the loss of the Thunderstrike, they set up sniper emplacements to guard the search teams who were picking up survivors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zab's squad appeared in the novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
