He claimed the dish was one of his favorite Hutt foods and provided the Huttese translation for it in the section of his book detailing the language. Baobab described Hutt cuisine as expensive in the book, claiming that it should be eaten with gloves, but that utensils were necessary. He also stated that the cuisine was consumed casually in no particular order. The dish was served along with other Hutt delicacies at a feast held by the Hutt crime lord Popara Anjiliac Diresto in his penthouse on the planet Nal Hutta in 19 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sand gizzars were first mentioned in the 2001 book Galactic Phrase Book & Travel Guide written by Ben Burtt.
