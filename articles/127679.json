It was taught by a flight commander. One of the class's exercises involved students riding on speeder bikes through a series of Reitgen Hoops in Galactic City nearby. Imperial cadets were awarded fifty points for winning the race. On one occasion, the Imperial cadets Ciena Ree and Thane Kyrell got their bikes stuck together but still managed to come first place, sharing the prize and scoring twenty-five points each."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
