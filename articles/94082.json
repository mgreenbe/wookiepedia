The scores of the spin-offs have been written by various different composers. The music for the films are especially distinctive as it has been known to paint musical pictures of such accessibility and precision, and Williams's invaluable contribution to the triple-trilogy and story films stands as an unsurpassed feat in the history of film scoring in terms of breadth, thematic-development and cultural impact."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The scores utilize an eclectic variety of musical styles, many culled from the Late Romantic idiom of Richard Strauss and his contemporaries that itself was incorporated into the Golden Age Hollywood scores of Erich Wolfgang Korngold and Max Steiner. While several obvious nods to Holst, Walton, and Stravinsky exist in the score to A New Hope, Williams relied less and less on classical references in the latter five scores, incorporating more strains of modernist orchestral writing with each progressive score. The reasons for Williams's tapping of a familiar Romantic idiom are known to involve Lucas's desire to ground the otherwise strange and fantastic setting in well-known, audience-accessible music. Indeed, much of the trilogy's success relies not on advanced visual effects, but on the simple, direct emotional appeal of its plot, characters, and, importantly, music."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Star Wars is often credited as heralding the beginning of a revival of grand symphonic scores in the late 1970s. While to ascribe this feat single-handedly to Williams is premature, the popularity and impact of the scores was a major contribution. One technique in particular has had a particular influence: Williams's revival of a technique called \"leitmotif\", which is most famously associated with the operas of Richard Wagner and, in film scores, with Steiner. A leitmotif is a phrase or melodic cell that signifies a character, place, plot element, mood, idea, relationship, or other specific part of the film. It is commonly used in modern film scoring, as a device to mentally anchor certain parts of a film to the soundtrack. Of chief importance for a leitmotif is that it must be strong enough for a listener to latch onto while being flexible enough to undergo variation and development."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Principal leitmotifs"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Composed for the original trilogy"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "First appearance in Episode IV"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "First appearance in Episode V"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "First appearance in Episode VI"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Composed for the prequel trilogy"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "First appearance in Episode I"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "First appearance in Episode II"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "First appearance in Episode III"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Composed for the sequel trilogy"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "First appearance in Episode VII"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "First appearance in Episode VIII"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "First appearance in Episode IX"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Composed for the anthology movies"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "First appearance in Rogue One (Composed by Michael Giacchino)"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "First appearance in Solo (Composed by John Powell)"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Diegetic music"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Concert suites"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Soundtracks"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Star Wars score was recorded in eight sessions at Anvil Studios between March 5 and March 16, 1977 by the London Symphony Orchestra.
