Because of its antiquated status, its usage or possession was hardly regulated. A black-powder pistol had to be reloaded after each shot, making it largely ineffective in modern combat. Black-powder pistols were unreliable and required frequent maintenance.

A set of 50 shots of ammunition could be purchased for 5 credits per set."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The black-powder pistol was usually found in a collector's items or functional museum reproductions, some of which were made by Yctor Arms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
