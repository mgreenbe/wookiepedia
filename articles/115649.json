It was where eventual New Republic pilot Wyl Lark had been raised. At some point, the Polynean reached out to the Alliance to Restore the Republic to send one of the finest sur-avka flier from each of the planet's communities to serve with the Rebellion until Polyneus was free of the Emperor's shadow. Whilst other villages held competitions or allowed others to step forward and let the elders choose, Ridge did neither. Instead Lark, despite the offer of another who acted out of kindness to Lark, left the village to serve their people, making an oath to return when the Empire was defeated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
