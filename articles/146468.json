Jacen Solo learnt this technique and revisited the final days of Anakin Skywalker to find out information about his fall to the Dark side. This ability still had its risks; if time-drifters were seen by those they visited, it could create shifts in the flow of time by altering the visited individual's actions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
