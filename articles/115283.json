Rex's experiences with Krell forced him to reappraise his rigid adherence to orders\u2014however, this had not been the first time Rex had questioned his purpose and orders. A notable example had been during the Battle of Saleucami, when he allowed the clone deserter Cut Lawquane to stay out of the war. Rex used his combat skills and training to help train local insurgents on Onderon to emancipate their world.
