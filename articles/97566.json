Holding the rank of Commander, Nemb participated in Operation Cobolt, a mission to retrieve an Imperial Scandoc decoding computer from an orbital base over Mantooine. Starfighters were deployed to draw the base's complement of TIE/LN starfighters away to allow a Marine assault force to capture the device. The operation was a success, but Nemb was badly wounded and his fighter damaged. Nonetheless, he heroically brought his damaged ship back to the rendezvous point, but died before he could be treated for his injuries."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
