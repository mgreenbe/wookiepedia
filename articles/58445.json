In 16 ABY, after a visit to a small shop called the Galactic Archives in Trader's Plaza, Talos spaceport, on the planet Atzerri while searching for information about his mother, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker boarded a courtesy cab operated by the shop to shuttle him to their central distribution hub. In the vehicle, Skywalker saw an advertisement for the H'kig book of laws alongside others for Principles of Power, the Sith book of offerings and rituals, and a publication that claimed to hold the secrets of forming group minds like the Bilar species. Although the shop promised a discount for the purchase of three or more volumes, the Jedi surmised that the books were frauds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The H'kig book of laws is mentioned in Shield of Lies, a novel written by Michael P.
