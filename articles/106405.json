The fighter saw action during the Battle of Exegol, where he used it to lead the Resistance to stop the Xyston-class Star Destroyers of the Sith Eternal's fleet, the Final Order, from taking off to conquer the galaxy. Once the battle began, Poe Dameron used the fighter to engage several TIE/dg starfighters that took off from the Sith Star Destroyers in order to clear the way for the Exegol landing team to land on the ground so they could destroy the navigation tower. However, the navigation signal was switched on to the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Steadfast so Enric Pryde could guide the fleet out themselves, forcing Finn to call off the ground invasion but deciding to launch an assault on the Resurgent Star Destroyer. Poe Dameron rallied his wingmen including Temmin Wexley to provide cover for the landing ship to allow Finn and the rest of the fighters to land safely. As Finn and Jannah engaged the Sith troopers so they could try to destroy the navigation signal, Poe's X-wing destroyed a few Sith TIE fighters to provide support for them. Poe then ordered the rest of the pilots to hit the Sith Star Destroyers themselves as they believed that help wasn't coming."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Resistance began to take heavy casualties as swarms of Sith TIEs shot several fighters down, leaving Poe distraught without hope. However, Poe then heard Lando Calrissian on the comlink saying that there were more of them, allowing him to fly the X-wing to a safe position, realizing that Lando brought in a huge fleet to aid the Resistance. Poe then rallied all of the pilots to hit the underbelly cannons of the Sith Star Destroyers, and it turned out that the battle was turning the tide. Their arrival wasn't too long as Darth Sidious, back to his normal self, used Force lightning to disable every ship, including Poe Dameron's X-wing. As Poe Dameron's X-wing was electrocuted by Force lightning, he began losing control of the ship as he tried to contact for help. The X-wing's control systems were then brought back online when Poe told the others that they had one last chance to take down the Sith Star Destroyers' cannons, just as Rey harnessed powers from the spirits of past Jedi to take Sidious down in one last stand. Following the destruction of the Steadfast, Poe used the X-wing to take down the remaining defenseless Sith fleet and tried to rescue Finn and Jannah, but Lando arrived at the rescue. The Resistance began to return to base to celebrate their victory."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Poe's X-wing first appeared in the 2019 film Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker.
