Repurposed by renegade mercenaries left on the surface of Makeb after the events of the Conquest of Makeb, the giant droid was left to defend its new master's large cache of isotope-5 in its former master's courtyard. Similar to its sister-model Toborro's Glittering Fury, it was able to fire a deadly stream of laser light at a distance and release a destructive cloud of radiation for anyone who chose to engage it closely. Despite the immense firepower it was able to discharge, it was defeated and destroyed after Toborro's death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
