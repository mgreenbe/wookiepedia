It was operated by Nofre Ecls, the sister of Loro Ecls, who managed the Gelgelar Free Port."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was located near the main docking ports of the starport. The repair bay was filled with heavy machinery and fabricators, along with bins of spare parts. It had a large, sloping metal roof that prevented rain from coming in and had small windows that allowed natural light into the building. It housed five Z-95 Headhunters that were used by the Sullustans as a defense force for the port. Large sliding doors closed off the hangar and were only opened to let ships in and out. There was an office in the back corner that Nofre used to oversee operations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The business was entirely staffed by Sullustans and they were all competent mechanics. Nofre charged reasonable prices and would even offer discount to regular customers. The staff was adept at jury-rigging repairs when proper parts were not available. At least six Sullustans were always present and working at any time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
