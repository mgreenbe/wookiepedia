Tantor's goal was to free Beri Tulon, who was being marched to Tarkin Detention Facility, but Tantor also managed to free a Ruulian Rebel leader who was being escorted along the same route. Several other Ruulian Rebels were in the area, possibly planning a rescue mission of their own; the leader was returned to them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tantor followed up the rescue with an information raid on the Sounder Flats computer complex. Several Ruulian Rebels were in the area, including some with access to stolen AT-ST and AT-PT walkers. Tantor was able to recruit these guerrillas and use them in the raid. Presumably, the Rebellion offered them aid after its success at the Battle of Endor, which occurred shortly after Tantor's mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
