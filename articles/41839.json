Cloned from samples of the original Hutt collected by Luuke Skywalker, a clone of Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, who had died in 9 ABY, Duuurga was created in place of Durga's first clone, Duurga. Thrawn had enjoyed pitting Duurga in arm-wrestles against Chewbaacca, a clone of the Wookiee Chewbacca, which eventually ended in the Hutt having one of his arms pulled out of its socket. After Duuurga was cloned, Thrawn did not let Chewbaaca near him. Like the original Durga, Duuurga was 3.7 meters tall, had no hair and orange eyes. He was a hermaphrodite, as all Hutts are. Duuurga had chose to live with a masculine personality."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Duuurga was mentioned in \"An Apology\", a non-canon short story by Timothy Zahn that was released on April 1, 2012 as an April Fool's Day joke. While the original Durga chose to have a masculine personality during his life, the short story did not specify if Duurga had done the same. In \"An Apology,\" actions taken by characters after they were cloned were performed by clone imposters. Durga was not replaced before his death, and he could not play a role in another Star Wars story afterward; therefore, his clones did not. Duuurga referred to with the present tense in \"An Apology,\" meaning he was still alive when \"An Apology\" was written in 44 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
