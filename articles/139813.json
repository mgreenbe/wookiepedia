In order to free King Lee-Char from imprisonment, Leia Organa and her team planned to kidnap Hubi so they could use his bio-signature to access the King's prison on Strokill Prime. Hubi was mistakenly killed in the crossfire by stormtroopers when he sent them an alert from Lee-Char's cell as the rebels recorded the king's last words to his people. Sometime later, Regent Urtya was informed that Hubi's replacement had yet to be confirmed and that the Imperials were suspicious of rebel activity in the sector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
