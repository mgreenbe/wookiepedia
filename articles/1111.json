It was active during the late Clone Wars after Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order. When she returned to help Republic forces stage an invasion of Mandalore, the company alongside Clone Commander CT-7567 \"Rex\" and Clone Captain CT-0292 \"Vaughn\" were selected to help."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The company reinforced the Republic troops in the invasion, successfully defeating Maul and the Shadow Collective. However, on the way back to Coruscant onboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tribunal, Order 66 was enacted and the 332nd Company attacked Ahsoka Tano and Maul, held prisoner. They were unsuccessful in killing either Force-user, however, and all of the troopers except Rex were killed when the ship crashed on a moon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 332nd Company was an infantry company of clone troopers within the 501st Legion of the Grand Army of the Republic. It was led by Clone Captain CT-7567 \"Rex,\" who was promoted to Clone Commander in order to lead the newly established 332nd Division, which was being created for the Siege of Mandalore. The 332nd Company was part of the division, and shared names. As a company of the Republic, it consisted of four platoons, including a platoon that was present on Ahsoka's return."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The clone troopers of the company were equipped with Phase II clone trooper armor, with the standard blue markings of the 501st. Their helmets, however, were painted red-orange in a stylized version of Ahsoka Tano's facial markings and skin tone\u2014representing their camaraderie to Tano, a former Jedi Commander, and as such they were informally referred to as \"Ahsoka's Clone Troopers.\" There were also some troopers, who hadn't painted their helmets and had their 501st original armor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Throughout the missions and skirmishes that the 332nd Company participated in, they employed the use of infantry weapons, jetpacks, and certain military vehicles, mainly the LAAT/i gunships, which served as their primary method of transportation, and the AT-TE walkers, which were present with the company at times.

After the meeting, Tano met with her former master, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker led her to a hangar, where Captain Rex stood with the company and called them to attention. Tano walked among them in surprise, noting that their helmets were painted in a stylized version of her face.

Captain Rex continued that, although the paint job was crude, it was effective, and they were glad she had returned."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since Tano was no longer a Jedi Commander within the Grand Army of the Republic, and therefore wasn't officially permitted to lead a unit of Republic forces, Captain Rex was promoted from Captain to Commander so that he could lead the new division, which was created with the same designation as the company, and take Tano as an advisor."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Siege of Mandalore"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Initial assault"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Preparing for the siege, three Venator-class Star Destroyers arrived above Mandalore and deployed a large contingent of LAAT carriers and LAAT/i gunships containing infantry forces, including the 332nd Company.

Mandalorian super commando Rook Kast then revealed herself and fired a missile at them, which knocked Tano to the ground. She called after the clones to wait as they ran past her, but Vaughn didn't hear her warning. By the time she reached the clones, they had been ambushed and were all killed, including Vaughn."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mandalorian super commandos then emerged from the tunnels and surrounded Tano, along with Maul.

The 332nd Company split up into squads and hunted the ship. During the search, Ahsoka abducted Rex with the help of onboard astromech droids, knocking the commander out and taking him to the medical bay. She held off hostile clone troopers as Rex's inhibitor chip was surgically removed. After the removal of his chip, Rex was no longer affected by Order 66. He and Tano worked their way to the hangar, fending off troopers of the 332nd along the way."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Maul, who had been released by Tano as a diversion, fought his way to the hyperdrive room, killing many 332nd Company troopers, and collapsed the hyperdrive mid-jump, causing the Venator-class Star Destroyer to fall out of hyperspace in pieces. He then walked over to the hangar, and was confronted by more clone troopers. He used the Force to pick up metal siding to impale or decapitate the clones. A group of 332nd Company troopers, including Ridge, attempted to intercept Maul as he moved towards the hangar, but were unsuccessful.

Rex and Ahsoka came up with a plan, in which Rex brought Ahsoka down to the clone troopers at gunpoint, and claimed that she was no longer a Jedi so they had no reason to kill her. Jesse and Rex argued about the matter for a while, and then Jesse accused Rex of treason."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the debate was a diversion to buy time, and at that moment Tano's group of astromechs dropped the hangar lifts which some of the troopers were standing on. This caught the clones by surprise, but they recovered and opened fire on Tano and Rex. The droids kept changing the elevation of the hangar lifts, to disorient them. By then, the vessel they were all on was about to crash into a nearby moon. Ahsoka and Rex escaped in a Y-wing, and Maul in a Nu-class attack/transport shuttle, but the clones on board were all killed when the ship crashed on the surface of the moon.
