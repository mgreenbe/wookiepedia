In 19 BBY, after the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Jedi Order was hunted and purged. One Baran Do Master, Tokra Hazz, feared that his Order would suffer the same fate. In order to ensure that the Baran Do were not driven to extinction if such an attack occurred, Hazz formed the Hidden Ones with the purpose of preserving the knowledge of the Baran Do Order; therefore, if the Order was ever eradicated, it could be reinstated.

There, the Baran Do became Hidden Ones and chose new names, as they considered their former selves to be dead. The Hidden Ones adopted that practice as, once they entered the caverns, they were never again allowed to leave; otherwise, they would risk exposing the existence of the sect to the galaxy. Such exposure would negate the sect's goal because if the Hidden Ones' existence was known and the Baran Do were attacked, then the Hidden Ones would simply be destroyed as well. However, because the Force thrived on liveliness and vivacity, the Hidden Ones\u2014who were forced to accept death and thus lost their will to live\u2014essentially turned their backs on the Force, causing their powers to wane. The weakening of their powers was also caused by the fact that their sole existence was to retain knowledge; they rarely practiced their skills and never attempted to learn any new ones."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The sect survived undetected by the outside galaxy until 43.5 ABY, when the Jedi Luke and Ben Skywalker embarked on a quest to trace Jedi Knight\u2013turned\u2013Sith Lord Darth Caedus' steps during his five-year journey after the Yuuzhan Vong War, in hopes of learning why he had fallen to the dark side. The Skywalkers infiltrated the Hidden Ones and learned of the many lies that the Hidden Ones' current leader, formerly named Koro Ziil, told his followers\u2014including that the sect was self-sufficient for food and that there was no way to leave the sect's caverns. Hoping to free the sect's members, the Skywalkers began sowing unrest among the Hidden Ones, turning them against their corrupt leader and restoring their will to live. An enraged Ziil confronted the elder Skywalker, but he was defeated, and Ben revealed to the Hidden Ones the many lies that Ziil had kept.

Emperor Palpatine's sudden genocide of the Jedi Order caused several leaders of the Baran Do Sages\u2014a Force-based organization located on the planet Dorin\u2014to become concerned that their Order may suffer the same fate. In order to prevent that, one of the Baran Do Masters, Tokra Hazz, decided to create a secret sect of the Baran Do dedicated to preserving the Order's knowledge so that, should the Baran Do ever be destroyed, the Order could be restored."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hazz traveled deep beneath the surface of Dorin, where he found and expanded a series of caverns, naming them the Caverns of the Hidden One. He established these caverns as the headquarters of the sect, which he named the Hidden Ones, and became their first leader, taking on the title of the Hidden One. Hazz came to the conclusion that if the sect was to remain secret, the Sages who joined could never be allowed to leave the caverns. Therefore, Hazz decided that the sect's members would have to consider themselves dead to the outside galaxy, so that they had no desire to leave the sect. As such, a dying ceremony was established, in which a Sage pretended to die before secretly traveling to the caverns, where they then changed their name and joined the Hidden Ones. Hazz also decided to establish a telepathic technique for communication with the Baran Do on the surface, as a way for reinstating the Baran Do Order if it was ever destroyed."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Discovery and unrest"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hidden Ones grew to include approximately fifty members over the next several decades, with several prominent Baran Do Masters joining their ranks, among them the former Master of the Baran Do Order Koro Ziil, who became the Hidden Ones' leader by 43.5 ABY. Other respected Baran Do who had joined the Hidden Ones by that time included the proficient combatant Ithia and an elderly Baran Do named Burra. In 43.5 ABY, Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker was exiled from Coruscant and the Jedi Order for dereliction of duty. He and his son, Jedi Knight Ben Skywalker, embarked on a quest to retrace the steps that Jedi Knight\u2013turned\u2013Sith Lord Jacen Solo took during his five-year sojourn after the Yuuzhan Vong War, in hopes of discovering more about Solo's fall to the dark side of the Force and transformation into Darth Caedus. Their travels took them to the Baran Do Order on Dorin, where they hoped to find Koro Ziil, who had taught Solo during his travels. The Skywalkers were informed that Ziil had died, but they remained on Dorin anyway and trained with the Baran Do for several days."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During their stay, senior combat instructor Charsae Saal announced that he would be holding his dying ceremony. The Skywalkers attended his ceremony, but Luke wasn't fooled by Saal's apparent death. After searching the area behind the Baran Do temple, the Jedi discovered a secret underground chamber, in which they found Saal alive and well and were allowed to follow him down to the Caverns of the Hidden One. Upon their arrival, the Skywalkers discovered that Ziil had also joined the Hidden Ones and had become the sect's leader."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Skywalkers met with Ziil, who revealed to the Jedi that they would never be allowed to leave the caverns. Saal, meanwhile, took on the name Chara and refused to be addressed by his old name, claiming that just like the Skywalkers, Charsae Saal was dead. Saal gave the Jedi a tour of the Caverns, teaching them the sect's history and confirming that the Caverns had been created so that there was no way for its inhabitants to leave; the only entrance to the Caverns was the 200-kilometer tunnel through which they had come. As one would have to crawl the entire way, it would be impossible for any Kel Dor or Human to carry enough provisions to survive the journey back to the surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Skywalkers began digging out their own chamber that would serve as their private quarters in the Caverns. They spoke again with Ziil, who told the newcomers of his time with Jacen Solo. However, when Ben inquired as to whether or not Ziil would kill the Jedi that would inevitably come searching for the Skywalkers, the discussion turned into a heated argument that ended only when the Hidden One walked away. From the meeting, the Skywalkers deduced that Ziil was paranoid. Still, they lived among the Hidden Ones for several more days, continuing to dig out their chamber and exploring the Caverns. While living among the sect, the Skywalkers found the Hidden Ones to have no sense of purpose; rather, the sect's members were rather bored and lacking in the energy and liveliness that befitted living beings. During that time, Ben discovered that there was a secret trigger in each major chamber of the Caverns that\u2014if driven upward\u2014would activate a signal to detonate the explosive that would collapse the tunnel that led to the Caverns."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During their stay, the Skywalkers attended one of the Hidden Ones' combat training sessions. There, they met a servant named Wyss, who told them of the Hidden Ones' philosophy of only preserving one's old skills, as opposed to acquiring any new ones. During the session, Ben fought with Chara, lasting considerably longer against the Kel Dor than he had when he had taken lessons from him with the Baran Do on the surface. In a series of three matches, Chara also defeated Ithia, a Hidden One who had previously been more talented than Chara in combat before she had joined the sect."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Skywalkers then announced that they would be holding their naming ceremonies. However, once the Hidden Ones had gathered in the Caverns' throne chamber, the Jedi revealed that they had no intention of changing their names; rather, they hoped to rename the Hidden Ones. To Ziil's great displeasure, Luke attempted to show the Hidden Ones that they were wasting away their lives in the caverns by telling them that since the Force thrived on life, energy, and vitality, and the sect's members had turned their back on these things, they had effectively rejected the Force itself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As evidence that the Hidden Ones were weakening, Luke pointed out that Ithia, who had consistently beaten Chara during their time in the Baran Do Order, had just lost three straight matches to him. The elderly Hidden One Burra replied that they had debated the philosophy that Skywalker proposed, but that the Hidden One had decided not to accept it. Ziil attempted to terminate the meeting, but Skywalker continued to say that the Jedi had only survived the Purge because their members and their knowledge were dispersed throughout the galaxy; by concentrating all of their members in one place, the Hidden Ones would be far easier to destroy."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Dissolution"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To further prove his point that the sect's members were weakening, Luke Skywalker proposed a duel between his son and Chara, who was far more experienced and talented than the younger Skywalker. Luke promised that if his son lost, he would abandon his debate. Ziil reluctantly accepted the proposal, and the two combatants were armed with hardwood staffs. Chara quickly gained the upper hand; however, as the duel progressed, the former combat instructor began to lose the will to fight, and Ben eventually defeated him. The Hidden Ones began to feel dissent, although Ziil still refused to accept the Skywalkers' philosophy. Chara admitted that he believed the Skywalkers were right, but Ziil announced that he had commed the Baran Do on the surface, telling them that the Skywalkers had died in an accidental cave-in. As such, he revealed he had discontinued the order of oxygen-nitrogen canisters that were sent down so that the Humans could breathe in the planet's helium-rich atmosphere. Without those canisters, the Jedi would run out of air and die within a few days."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ithia, Burra, and many other Hidden Ones began to protest against their leader's decision, and Ziil, deeply angered by the unrest, attacked the elder Skywalker.

The first was that they were self-sufficient for food; in reality, they had storerooms full of food shipped to them from the surface. The second was that the blast doors that led to the chamber itself had been made on Dorin; in actuality, the metal pieces would have had to have come from another planet, and they would not have been able to fit down the entrance tunnel. Ben then added that the tunnel that he had just collapsed wasn't the only entrance and that the telepathic technique for communicating with the Baran Do on the surface didn't exist\u2014if it did, Ziil wouldn't have needed a comlink to communicate with the Sages."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ziil still refused to expose the Caverns' secrets, but Burra, to Ziil's great dismay, finally revealed his knowledge of the location of the secret exit: a turbolift chamber above the garment storeroom.

The sect's members were allowed to debate and confer with their leader, but ultimately, the Hidden One made every decision for the sect. Still, some of the elder members of the sect and beings who were particularly close to their leader were given access to more knowledge than other members of the Hidden Ones\u2014such as the existence of the secret turbolift exit.

As such, the sect's members were forced to resign themselves to the fact that they would never again be allowed to leave the caverns, because, if they did, the sect would risk being discovered by the outside galaxy. That induced the creation of the dying ceremony, which allowed sect members to resign themselves to their deaths by making the outside galaxy believe they were actually dead. These traditions permitted the Hidden Ones to think of themselves as having already died, and upon their arrival in the Caverns of the Hidden One, they took on a new name, refusing to go by their original name\u2014the name of a dead being."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hidden Ones' outlook on preserving knowledge was strictly traditional\u2014they did not believe in frequently practicing their Force techniques or acquiring new powers; rather, they simply existed to remember the skills that they already knew. The Hidden Ones believed that goal to be just and noble and they took pride in the task, but\u2014due to their acceptance of death and consequential lack of liveliness\u2014they went about their duties with great gravity. The Skywalkers found the sect's members to be exceptionally somber. The lack of energy and audacity had a profoundly adverse effect on the Hidden Ones' skills in their ability to utilize the Force. By accepting death, the Hidden Ones lost their will to live and to keep fighting, essentially turning their backs on the vitality and life that was the Force itself. Therefore, their ability to control the Force weakened, and their powers and skills deteriorated over time as a result."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some of the sect's members realized these shortcomings, and at some point, the Hidden Ones debated on their philosophy.
