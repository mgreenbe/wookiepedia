The name of the system built upon the mention of the location Zrak in the 1993 book Monsters and Aliens from George Lucas, a publication that combines creature designs and photographs from various projects of George Lucas, creator of the Star Wars franchise, with original text by Bob Carrau. In the book, Zrak is given as the origin point of a male Heep-heep who at some point became stuck in a crack. Lucasfilm employee Leland Chee, who maintains the Holocron continuity database, has indicated that information contained in Monsters and Aliens from George Lucas is non-canonical with respect to the Star Wars Legends continuity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
