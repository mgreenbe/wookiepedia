It contained the supertanker fuel depot's hyperdrive, mounted directly above the central control table. The room also contained controls for all of the Colossus' systems, including doors, power systems, and atmospheric controls. By the time the Colossus was occupied by the First Order in 34 ABY, the hyperdrive chamber had been out of use for many years."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Colossus' hyperdrive chamber first appeared in the Star Wars Resistance season 1 episode \"No Escape: Part 1\".
