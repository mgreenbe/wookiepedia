Although it was commonly awarded to combat Alliance pilots, the medal was not a specific combat medal. The Distinguished Flying Medal could be awarded to pilots or crews who ran blockades, by rebel smugglers, or by another other pilot who went above and beyond their call of duty while flying for the Alliance to Restore the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The medal was characterized by a round, silver alloy medallion that portrayed a stylized ion turbine that was suspended from a broad, rectangular red ribbon with a broad central silver stripe flanked by two thin blue stripes.
