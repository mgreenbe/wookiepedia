During her training she was a part of the all-female Unit Forn along with three other cadets; however, after failing twice to achieve objectives during a combat training exercise she was dismissed from the academy. Commandant Cumberlayne Aresko later inquired what had become of Illorus, and was informed of her dismissal by Sergeant Currahee, after which her place in Forn was filled by a student transferred from one of Lothal's other academies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Illorus was first mentioned in Servants of the Empire: Rebel in the Ranks, a novel by Jason Fry which was published in 2015.
