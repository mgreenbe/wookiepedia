While the journey from Coruscant to Aviles Prime was uneventful, the industrialist's Republic Cruiser reported a life support system failure during the return trip. They decided to drop out of hyperspace by the nearest world, the abandoned moon of Asturias, in order to repair. As they did so, all hell broke loose: a droid control ship appeared out of nowhere and attacked the convoy. Both Oviedo's cruiser and the commandos' escort ship were damaged and had to crash land on Asturias."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Only seven commandos out of the escort ship's eighteen-man crew survived.

In the end, only RC sergeant Theta twenty-eight-eight and Lorca Oviedo managed to reach Coruscant alive. The commandos had fulfilled their mission. Unfortunately, the traitorous industrialist died of asphyxia while in custody, before he could reveal anything to the Republic. The exact cause of death remained unknown..."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Satisfied with the report, Mace Windu dismissed the sergeant and assured him that his men's sacrifice would not go unnoticed.
