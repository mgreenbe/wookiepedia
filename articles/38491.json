It interferred with medical sensor readings, specifically blocking the scanner from detecting any traces of the neurotoxin h'gartha. Anyone reading the sensor readings would determine that an individual who died of h'gartha poisoning actually died of natural causes. The generator had to be within one meter of the scanner to work."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
