In 5 ABY, he saw action during the Battle of Nag Ubdur as part of the New Republic Thirty-First. He and his unit fought entrenched Imperial forces at Govneh Ridge, a plate shift where the ground bulged and was covered with tall crystals. During the fighting, Khadur's squad leader Hachinka was shot in the neck by a blaster. Khadur was splattered with blood from the blaster bolt. He and his comrades managed to evacuate her from the battle.
