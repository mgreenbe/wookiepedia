The Ewok shaman Logray owned a globe of Endor that depicted the Lightning Forest as a cluster of trees that crackled with electricity. In 3 ABY, the young Ewoks Wicket Wystri Warrick, Latara, Teebo, and Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka used Logray's globe to search for a place to send Norky, a troublesome child who was staying in their village. Looking at the globe, Latara suggested sending Norky to the Lightning Forest, claiming that he would be \"burned to a crisp.\" Teebo alternatively suggested the Molten Mountains. Finally, Kintaka suggested the Vacant Valley, reminding the group that they were just trying to relocate Norky, not bring him physical harm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lightning Forest first appeared in \"Bringing Up Norky,\" the nineteenth episode in the second season of the animated television series Ewoks.
