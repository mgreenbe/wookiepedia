In 32 BBY, Naboo was invaded by the Trade Federation and its Droid Army. Shortly after the company's landing, three troopers of Force Command Two fought two B1-Series battle droids and stole one of five droid control programs that had been sent to Naboo to keep the Federation army active. The program was taken to a research station near the city Harte Secur, where it was used to deactivate a portion of the Droid Army commanded by the battle droid OOM-14. Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray ordered the droid OOM-9 to recover the program, an objective he soon completed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Naboo theft of the droid control program was first mentioned in the Prima Games strategy guide for the 2001 LucasArts video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds.
