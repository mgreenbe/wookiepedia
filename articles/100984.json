It was used to fix starships and serve as drydocks for starships off mission. After the Battle of Endor the Imperial Fleet attempted to use these satellites so they could repair and regroup at the Imperial shipyards at Kuat but were thrown off by the pursuing Rebel Fleet and the invading Zann Consortium Fleet which ignited the Battle for the Eclipse. Mon Calamari Shipyards used these for the Alliance Fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
