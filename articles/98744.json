While he is not wearing it, a group of bounty hunters attempt to kill him. Dressed only in a robe, he tricks some of the hunters into killing each other. He kills another barehanded and steals the dead being's blade. The ringleader of the hunters steals Fett's Mandalorian armor and Slave I. Using the ship's cannons, he blasts the facility that Fett is in. Believing he killed Fett, he goes to a nearby cantina, impersonating him. Fett comes in wearing Jango's old armor and takes his armor back, but leaves the impersonator alive to remember who is number one."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
