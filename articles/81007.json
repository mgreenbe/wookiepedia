The name Lela Mayn is an anagram of \"Amy Allen.\" It was initially unknown whether Lela was the third Nalle triplet, but the appearance of one of the sisters in Evasive Action: Recruitment being very much like her costume in Attack of the Clones strongly suggested it. Lela Mayn's entry in StarWars.com's original Databank later confirmed that she was the third triplet, with Mayn being her married name."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
