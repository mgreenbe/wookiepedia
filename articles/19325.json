The Galactic Republic developed an antidote on the planet Tauber and began shipping it through the planet Kabal. The shipments, however, never reached their destination, as the transports carrying them were attacked by the Fujari pirates, who ruined six million doses. The Republic took no action against the Fujari, and millions of Bordali died until the neighboring Rseikharhl eventually began manufacturing the antidote for the Bordali."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bordal was part of the Galactic Republic and, later, the Galactic Empire.
