Prior to the reign of Emperor Palpatine, Dibs held the rank of Jedi Master during his time in the Jedi Order. During the Clone Wars, Dibs was sent on a operation on Hissrich where his faith in the Jedi's role as peacekeepers conflicted with their new responsibilities as generals in the armed forces of the Galactic Republic. After returning to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant from Hissrich, Dibs was put on trial by Grand Master Yoda and the Jedi High Council for attempting to kill Mace Windu. At Windu's request, Dibs was spared from the death penalty and sentenced to rehabilitation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the aftermath of the Great Jedi Purge, Dibs joined the ranks of the Inquisitorius\u2014a group of Jedi hunters led by Darth Vader, Sith Lord and the Emperor's apprentice\u2014as the \"Tenth Brother.\" He accompanied Vader, the Ninth Sister, and the Sixth Brother to the planet Mon Cala to hunt Padawan Ferren Barr, a survivor of the Purge. Although the Inquisitorius renounced their allegiance to the Jedi Order, Barr manipulated the Purge Troopers into executing Order 66 against the fallen Jedi, including the Tenth Brother who was shot to death by the clones in the ensuing firefight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Assignment to Hissrich"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the First Battle of Geonosis, the Jedi High Council sought to ascertain the truth behind the Separatist operation on the planet Hissrich. While assembling a special squad for this assignment, Prosset Dibs was chosen by Mace Windu, who felt that Dibs possessed a strong intuition in spite of his blindness. Windu also chose Jedi Master Kit Fisto and Jedi Knight Rissa Mano to be on his team. He believed that Dibs would provide useful insight and reconnaissance for the mission."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After arriving on Hissrich via the T-6 shuttle Westwind, Dibs confided in Windu his feeling of unease in the Force as well as his belief that the teachings and beliefs of the Jedi Order were being tested, to which Windu concurred. Around the same time they noticed a group of battle droids patrolling the area. Windu told Fisto and Dibs to go above and around and told Mano to go with him. They almost immediately charged the droids and Dibs jumped on top of an Octuptarra tri-droid, cutting it in half. A B2-series super battle droid then attempted to catch him off guard and kill him. Fisto took him from behind and cut it down. Dibs thanked Fisto and the Jedi were suddenly confronted by the planet's inhabitants."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dibs and the rest of the squad were led by the inhabitants into series of caverns hidden beneath Hissrich's surface, which led him to the native's home. Dibs and the others believed that the natives had brought them there for a reason. He also believed that the inhabitants had a clue about the Separatists' plans for Hissrich. As the Separatists drilled into the planet, their forces invaded the caverns in which the Jedi were in. Windu told the other to defend the natives while he handled the destroyers. Their mercenary commander AD-W4 then engaged Windu and when the other Jedi joined, the Separatist Harvester droids intervened splitting Windu and Mano from the other two the squad. Dibs continued to fight alongside Fisto to protect the inhabitants."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dibs and Fisto ended up finding themselves in the darkness of the cave and used their lightsabers to light the place up. Dibs insisted to Fisto that they tend to the wounded inhabitants, to which he agreed. However, they sensed danger nearby and the two were confronted by a Milodon. Dibs cut through its side with his lightsaber and Fisto joined immediately. The two continued digging their lightsabers into the creature until it fell to the ground. After killing the creature, they found the remains of several deceased indigenous inhabitants. Alarmed by the numbers of deaths on Hissrich, Dibs began to question the Jedi's ability to maintain peace and protect others, to which Fisto countered by stating that casualties are inevitable in war and that the Jedi were now striving to mitigate the loss of life. Dibs, however, was not convinced."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Betraying Windu"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After reuniting with Windu and Mano, Dibs confronted Windu by voicing his disagreement with the Jedi's role in the Clone Wars. He made several accusations against both Windu and the Council, ranging from callousness towards collateral damage to corrupting the Jedi doctrine, and proceeded to physically assault Windu, who refused to entertain Dibs' claims, dismissing all of them as \"bold accusations\" and \"grand inquisitions.\" Dibs then ignited his lightsaber, intending to take Windu's life. Though he felt responsible for failing Dibs, Windu activated his own lightsaber in order to defend himself, resulting in a duel between the two Jedi Masters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As they fought, Windu beseeched Dibs to cease his attack by reminding him that they were essentially brothers in the sense that they were both chosen to walk the path of the Jedi. Dibs rejected all of Windu's words as lies and declared his intent to no longer serve the Jedi Order and follow his own path. The duel pressed on until Windu Force-pushed Dibs to the ground and deprived him of his lightsaber. After a moment of contemplation, Windu decided that the Jedi Council should determine Dibs' fate and therefore arrested him.

He refused to find fault in his actions and again expressed his belief that the Council was twisting the Jedi doctrine for their own selfish gain. Ultimately, he was found guilty of treason, and though Dibs expected to be put to death, Windu, who harbored his own reservations against the Jedi's new military responsibilities, implored his colleagues to be merciful."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He believed that the Jedi had a duty to help rehabilitate the members of the Order who strayed from the light, and therefore requested for Dibs to be placed on probation, confined to work in the Jedi Archives, where he hoped the fallen Jedi would reevaluate his opinions. Dibs, however, remained skeptical of Windu's sincerity and as his former friend walked out of the chamber, taunted him that his hubris would be his undoing. Windu later confided in Mano his concern for Dibs and the future of the Jedi Order, but the experience ultimately renewed his faith in the Jedi's role as the protectors of all peoples across the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Fall to the Dark Side"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 BBY, the Jedi Order was all but wiped out by Order 66, a contingency order implanted into the clone troopers that ordered the deaths of all Jedi.

Alongside Tenth Brother were Sixth Brother, Ninth Sister and a squad of elite clones known as Purge Troopers. They traveled to Dac City where negotiations between Ambassador Telvar and King Lee-Char were becoming hopeless. Upon arrival, the three Inquisitors were stopped by the King's chief of Security, Gial Ackbar, at the landing pad. The Mon Calamari demanded their business and Vader came down to explain the possible presence of a Jedi on their planet. Ackbar refused the possibility at first but as Telvar departed Dac City, his Lambda-class T-4a shuttle exploded, killing all on board. Vader and the Inquisitors passed Ackbar and traveled into the city."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Telvar's superior, Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, responded to the assassination by sending his forces down to Mon Cala. Led by Major Rantu, the Imperial forces invaded Dac City with Vader and the Inquisitors fighting to take the landing pad. After taking the landing pad, the Ninth Sister asked Vader where they were to go. Vader told her they were going to the palace to question the king about the Jedi. The tenth Brother then questioned Vader as to why the Jedi would even stay in the palace after Tarkin's forces came down and Vader told him that the king remained there. The four fought their way into the palace where Ninth Sister interrogated the king. However the king had already ordered the final defensive maneuver and a school of giant fish-like creatures broke through the sea-level and caused a tsunami to erupt throughout the planet's surface.

They found Vader alive and picked him up. Ninth Sister revealed she had found the location of the Jedi they were looking for from her interrogation with Lee-Char and they set a course for it in search of their target. There they found Jedi Padawan Ferren Barr and his six disciples evacuating their refuge.

Another, Orvek, sacrificed himself to slow them down a bit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The four continued to pursue Barr and his disciples to Bel City where another two, Stell and Rebb, stayed behind to slow them down.

Barr then confronted them and reminded them about their Jedi past, reciting their original names including Tenth Brother's. Barr claimed they will always be a Jedi to which Ninth Sister refused his claim. But Barr wasn't trying to tell it to them, but to the Purge troopers, as they were clones. Before the Inquisitors could realize this, Barr used a mind trick on the troopers saying \"execute Order 66\". The Purge troopers then turned to the Inquisitors and despite Tenth Brother's protests to them, they opened fire. The three Inquisitors began blocking the shots and deflecting them back at the manipulated troopers, but there were too many to deflect and the Tenth Brother was hit in the chest, dropping him to the floor, dead."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Post-death"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Immediately after the Tenth Brother's death, Barr and Verla Force Jumped over the fighting and escaped.

Dibs himself admitted that he had a great mind, and believed his only flaw was his tendency to \"speak about it.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dibs was a firm believer in the Jedi's role as peacekeepers, and thus disagreed with their new responsibilities as warriors and military leaders in the Clone Wars. During a mission on Hissrich, his doubts about their new role and the loss of multiple natives, which he felt the Jedi were responsible for and should never have happened in the first place, led him to lose faith in the Order and the High Council. Eventually, his disillusionment turned to anger, and he came to believe that the Jedi had not only abandoned their traditions but were distorting them for their own selfish gain.

He became a part of the Inquisitorius, where he adopted his name, and was willing to hunt down and kill the Jedi he once respected and fought alongside. The Tenth Brother was observant and assumed that Lee-Char would have left Dac City when Tarkin sent his forces down to Mon Cala. Vader put his mind to rest when he told him that Lee-Char remained at the palace. The Tenth Brother was more callous than his former self and openly insulted Mon Cala as smelling like fish upon his arrival. When the Ninth Sister told him it was just Sixth Brother, he pushed his ego by saying it was more like fish. When the Purge troopers were convinced to turn on the Tenth Brother and the other two, by Barr, he called them \"stupid clones\", even though he was trying to keep them on his side.

He wore brown Jedi robes and had a black blindfold to cover his empty eye sockets. He also had a black belt around his waist and wore brown boots. Furthermore, he wore beige trousers and had his long hair tied back with a bandanna. When part of the Inquisitorius, the Tenth Brother kept his eye sockets open and exposed rather than covered up. Unlike his fellow Inquisitors he did not wear armor, save for a pair of shoulder-mounted epaulettes in black with the Imperial crest on them and a pair of black bracers on his forearms, instead opting for a grey robe-like ensemble and cloth wrappings up the length of his arms to a point just above his bicep as well as wrapped around the lower half of his face like a mask. This provided little protection from blasterfire, as was shown when he was shot and killed quite easily.
