By 0 ABY, Thoad claimed to be Centares' largest dealer in used spacecraft, and often referred customers to a cousin who dealt droids in Centares' Old Town. That year, Thoad made a rather lucrative trade when he met two Rebel leaders, Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, who were looking to offload a flashy yacht while evading the Empire. Thoad took the yacht in exchange for a less-expensive scout craft, which carried with it a much lower profile. A passing remark Thoad made during the exchange turned the Rebels' attention to an Imperial blockade of the Rebel-held Yavin system, sending them scurrying back to their base on Yavin 4."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jorman Thoad made his first appearance in Star Wars 25, written by Archie Goodwin and released in 1979.
