When Jabba decided to execute the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker and the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca by feeding them to the sarlacc as Skywalker killed his pet rancor Pateesa, Tezeri was assigned as one of the guards who accompanied the prisoners on a skiff to the Great Pit of Carkoon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, during the execution attempt, thanks to R2-D2, Skywalker managed to break free and attacked the guards on his skiff.

With such bad luck, Tezeri fell to the sand and rolled until falling into the mouth of the Sarlacc, to slowly be digested over thousands of years."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Velken Tezeri was played by stuntman Larry Holt in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
