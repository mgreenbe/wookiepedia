His skin was yellowish-green and he had red eyes. He once managed to steal a lightsaber from Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano's belt. However, he decided to get rid of the lightsaber after his fiddling around with it injured his left arm- or as he put it \"almost killed himself. He eventually sold it to the Trandoshan Nack Movers. Soon, Tano, with the help of Jedi Master Tera Sinube, tracked Bannamu down to his hideout in the Spider Arms Hostel and interrogated him about the whereabouts of her weapon. When he retorted that he thought she was too young to be a Jedi, she flung him against the wall with the Force. He revealed that he had sold her lightsaber to Nack Movers and revealed that Movers lived with his girlfriend in an apartment on the upper-east corner of Happyland."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In his first appearance, he is voiced by James Arnold Taylor; he speaks with a slight Italian accent."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
