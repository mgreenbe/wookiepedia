They were often hunted and eaten by Kitonak. The Kitonak would mimic the creature's favorite dish, the sulfaro plant. They would lie down and wait for a chooba to climb up to its head looking for the real plant's meaty interior. The Kitonak would then swallow the slug whole. One chooba could last a Kitonak a full month."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
