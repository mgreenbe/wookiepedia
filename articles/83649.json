Supreme Chancellor Palpatine formed the Committee as an advisory body to himself to handle the Separatist Crisis, cleanse the Senate of corruption (especially Separatist sympathies), and promote loyalty to the Galactic Republic. The original membership comprised 10 Senators:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The committee was often a target of criticism prior to the Battle of Geonosis, with claims of being a \"Shadow government\" and an attempt by Palpatine to prevent the passing of the Military Creation Act. The Committee itself was split between pro-military and pro-diplomacy. One member, Orn Free Taa, was a strong Militarist during the Separatist Crisis, but he approved of the attempt by Palpatine to negotiate with the Separatists. Prior to the Battle of Geonosis, Havriso Looruya was exposed as having Separatist ties by Onaconda Farr (Savareen sector), who replaced him on the Committee; also, upon the assassination of Aks Moe, Moe was replaced by Ask Aak (Malastare)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the wake of the Battle of Duro, both Onaconda Farr and Ronet Coorr were forced to step down in disgrace, and Lexi Dio was assassinated and replaced on the Committee by Mal\u00e9-Dee (Uyter)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The membership of the Committee changed during the Clone Wars, and towards the end of the war included such Senators as Mon Mothma (Chandrila), Fang Zar (Sern Prime/Legends), Bana Breemu (Humbarine), Chi Eekway Papanoida (Wroona)and Terr Taneel (Senex sector)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Interestingly, most members of the Loyalist Committee were vocal opponents of Palpatine's reformations, suggesting the Committee may really have been a means for Palpatine to keep an eye on potential enemies. The Committee found itself increasingly at odds with the Chancellor's increasing executive powers, and often had trouble gaining an audience with him. Many of the Committee members were amongst the Delegation of 2000, with Amidala as their spokesman, seeking to persuade the Chancellor to surrender his emergency powers and return power to the Senate: the Delegation especially opposed the creation of the office of Moff, which effectively stripped the Senate of real power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Clone Wars ended and the New Order was declared, at least two of the Loyalist Committee members, Organa and Mothma, went on to become leaders of the Alliance to Restore the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
