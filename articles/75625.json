After a failed attempt at infiltrating the facility, Keth-Keth suggested that they smash a speeder into the building, but the team rejected his proposal, believing it to be irrational and illegal. However, Roorrwiir accidentally crashed the team's speeder into the building, and Keth-Keth and the others quickly made their way through the building and rescued their friend. However, while they were attempting to leave, an Office of Peace and Security speeder arrived, and Keth-Keth threw a stun grenade at it. Believing that they needed someone to blame the incident on, Keth-Keth used spray-namel to write the words \"W.O.L.F.\" on the OPS speeder, and he ran around shouting the phrases \"Free Kashyyyk\" and \"Wookiee Liberation Front\". The incident gained the supposed \"Wookiee Liberation Front\" a lot of publicity and it eventually developed into a real organization, assisting the Wookiees of Kashyyyk."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point after the incident, Keth-Keth and Meelo were stopped by some clone troopers in the city Hedrett, for an I.D. check.
