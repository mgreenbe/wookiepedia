In 23 ABY, Hapan Queen Mother Ta'a Chume and Jedi trainees Tenel Ka, Lowbacca, Jacen Solo, and Jaina Solo, along with Lobacca's translator droid M-TD, were in a boat being chased by Bartokk assassins who were hired to kill Ta'a Chume. Jaina, who was piloting the craft, decided to try to make the assassins crash by leading them into the Dragon's Teeth. Although the assassins did not crash, their craft did sustain some damage and three Bartokks fell out of it. The remaining Bartokks were eventually killed by some carnivorous seaweed which Jaina lured them into."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Dragon's Teeth first appeared in Young Jedi Knights: Lightsabers, a young reader's novel written by Kevin J.
