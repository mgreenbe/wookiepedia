It stayed successfully competitive in the galactic speeder market by identifying and exploiting the niche of those with a dream of competing in speeder racing, of which Dak himself was a fanatic fan. The company did this by producing speeders like the Joben T-85 speeder bike, which became popular in the Outer Rim Territories, which had shorter runs then the speeders produced by larger companies and appealed to racing fans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
