At some point, he managed to capture and imprison some of the pirates in his basement, after which he left his home to locate an Imperial garrison to have them arrested. He left his wife, Helen, to guard the pirates. While he was away, a spacer, on a quest to become the Hero of Tatooine, visited his home. Helen asked her guest if they would watch the prisoners while she took a break, to which the spacer agreed. During this time, the pirates tried to persuade the spacer to free them, but they refused and proceeded to tell Helen of their plans to escape. At that same moment, Roric had finally arrived back with two Imperial dark troopers following. The troopers promptly arrested the pirates and Roric thanked the anonymous spacer for protecting both his home and his wife."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Roric is a non-playable character who appears in the 2003 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided.
