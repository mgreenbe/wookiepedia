Designed by Systech Corporation weapons manufacturing company, it was an awkward weapon, which was difficult to wield without special training. Shaped like a pistol with auxiliary sonic emitters attached to either side of the barrel, the aural blaster could deafen a target with a successful hit. Though inferior in damage potential to traditional blasters, the blaster's design made it a viable weapon, with its deafening and disorientating capabilities. This weapon dealt a type of damage called sonic damage which meant it could not be deflected by a lightsaber as a normal blaster bolt could."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was said that Loppak Slusk, an Exchange boss on Telos IV during the First Jedi Purge, was known to have wielded this type of blaster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This blaster's name is misspelled as \"Aurial blaster\" in the Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
