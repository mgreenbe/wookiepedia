While preparing to hold some Jedi Trials for students of the Almas Academy, the Jedi Master Lanius Qel-Bertuk dispatched a group of Jedi members of the Heroes of Cularin to collect some lightsaber components from Snem Noonb, a Sullustan who operated a manufacturing facility on Edic Bar. As a test for the agents, Qel-Bertuk conspired with Noonb to organize a \"Test of the Droids\", whereby Noonb would program a number of droids to stage a mock droid revolt after the heroes arrived. However, an agent of the Genarius-based criminal Zelice Sturm secretly re-programmed the droids to stage a genuine uprising that was beyond the control of Noonb. The heroes successfully defeated the droids, and Noonb contacted Qel-Bertuk, to inform him that the droids had been tampered with."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Test of the Droids was created by Ronald A.
