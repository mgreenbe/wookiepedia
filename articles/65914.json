At least five of the speeders participated in a battle against a group of Rebels attacking Weapons Factory Alpha, an Imperial facility on the moon Cymoon 1. The speeders attacked an All Terrain Armored Transport piloted by the rebels Han Solo and Leia Organa during the attack alongside a number of All Terrain Scout Transports and assault tanks. The Sith Lord Darth Vader commandeered a combat speeder piloted by a stormtrooper in order to try and chase down the Rebel Luke Skywalker before he destroyed the factory. Vader was unsuccessful in catching Skywalker, who was driving a 74-Z speeder bike and managed to shoot the factory's reactor and cause it to overheat and explode."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The combat speeders first appeared in Star Wars 3, a comic book released in 2015 which was written by Jason Aaron and illustrated by John Cassaday."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
