She founded the Order after learning of Revan during her time on Korriban as a Sith acolyte. She learned of Revan's visit to Dromund Kaas three centuries prior to the Cold War, and believed that he had overthrown the Sith Emperor and sat in his throne."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She lived within the Revanite compound on the Sith Empire's capital planet of Dromund Kaas. Initiates who completed their Pilgrimage were granted an audience with \"her\" in the form of a hologram of a man dressed as Revan.

Revan, impressed with Darkspanner and all she had accomplished with the Order of Revan, offered her the opportunity to expand the order's roster and purpose. Granted the title of Lord Darkspanner, she served as one of Revan's most trusted commanders until her death on Yavin 4 by joint champions of the Empire and Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tari Darkspanner is a character from the 2011 Star Wars: The Old Republic MMORPG video game.

The player(s) can either go along with Darkspanner's plan, setting Sandor against Charnus (light side dialogue); or identify Darkspanner to Sandor, allowing the Dark Council to capture her (dark side dialogue). Given that Charnus later appears during the Battle of Corellia, and Darkspanner later re-emerges on Yavin 4, both efforts would not achieve their intended aim."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
