Members of practically all galactic species collaborated directly or indirectly in the fight for freedom. Whether it was taking an active part in both organizations or waging a particular war on their own, all those aliens played a crucial role in the confrontation against the Galactic Empire and the First Order. And there is no better example than the mighty Chewbacca, Han Solo's inseparable friend. Throughout his long life, the Wookiee carried out all kinds of jobs, from warrior to smuggler at the controls of the Millennium Falcon, but went down to posterity for his momentous help to the Rebellion during the Galactic Civil War, and also its successor ideological, the Resistance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
