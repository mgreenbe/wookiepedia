With knowledge about antique artifacts, she saved her fellow Rogues from embarrassing bargains many a time. She was also very capable with hand-to-hand combat.

Continuing to fly with the Rogues, she went with them to investigate the disappearance of Syal Antilles Fel and then to investigate pirate activity on Axxila.
