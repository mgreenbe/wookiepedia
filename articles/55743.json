According to myth, when Ambassador Slokin, who worked under Gorson, met with his superior, the protocol droid was sent to provide refreshments. Slokin, plotting to kill Gorson and take his power, took the drinks from the droid, slipping poison into Gorson's glass. After Gorson succumbed to the poison, Slokin departed, informing the droid that Gorson felt unwell and wished to remain undisturbed for some time. Gorson's body was eventually discovered, with his death ruled as a heart attack, and Slokin was granted his former superior's position."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
