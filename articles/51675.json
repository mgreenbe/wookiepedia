As senator, Atanna was provided with the Esprix Estate, the official residence of Esseles' senator. In 19 BBY, the Republic was reformed into the Galactic Empire following the conclusion of the Clone Wars, and Atanna continued to represent Esseles in the new Imperial Senate. In 0 BBY, Emperor Palpatine dissolved the Imperial Senate, handing control of the Imperial bureaucracy to the regional Imperial governors. Atanna's responsibility for Esseles was taken over by Moff Jander Graffe, who set about replacing the bureaucracy that Atanna had built."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Atanna and his wife retired to a suburb in the city of Calamar on Esseles, where the former senator kept a low profile, avoiding attention from the Empire and local political parties. During this time, he worked as a spy for the Alliance to Restore the Republic, secretly passing on information regarding defense industry programs on Esseles. While on an off-world business trip during the Galactic Civil War, Atanna was compromised and arrested by the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An Alliance extraction team was dispatched to rescue Atanna from Imperial incarceration, while a second team headed to Esseles, where his wife and grandchildren were being held under house arrest at the former senator's estate. The team successfully rescued the family, neutralizing around fifteen guards and several security devices to do so. Smuggling them off-world was harder, as Esseles Governor Griff Takel had ordered all starships leaving the planet to be thoroughly searched due to Moff Graffe's indication that he would be very displeased if Atanna's family escaped. However, the Alliance team was able to exfiltrate the planet and take Atanna's family to a secret rendezvous point, where they were to be transferred to an Alliance safe world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gabrial Atanna was a competent senator, serving in the position as Esseles' representative for two governments.
