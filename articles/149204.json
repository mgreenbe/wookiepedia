The charges came after she visited with Letta Turmond, who was being held as a suspect in the case, and Turmond was Force choked to death while Tano was in her cell."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tano was then imprisoned, but escaped. However, she was eventually caught and brought to the trial, but not before being cast out of the Jedi Order and stripped of her Padawan braid. She was represented by Padm\u00e9 Amidala, who sought desperately to find a way to clear her client, but with little success."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ultimately, Tano was cleared of the charges because the Jedi Knight who was her master, Anakin Skywalker, conducted his own investigation and discovered that the crime Tano had been accused of had in fact been committed by Barriss Offee, a Jedi Padawan who had grown disillusioned with the behavior of the Jedi Order during the Clone Wars. Afterwards, Tano was invited to rejoin the Jedi Order, but refused, stating that she had to follow her own path."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, Padawan Barriss Offee\u2014believing the Jedi Order and Galactic Republic had lost their way\u2014orchestrated a terrorist attack against the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, killing several Jedi, clone troopers, and civilians. She then framed her friend and fellow Jedi Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, for the bombing of the temple hangar, as well as the murder of Offee's co-conspirator, Letta Turmond."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Desperate to clear her name, Tano fled to the Coruscant Underworld and ultimately enlisted the aid of the former Separatist assassin Asajj Ventress. She also contacted Offee for help, which Offee used to lure Tano into a trap. As a result, Tano was captured by Republic clone troopers and\u2014at the request of the Galactic Senate\u2014subsequently expelled from the ranks of the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The trial"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The trial of Ahsoka Tano was held in the massive Court Chamber of the Republic Center for Military Operations. Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine presided over the proceedings, flanked by his red-robed guards. A manacled Tano was escorted to a floating platform where she was then moved to the center of the hall. On either side, senators, who were serving as the jury, were seated in rows of ten or twelve. The Jedi High Council, observing the trial, sat in another row above the senators."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the left side of Tano, the prosecution was situated, with the lead prosecutor being Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin. On the right side was the defense, represented by Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala. Palpatine, as judge of the court, spoke first, relaying the charges against Tano and stating that the court would decide her fate. He then told Tarkin to begin his arguments, to which Tarkin vowed to prove that Tano was guilty not only of the bombing, but eliminating her co-conspirators one-by-one. He also asked the court that the full extent of the law be brought down upon Tano, including the death penalty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amidala made an impassioned plea in Tano's defense, revealing to the court that Turmond had called a meeting with Tano to reveal the identity of the true mastermind behind the bombing, but was strangled to death by way of the Force before she could do so. She asked why Tano would kill Turmond in a manner that would so easily implicate her. However, Tarkin was unimpressed and pointed out that Tano had been seen in the company of Asajj Ventress, a known Separatist terrorist. Tano protested that Ventress had framed her, but her protests rang hollow. Eventually, the closing arguments settled. Palpatine told the jury he was sure that many of them did not believe Tano was the culprit, but reminded them of all the times they had been fooled by the Separatists and suggested that Tano was yet another scheme to rip the Jedi and the Republic apart."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker\u2014Tano's former master who still believed her to be innocent\u2014had conducted his own investigation which led him to Offee. After a lengthy duel with the treacherous Padawan, Skywalker and the Jedi Temple Guards overpowered and captured her. Back in the court room, Senator Mot-Not Rab announced that the jury had reached a decision. However, just as Palpatine was about to read the verdict, Skywalker burst in with Offee. Tano was shocked to learn that her friend had been setting her up. Offee finally admitted her guilt, but remained adamant in her belief that the Jedi and the Republic had lost their way. Palpatine then ordered that Offee be taken away, and all charges against Tano were dropped."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Afterwards, Tano was released by the Republic and returned to the Jedi Temple, where she was personally pardoned by the Jedi Council. Plo Koon offered Tano their most humble apologies for accusing her of treachery. Ki-Adi-Mundi, Saesee Tiin and Mace Windu all observed Tano's ordeal as a great trial in her training, which they stated had made her a greater Jedi than she would've been otherwise. They invited her to rejoin the Jedi Order, but to everyone's shock, Tano refused and left. Skywalker followed her and begged her to reconsider, noting that the idea of leaving the Order was something he himself struggled with. Tano replied that she knew, but still chose to walk away, stating that she had to follow her own path."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
