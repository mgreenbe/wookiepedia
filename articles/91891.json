It employed an Astromech droid to assist with in-flight operations and navigation. The Miy'til was, like other small starfighters, relatively lightly armed, with only two laser cannons and one concussion missile launcher. A command version of the starfighter was more expensive, but equipped with another laser cannon, two ion cannons, and another missile launcher."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Each Nova-class battle cruiser carried 24 Miy'til starfighters, while 36 were carried aboard a Hapan Battle Dragon.

Interestingly, they served alongside X-wings in the Hapan fleet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prince Isolder had a modified version of this fighter, the Storm, which included a turbo booster engine similar in design to the SLAM system that was used on Imperial Missile Boats, allowing it to briefly attain speeds roughly 33% faster than the notably fast RZ-1 A-wing interceptor. The Storm was also much more heavily armed, mounting three laser cannons, two ion cannons, a concussion missile launcher, and two thermal detonator bombing tubes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These fighters continued to be in use as of the Hapan Insurrection, participating on both sides of the engagement.
