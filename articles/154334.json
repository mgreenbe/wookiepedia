During his term as Prefect, he was assassinated, leading to a new government and new protocols. The Prefect's assassination did not cause much uproar within the Scofti due to the common violent nature of their governmental transitions. Following the new government's appointment, numerous nearby societies sent diplomats to Bardram Scoft, including the Chiss Ascendancy. Upon hearing the news from Junior Commander Thrawn, the Pathfinder navigator Qilori, who guided the starship carrying the Chiss ambassador to Bardram Scoft, was shocked by the Prefect's death and the lack of distress among the Scofti."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
