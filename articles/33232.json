Prior to the Techno Union's experiments on the planet, daggerflies were among the many creatures native to the Metalorn rainforests, but after the tests caused much of the forest to whither or burn, the daggerfly was one of the last creatures on the planet. They were covered in chitin, and they ate the small animals that fed on the waste from factories on the world."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
