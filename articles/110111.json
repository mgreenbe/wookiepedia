He was responsible for maintaining the Sato's Hammer's systems and customized it to his own specifications. Following a skirmish with an Imperial patrol, R3-A3 and his fellow rebels came into contact with the Spectres and Phoenix Cell. While initially reluctant to leave, R3 and his comrades Gooti Terez and Jonner Jin heeded the warnings of Ezra Bridger and Sabine Wren and managed to escape the system. However, their leader Mart Mattin was left behind. R3 took part in a combined rescue effort to save Mart.

He served captain Mart Mattin, Gooti Terez, and Jonner Jin and was responsible for maintaining their starship, Sato's Hammer. Mart's father was the leader of the Iron Squadron and his son succeeded him after he died. The Iron Squadron had no contact with other rebel cells including Mart's uncle Commander Jun Sato's Phoenix Cell. The Iron Squadron constituted the only rebel group in the system."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Joining the rebellion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2 BBY, the Iron Squadron clashed with an Imperial advance patrol. Despite sustaining damage to their hyperdrive, the Iron Squadron managed to destroy their Imperial opponents with the help of the Spectres and Phoenix Cell. Sato's Hammer destroyed a Gozanti-class cruiser by dropping several cargo containers containing explosives. Later, the Spectres docked their ship, the Ghost, with Sato's Hammer. Hera Syndulla, the leader of the Spectres and Phoenix Leader, attempted to recruit the Iron Squadron. The rebels chanced upon R3-A3 repairing the hyperdrive. R3 entered into a fight with the rebels' astromech droid Chopper, who wanted to fix the hyperdrive. Only Gooti and Ezra Bridger, one of the Spectres, managed to break up the fight. Hera's meeting was unproductive since Mart and his crew refused to leave Mykapo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Ezra convinced Hera to let him have another go at reasoning with Mart, R3 accepted help from Sabine Wren and Chopper to repair the hyperdrive. Despite repairing the hyperdrive, their efforts came to naught when Mart diverted the power to the ship's laser cannons and deflector shields. After Imperial reinforcements under Admiral Kassius Konstantine entered the system, R3-A3 along with Gooti and Jonner heeded Ezra and Sabine's warnings to leave and evacuated aboard the Phantom II, the Spectres' shuttle. However, Mart decided to stay behind and disengaged the Phantom II. He attempted to attack Konstantine's Arquitens-class command cruiser but the ship's engines were disabled. R3-A3 and the other rebels escaped into hyperspace aboard the Phantom II."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "R3-A3 later participated in a joint mission by the Spectres and Iron Squadron to rescue Mart Mattin. After the rebels learnt that Konstantine had attached a magno-mine to the hull of Sato's Hammer, Hera dispatched R3-A3 and Chopper to remove the mine. The two droids were deployed via the Spectres' starship Ghost's cargo bay. R3 was afraid so Chopper pushed him into space. The two droids then activated their rocket boosters and flew to Sato's Hammer. Working together, they removed the magno-mine with R3 removing the magnetic field. The two droids then reattached the mine to cargo box hanging from Sato's Hammer. Under orders from Hera, they entered the ship's cockpit to await pick-up by the Ghost."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "R3-A3 reunited with his captain aboard. Shortly later, rebel forces led by Commander Sato arrived and attacked Konstantine's Imperial forces. After the Ghost picked up Sato's Hammer, they dropped the bomb-laded cargo box onto Konstantine's ship.

The two participated in the attack on Lothal, flying under General Hera Syndulla. The attack failed, and the Rebel fighters were shot down, with a few managing to crash-land in Capital City. Mart and R3 were among those who survived. When Imperial stormtroopers approached Mart's crashed fighter, intending to arrest him, R3 defended the injured and disoriented pilot. The stormtroopers wanted to take the droid captive, as his memory banks would be valuable intelligence. They eventually shot and destroyed R3, shortly before Hera and Chopper arrived and helped take out the Imperials. Hera asked Mart for permission to use R3's transmitter to replace Chopper's, which had been damaged when her fighter crash-landed.
