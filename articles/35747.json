If the pilot of the vehicle let go, in situations where they perhaps would fall off the bike, the dead-man switch would cut the engine and leave the repulsors running. It could also refer to a type of booby trap where an individual would set explosives to trigger if a certain condition is met."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
