Located south of the eastern part of the city, the Wilds were so named for the waterfall and rivers located in the region. The Wilds were filled with yozusks, gundarks, sleens, and vine cats, with lightning pylons that drew power from the planet's eternal storms for Kaas City dotting the jungle. The Initiate's Path ran west of the Wilds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
