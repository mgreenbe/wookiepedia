Unlike many of his fellow monks, Evilo did not seek concepts like \"truth\" or \"enlightenment\", and continued to communicate with the outside world in whole sentences rather than images. He instead spent his days amassing more information on the universe, something he could not do in a normal lifetime. He also befriended the frog-dog Buboicullaar and taught him the ways of the B'omarr."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
