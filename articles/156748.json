The bearded male was one of many Imperial Knights who accompanied Fel to the planet Agamar in that year as bodyguards while the Emperor secretly met with members of the Jedi Order. On the planet's grassy plains, every Jedi and Imperial Knight donned a farmer disguise, and several Imperial Knight Masters stood with Fel as he and the Jedi Master K'Kruhk negotiated an alliance against the Sith Lord Darth Krayt's Empire. The bearded male and several other Imperial Knights stood away from the talks, however, promoting their farmer deception by pretending to work on a field. Fel and K'Kruhk struck an agreement without incident, but the proceedings were interrupted soon after by Nyna Calixte\u2014the Director of Imperial Intelligence for Krayt's Empire\u2014who was secretly an ally of Fel's."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Calixte rode a local animal into the field where the bearded male stood and dismounted after two Imperial Knights fired blaster rifles at her steed. She told the Jedi and Imperial Knights that Krayt's Sith knew about the meeting, and that a Sith\u2013Imperial task force was on its way to Agamar to capture or kill the Emperor. When a Sith strike team rose from nearby swamps, a battle began. The bearded male shed his farmer robe and drew his lightsaber when Antares Draco, the leader of the Imperial Knights, called on his Knights to defend the Emperor. The Jedi participated in the attempt to protect the Emperor, and at least ten Sith fell to the blades of their enemies, as well as to Calixte's blaster. Several Imperial Knights and Jedi died in the fray, but Fel and most of the survivors evacuated the battle on the escape shuttle Defender One."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As an Imperial Knight, the bearded male was part of an organization whose membership was limited to beings who could use the Force. Imperial Knights were said to be among the most talented and dangerous Force-users in the galaxy.
