Representing Kreia, the leitmotif plays in the loading screen of The Sith Lords, as well as in the first cut scene featuring the damaged Ebon Hawk coursing through space. The motif is played as an HK-50 series assassin droid steps out of a fire inside the Ebon Hawk, and sounds throughout the entirety of the player character's first conversation with Kreia in The Sith Lords. The motif is then played with a faster tempo during the Ebon Hawk's escape from the Harbinger at the Peragus asteroid field, and a similar rendition of the music is later played during the player character's duel against Kreia at the Trayus Core on Malachor V."}]}
