It measured 22 meters in length and was capable of carrying 40 passengers and a ton of cargo."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The airship consisted of several lift-balloons, filled with lighter-than-air gases that are metabolized in a self-contained organic engine. The hull of the craft was equipped with long runners for sea-skimming. For short trips, the craft never left the surface of the sea, sliding from place to place, powered by twin propellers. Longer trips required a full inflation of the lift-balloons. A vert'bo airship could reach an altitude of five kilometers without repulsorlifts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Traditionally, vert'bo airships were not armed, but on particularly dangerous routes, they could be fitted with mounted blaster cannons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
