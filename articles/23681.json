When Kyp Durron was controlled by the Sith Lord Exar Kun and took control of the superweapon Sun Crusher, the star was shot with a resonance torpedo. Upon impact, the torpedo burrowed into the star's core releasing dense packets of energy that rendered the star's core unstable, initiating a chain-reaction supernova. The star ripped itself apart in the explosion, sending waves of energy and radiation out across the system, destroying every planet in its path."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
