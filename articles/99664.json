It consisted primarily of a blue gelatinous substance topped with pieces that fizzed when consumed. When Garra first met Resistance spy Vi Moradi in 34 ABY, she slurped the snack from a glass dish and then used her fingers to crush the dish, but Moradi did not flinch. Garra's snack was eponymously named, as was her drinking establishment, Oga's Cantina, which was located in Black Spire Outpost on the planet Batuu. Oga's Obsession was suitable for consumption by humans and was served in a shallow, round dish at Oga's Cantina."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Oga's Obsession is a snack that has been sold to customers at Oga's Cantina in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge since the theme park opened in 2019.
