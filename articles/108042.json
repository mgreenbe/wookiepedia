Its approval came after the Bureau's previous success in overriding HoloNet feeds to distribute propaganda that led to demoralization and low recruitment rates in the Empire's enemies. Thus, the Dark Council approved of Project Eclipse that was an inter-ministerial program which involved military strikes and assassinations on a galaxy wide scale that culminated in a key broadcast that consisted of a message of intimidation to the enemies of the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The key to the project involved hijacking of a vital HoloNet hub by the Outreach Bureau on Nar Shaddaa. However, the Hutt Data Haven at Network Access was heavily guarded and thus the Bureau required the aid of an Imperial representative to clear the way in order for the speech to be broadcast."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
