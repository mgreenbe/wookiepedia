Pybus was the site of a number of ruins, one of which Vortga built his complex around. It was also, however, considered taboo for any Hutts to travel to, making his complex rather secure. As Vortga became more paranoid in his later years, he ordered the assassination of all of the servants that knew of the complex. Only Lalkan survived."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vortga died centuries before the Battle of Yavin.
