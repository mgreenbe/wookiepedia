It was located in a small frontier system. It was a peaceful place inhabited by artisans and farmers. Its people were known as the Okyaabi. It was conquered and enslaved by the Mandalorians during the Mandalorian Wars for less than a week before the Okyaabi revolted and retook their world, rejoining the Republic.
