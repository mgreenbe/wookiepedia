Vader followed Red Squadron which was targeting a thermal exhaust port, which was a flaw designed by the Imperial scientist Galen Walton Erso to act as a sabotage to reveal the battle station's vulnerability to destroy the battle station itself. Vader shot many pilots until only Luke Skywalker remains. Suddenly, the Millennium Falcon piloted by Han Solo flew out and shot Backstabber, killing him. His death shocked Vader as Mithel tried to escape but accidentally flew over Vader, damaging the Sith Lord's TIE Advanced x1 and crashing his TIE fighter into a wall. Vader and his damaged TIE Advanced x1 flew away, damaged and incapacitated. Luke Skywalker destroyed the Death Star after both of his accompanying wingmen fell."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
