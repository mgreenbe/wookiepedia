Many millennia after Xim's reign, the historian Bleys Harand described the remains of the shipyards in his work of literature Travels Amid Strange Stars, which described his search for a contemporary depiction of Xim. All that remained of the shipyards by this time however, were coils of steel which had been darkened in color due to irradiation, and were covered in markings from micrometeorite strikes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The shipyards were supposed to be first mentioned in The Essential Guide to Warfare, a sourcebook released in 2012 written by Jason Fry and Paul R.
