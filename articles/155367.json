In 22 BBY, he took part in a skirmish that took place in Cuipernam, the capital city of the planet Ansion. During the skirmish, mercenaries under the employ of Soergg attempted to stop Jedi Master Luminara Unduli, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, and their Padawans Anakin Skywalker and Barriss Offee, from reaching the municipal hall where the vote for Ansion's secession was taking place. While the Jedi were hiding in a nearby building, the well-armed Vrot\u2014who had been hiding behind two civilians\u2014aimed his weapon at Master Unduli while she was distracted by two other assailants. However, before the Vrot could pull the trigger, Tooqui, a male Gwurran, jumped onto his head. The Vrot threw Tooqui off him, but before he could shoot the Gwurran, he was attacked by the Ansionians Kyakhta and Bulgan, who proceeded to beat the Vrot with the help of the Gwurran."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This Vrot appeared in the 2002 novel The Approaching Storm, which was written by Alan Dean Foster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
