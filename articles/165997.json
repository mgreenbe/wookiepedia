Armed with an axial superlaser capable of destroying entire worlds, the Xyston-class represented the culmination of Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious' vision of a galaxy forced into submission by sheer military might and intimidation. Given that construction of the extensive fleet began during the Imperial Era, the Sith cultists inhabiting the hidden Sith fortress world of Exegol modeled their warships on the design of the state-of-the-art Imperial I-class Star Destroyers, considered the pinnacle of military technology at the time. During the First Order/Resistance War, Darth Sidious ordered Allegiant General Enric Pryde to deploy the fleet of Xyston-class Star Destroyers from Exegol, although their launch was prevented by the Resistance and their allies at the Battle of Exegol, thereby sparing the galaxy from an eternity of subjugation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "General characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Xyston-class was nearly identical to the older Imperial-class Star Destroyer, with key differences including a larger size (an Imperial-class ship being 1,600 meters long, while the Xyston-class ships were one-and-a-half times larger, at 2,406 meters in length from stem to stern), red accents along the hull of the vessel, and a large axial superlaser capable of destroying planets, which took the place of a standard Imperial-class Star Destroyer's main hangar space. While equipped with deflector shields, the Xyston-class could not activate them while inside Exegol's atmosphere. These Star Destroyers also required a navigational beacon in order to leave Exegol, because ships the size of the Xyston-class could not ascend to hyperspace launch altitude safely through the atmospheric disturbances and magnetic crosswinds of Exegol. A navigation tower existed on the planet for this purpose."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As its standard complement, each Xyston-class Star Destroyer carried a total of 72 TIE/dg starfighters. To facilitate starfighter operations, Xyston-class ships contained two TIE fighter launch bays next to the axial superlaser. Each ship had a crew of 29,585 officers and enlisted crew, far less than the 37,000 of an Imperial-class Star Destroyer. This reduction in crew size was achieved via the use of extremely efficient automation systems."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Axial superlaser"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Star Destroyers were armed with a large axial superlaser and flanked by two smaller starfighter hangars, located at precisely the same place where the larger ventral hangar bay of a conventional Imperial-class Star Destroyer was supposed to be. While it would not destroy a planet instantly like the superlasers of the Death Stars, the cannon would obliterate a planet by firing at the target in a sustained burst. These superlasers were connected directly to the Star Destroyer's solar ionization reactor, and severe damage to them would destroy the ship itself."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Xyston-class Star Destroyer was capable of obliterating an entire planet with a single shot of its axial superlaser. Forming the entirety of the Final Order, the Xyston-class Star Destroyers were intended to be shipped out en masse to the known galaxy and force its populace into submission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Xyston-class Star Destroyers were under construction by the Sith Eternal cultists by the time shortly after the Escape from Cloud City, in 3 ABY. The technology they were to be equipped with, more specifically their axial superlasers, would be prototyped upon the First Order Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought. They comprised the Final Order, a fleet stationed on Exegol which awaited deployment during the final campaigns of the First Order/Resistance War. When Supreme Leader Kylo Ren arrived on Exegol and met with Darth Sidious, the Sith Lord raised his entire fleet from beneath the planet's surface and offered Ren the chance to rule the galaxy under the perpetual reign of a new Sith Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the duel on Kef Bir and Ren's subsequent return to the light side of the Force, Sidious ordered Allegiant General Enric Pryde to dispatch a Star Destroyer to Kijimi to destroy it as a show of the Final Order's might. The Star Destroyer Derriphan was then sent out from Exegol, thus becoming the first, and only Xyston-class ship to ever leave Exegol's atmosphere, and destroyed the planet easily. Eventually, the entire armada of Star Destroyers was destroyed during the pivotal Battle of Exegol, as the Resistance discovered the Star Destroyers' weakness, being the ability to destroy the entire vessel by targeting the axial superlaser."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Without the promised reinforcements of the Sith Star Destroyers, the First Order was defeated in the First Order/Resistance War.
