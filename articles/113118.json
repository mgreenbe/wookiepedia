Ree-Yees despised the Hutt employer, but not as much as Buboicullaar\u2014who was in fact sentient\u2014hated Ree-Yees.  During a performance in Jabba's palace, Ree-Yees was present when Jabba dropped his slave girl Oola into the pit of his rancor Pateesa. The next day when the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker was dropped into Jabba's rancor pit to be eaten, Ree-Yees was amongst those who crowded round to watch the battle and cheer on the rancor. The Gran later rode on board Jabba's sail barge Khetanna to the Great Pit of Carkoon, where Skywalker was to be fed to a sarlacc alongside the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca. Skywalker and his companions managed to break free during the execution attempt, killing Jabba and destroying the barge and Ree-Yees along with it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ree-Yees was originally set to be the character of Gial Ackbar in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, however after reviewing sculpts the filmmakers decided to go with the familiar fishy-looking Ackbar instead."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
