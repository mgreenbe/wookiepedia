They were tolerated by the Yrashu, but looked down upon as delinquent and deviant individuals. It was the only class distinction in the Yrashu culture. Before the Battle of Baskarn a group of Rebels ran into a band of Low ones who had taken the blasters belonging to a Rebel recon group from the Advance Base Baskarn, who had been eaten by a large predatory flightless bird. The Rebels easily defeated the Low Ones and was accepted into a friendly tribe of Yrashu who had been harassed by the blaster-armed Low Ones."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
