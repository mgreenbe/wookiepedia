Its string and arrows were made from plasma that emitted a bright pink or orange glow. During the Clone Wars, a special group of Nightsisters known as the Hunters used those bows to kill targets designated by Mother Talzin. It used a plasma generator connected to a lightweight alloy bow to produce a dangerous energy bowstring. When drawn by its energy-proof grip, the bow generates a powerful solid plasma bolt that is then fired like an arrow from a traditional bow. It was possible for at least one variety of the bow to fire a plasma cable to bridge gaps, which could then be crossed utilizing the bow's body as a handlebar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
