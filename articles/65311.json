That edict was issued following of the Life Day Revelers on Vaiken Spacedock. It ordered all Imperial personnel not to engage in any of the seasonal, cheerful activities proposed by the Revelers, which were considered unbecoming of the Empire, as well as placed a ban on and warning about various items representing the holiday, including Sleigh I (due to its jingle bells being suspected to indicate the parcels contain explosives), Life Day Holo-Trees, and Cyan Spheres (the last of which had most of its description being heavily redacted)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The code for the edict, GR-1NC4, is reference to the Grinch, a character who also loathes the holiday of Christmas, which Life Day is inspired from."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
