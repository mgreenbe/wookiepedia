He was eventually betrayed and overthrown by his followers, forcing him to flee the planet Korriban for the Deep Core. Andeddu made the world of Prakith his domain where he ruled for centuries as a deity until his physical demise, at which time he entombed himself in an attempt to deprive his pursuers of the power they sought to steal. Prior to his physical death, Andeddu stored all of his wisdom within a holocron which also contained his most arcane secret: the ability to cheat death by transferring one's essence into another vessel.

Krayt, who suffered from a Yuuzhan Vong slave seed infestation that threatened to leave him bereft of sentience, allowed his lieutenant Darth Wyyrlok III to access Andeddu's holocron in search of possible solutions. The device led the Chagrian Sith on a journey to Andeddu's Keep on Prakith, where he encountered and defeated the Malevolence cultists, but in doing so, he revived the ancient body of Darth Andeddu. The Dark Lord then dueled Wyyrlok on a battlefield of the mind, a contest which ultimately resulted in Andeddu's demise.

Over time, Andeddu grew in wisdom and developed considerable mastery over the dark side of the Force. He studied the ways of the original Lords of the Sith, namely the bizarre rituals of one known as Karness Muur, and built the foundation of his powers upon Muur's teachings. Though Muur himself delved into the craft of dark side healing, Andeddu was interested in more than that\u2014he sought ways to cheat death entirely. He was ultimately successful, and found a method of preserving the consciousness of his mind, should his physical body perish. Andeddu also learned the secret of transferring his essence into another vessel, should the need arise.

Because Andeddu refused to share his intelligence, the Sith Lords banded together and plotted to first take his Sith secrets for themselves and then destroy him. Andeddu was not blind to the machinations of his detractors and grew increasingly wary of them. He felt any further hesitation on his part would result in his enemies successfully overtaking him. Darth Andeddu was soon betrayed and overthrown by his followers, and forced to abscond from Korriban. Prior to his escape, he created a false tomb on Korriban to deceive potential pursuers. When the Sith Lords realized that Andeddu had fled, they searched relentlessly for him, through the Force and otherwise, but to no avail\u2014Andeddu had soundly eluded them by returning to a private stronghold on his homeworld of Prakith. However, the fear of losing all he had amassed still threatened to consume him and, because of this, Andeddu recorded a great deal of his knowledge in Sith spellbooks and scrolls that he stored within the belly of his fortress.

His followers came to revere him as their \"God-King\"; an immortal being whom they believed would forever reign supreme. The collapse of the hyperspace lanes which led to Prakith resulted in the isolation of its inhabitants, and allowed the Dark Lord to maintain unfettered dominion over the Deep Core world. However, paranoia caused Andeddu to still believe that his enemies would eventually arrive to steal his lore. He entombed himself, surrounded by his books and scrolls, content with the idea that he would carry his secrets into death with him. His holocron was kept inside of his sarcophagus with his physical remains, and both stayed hidden for thousands of years after his passing. Meanwhile, Andeddu's Malevolence cult continued to immerse themselves in the dark side while maintaining worship of their God-King.

Although the Council was aware of Andeddu's holocron, they chose not to pursue it, deeming that a journey into the Deep Core was too perilous to risk. Regardless of their best efforts, a Sith artifact broker by the name of Argel Tenn acquired a reverent scroll which gave an abbreviated account of Darth Andeddu's omnipotent sovereignty over Prakith. The manuscript was sold to the current Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Bane, who sought to obtain Andeddu's secrets of eternal life. He braved the treacherous hyperspace lanes that led to Prakith in search of Darth Andeddu's holocron. His quest was ultimately fruitful; he found the device within Andeddu's tomb and learned all of its secrets, but subsequently lost it after he had been captured by agents of Serra, princess of the planet Doan.

The two battled each other in the Valley of the Dark Lords for possession of Andeddu's holocron, with Vos ultimately proving the victor and gaining much favor with Tyranus. Satisfied that the holocron was now in his custody, Tyranus activated the pyramidal artifact to manifest a lightsaber-wielding avatar of Andeddu's likeness, from which Tyranus hoped to obtain the might of the ancient Sith. Also, in reward for Vos' success, Tyranus revealed another of the many mysteries contained within Andeddu's holocron\u2014a bloodshine lightsaber crystal, the same one that had powered Andeddu's own weapon during his time among the living.

By 40 ABY, research into the origins of the Darth title had also been conducted by a suspected Sith sympathizer named Ingo Wavlud. He surmised that Darth may have been derived from the Rakata word \"Daritha\", meaning \"Emperor.\" He also touched upon the possibility of it stemming from a Rakata phrase, \"darr tah,\" which translated into \"victory over death.\""}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Sith \"pretender\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 137 ABY, a new Sith Order had claimed sovereignty over the galaxy, created by a fallen Jedi named A'Sharad Hett.

Though able to combat the effects of the seeds through his growing strength in the dark side, Hett was slowly losing his battle with them.

Obsessed with acquiring such skill, Krayt repeatedly attempted to glean Andeddu's expertise from the holocron, none of which its gatekeeper would yield. In his last endeavor, Krayt accessed the holocrons of the deceased Dark Lords Darth Nihilus and Darth Bane along with Andeddu's. He was repeatedly rebuked by their gatekeepers and held in contempt by the ancient Sith for diluting the potency of the dark side by dividing it between the members of his Order. Darth Andeddu and his fellow Dark Lords mocked Krayt, exposing his fear of being consumed by his Yuuzhan Vong slave seeds. Together, the gatekeepers of Andeddu's and Bane's holocrons turned their power on Krayt to bring about that which scared him most\u2014they caused the Vonduun crab armor in which he was clad to consume him.

The gatekeeper's interest peaked in the midst of his refusals, however, when Wyyrlok admitted that he knew of the stronghold on Prakith and then offered to restore the Dark Lord to life.

The Chagrian quickly defeated and killed all of Andeddu's minions, save one named Gerlun, who pledged himself to Wyyrlok in the face of defeat. Gerlun then led Wyyrlok into the bowels of the Keep, and when they could proceed no further, the Chagrian beckoned Andeddu's image to reveal the entrance to his tomb. In the language of the ancient Sith, the gatekeeper spoke the words that accessed the hidden sepulcher, and in its center lay Andeddu's sarcophagus. The Dark Lord's image suggested that Wyyrlok should set the holocron upon the body's chest, but Wyyrlok preferred to instead help himself to Andeddu's abundance of ancient texts and scrolls.

The Dark Lord conjured illusions of lava and flame to overwhelm his opponent, but they were turned against him when Wyyrlok discovered that Andeddu's strength was only within his mind. He was continually berated by Wyyrlok, who believed that Andeddu deserved none of his accumulated wisdom for hiding from his adversaries. Andeddu watched in horror as Wyyrlok turned the flames against his precious books and scrolls, then ultimately on him. Consumed by his own fears, Darth Andeddu was defeated by what he perceived as real, and died a second death at the hands of Darth Wyyrlok. His corpse was levitated by the Chagrian, who replaced it within the sarcophagus that had housed it for generations. The destruction of Andeddu's hoard had only been a ruse by his opponent, however; everything remained intact, and after some time studying them, Wyyrlok concluded that none of the material contained anything useful for his purposes.
