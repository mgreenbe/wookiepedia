They were responsible for creating uniform legal code to be enforced in sectors across the Galactic Empire. The implementation of the new legal system increased efficiency due to the efforts of Justice personnel. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, Crueya Vandron attempted to write the idea of \"Imperial Infallibility\" into the legal code. The effort was resisted by Justice personnel, causing Imperial Security Bureau personnel to harass members and intimidate the politically-connected by charging less-prominent members with fabricated charges. Progress began to assign new personnel to Justice who shared the Emperor's view on the way the law should work."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
