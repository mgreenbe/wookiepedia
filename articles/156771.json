He and his partner arrived at Darth Nyriss's stronghold in a airspeeder firing the auto-targeting blaster cannon at the Sith Lord, who took shelter behind the statue of the Emperor. After seeing that they were turning around to make another pass, Scourge threw his lightsaber at the speeder clipping the back end. They abandoned the speeder, after beheading the statue of the Emperor and crash landing. He attempted to free his blaster rifle of the wreckage, while his partner drew her blaster pistols and attempted to defend her partner.
