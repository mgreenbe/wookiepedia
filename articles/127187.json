Skyscrapers were sometimes called Superskytowers, cloudcutters, starscrapers, or highrises. One such skyscraper was the Shawken Spire, which was destroyed in 18,780 BBY and reconstructed thereafter. A variation of the standard skyscraper was the spacescraper, a type of building that presumably brushed the edge of a planet's atmosphere."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As civilization spread across a given planet the demand for land proceeded apace. Urban development and the demand for more living space meant buildings would grow upward by building ever taller and taller buildings. By 90,000 BBY, the metropolis eventually known as Galactic City on Coruscant had grown to the point where new levels were built atop old ones, beginning a trend of upward building that continued for thousands of years. By 4000 BBY, Taris had done the same. By the founding of the Republic, numerous Core World planets had multi-kilometer highrises dotting their landscapes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
