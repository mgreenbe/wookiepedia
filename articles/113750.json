During the Imperial Era, Remy acquired a Path engine, a specialized hyperdrive utilized by the Nihil marauder operation during the High Republic Era. Remy brought the Path engine to the planet Corellia, where he sold it to Beol De'Rruyet of De'Rruyet Industries. De'Rruyet intended to replicate the Path engine's abilities, revolutionizing lightspeed travel. After meeting with fellow smuggler Sana Starros, Remy was tracked down by General Vukorah of the Unbroken Clan criminal syndicate, who interrogated Remy about the device. Vukorah was informed by one of her operatives that Remy had previously met with Starros, and Remy attempted to lead the Unbroken Clan into pursuing her and letting him go. Vukorah killed Remy and took his datapad, which contained information on where he found the Path engine. The datapad was later taken by Starros and the rogue archaeologist Doctor Chelli Aphra, who had been sent to stop De'Rruyet's usage of the Path engine by Lady Domina Tagge of the Tagge family."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
