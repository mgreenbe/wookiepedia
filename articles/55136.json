He sung the \"Ballad of Cham Syndulla\", while playing a stringed instrument. Syndulla opposed the song, claiming he was a soldier, not a legend.

However, even the combined forces of the Republic and the freedom fighters were inferior to the battle droids, so Cham ordered Gobi and the freedom fighters to retreat. Even if the Jedi and the Clone troopers were trying hard to defend the planet, Gobi was less averse to standing, but he obeyed Chams command. While the General Di and the remaining clones were going to a battle against the droid army one last time, allowing Gobi and other Twi'leks to escape over the mountains.

When Jedi Master Mace Windu and his platoon arrived to aid the freedom fighters, Gobi joined in the battle in retaking Lessu and the capture of Wat Tambor.
