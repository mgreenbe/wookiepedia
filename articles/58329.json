He ran a spice racket out of a small hospital in Doaba Guerfel. Circa 1 ABY, a group of Rogue CorSec criminals led by Xyrias Undea harassed his business. Around the same time, a CorSec agent working for Captain Vitala Baize interrogated Baric about a criminal organization known as the Chirq Council. The thug begged the agent to deal with his Rogue CorSec problem in exchange of information. The agent thus fought and killed several Rogue CorSec miscreants, including Xyrias Undea. Gwhirrye Baric later agreed with giving information about the spice dealer Trins Evnar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gwhirrye Baric was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
