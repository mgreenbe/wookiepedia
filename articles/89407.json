Earlier, Organa had duped the Foreman of the Techno Union, Wat Tambor, into thinking that Alderaan wanted to join the Confederacy of Independent Systems, as well as telling him that he wanted to convert Alderaan into a factory world like Metalorn, and wanted to receive a tour of the world. In reality, Organa was journeying to Metalorn to free the imprisoned Jedi Master Shaak Ti, who had been captured by the Techno Union. During the tour, Organa and company witnessed the Metalorn garbage speeders hard at work in the Wasteland of Metalorn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
