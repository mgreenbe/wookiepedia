Hosdra, a member of the Myyydril tribe, attempted to kill the leader of the Kerritamba Village. As a result, the Myyydril were forced to leave their home. They wandered the forests for days until they came upon the caverns within the Mysess Glade. They constructed a new home within the caverns, and began rebuilding their clan. By 25 BBY, however, the tribe's population began to dwindle for an unknown reason."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was later discovered that Urnsor'is, non-sentient parasites, were feeding on the Wookiees. In a desperate attempt for survival, the Myyydril Wookiees fought a vicious battle with the Urnsor'is, but were unable to defeat them. The Poltur Virus soon spread throughout the tribe, further declining their numbers. A female Twi'lek, Yraka Nes, spent many weeks trying to find a cure for the virus, helping the Myyydril remain alive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Known members of the clan included the clan's chief, Kallaarac; Hosdra; Attiera; and her daughter, Froera."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
