The blockade was put in place after Galactic Emperor Palpatine became aware of the fact that planet's Bosph species were controlled by a Force-sensitive government. The blockade began shortly before the Bombardment of Bosph and both events were orchestrated by the sector's Moff, a Human named Harsh. Those few Bosph who survived the orbital bombardment of the planet were almost all kept on their devastated homeworld by the bombardment although a few did escape. All Bosph, including those trapped, took up a policy of dis-remembrance toward the Empire meaning they refused to acknowledge it's existence, including the existence of the blockade."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
