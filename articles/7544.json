Anti-grav loaders were known to be equipped with them. The unit worked by shooting an anti-gravity beam at heavy objects, apparently making them weightless, and then guiding them to their desired destination. It could apparently be used as a combat countermeasure as well, as Kirk Windjammer once used his anti-grav unit to deflect an incoming photon missile."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
