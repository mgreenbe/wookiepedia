Under the name of Tenloss Corporation, it owned multiple small companies of various degrees of legality. Those companies produced starships, weapons, and equipment--mostly for the Tenloss Syndicate use. Tenloss' primary interest was controlled by a central governing council. Each company in the Tenloss corporation had its own hierarchy and were directed by one of the sub-councils. Their starships, armor and weapons were also provided to normal paying customers, though most of them were considered illegal and therefore included a certain risk. The organization was mostly concerned with making profits, but when its interests were threatened, it brought full weight of its might on its enemies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They owned the Modirin Mining Concern, and as a result of the mining company's chromium scam on Aduba-3, they controlled most of the planet.
