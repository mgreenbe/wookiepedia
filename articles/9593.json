During the battle, Rowan accidentally fired the StarScavenger's gun turret at the Imperial Gozanti-class cruiser, destroying ship. This alarmed both the Imperial and rebel pilots.

However, Rowan accidentally blew it up with the head of an AT-ST walker. As a result, the Freemakers embarked on another salvage run to the planet Nal Kapok with their B1-series battle droid Roger to obtain more scrap metal.
