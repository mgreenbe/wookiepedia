Most likely a relative of the Fire Breather, the Fire Spitter was attached to the wrist of the warrior it was used by. To use them, the bones in the warrior's forearm was removed and then replaced by the Fire Spitter's spine. The outer parts then wrapped around the warrior until it was called. When activated, the Fire Spitter ejected a ball of flaming and highly explosive biomatter that was created by chemicals within the Spitter. Because of the danger of such weapons, they saw limited use."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
