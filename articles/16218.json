Nevertheless, being an opportunistic informer, Benkudi wanted to sell anything he knew to the Hutts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, at this point, the Hutts were already aware of Ungasan's podracing activities. They used one of their employees, Jer Blankuna, to hire independent agents to find Ree. Blankuna pretended to be Ree's worried father, and he falsely claimed to have been contacted by Benkudi. The agents followed this trail. Ree, who was familiar with Benkudi's traits, advised Ungasan to silence him. Ungasan in turn sent four contract workers of the CSA with vibrodaggers to beat Benkudi up. Nevertheless, Benkudi told the independent agents everything he knew, and some things he believed\u2014like Ungasan being a former lieutenant for the Hutts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
