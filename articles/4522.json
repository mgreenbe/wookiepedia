These mines were stationary until they acquired a target, usually a starfighter. The mines pursued the target until they exploded or the target went out of range, in which case the mine stopped. They were also capable of operating in space, and the space versions featured a built-in laser cannon. The Trade Federation employed these mines during their invasion of the planet Naboo and used them to guard installations such as the orbiting satellite Comm 4, a base, and the Trade Federation Airbase. The smuggler Borvo the Hutt also employed these mines to guard the entrance of his outpost. Many of these types of mines were destroyed by the Royal Naboo Security Forces pilot Gavyn Sykes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These mines appear in the 2000 video game Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
