It could be use as a melee weapon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Developed by the makers of the venerable G2-GE beamdrill, the G9-GP was a handheld, low-powered, precision beamdrill that emitted a rapidly pulsing plasma beam around a millimeter thick, allowing it to cut through relatively thick material. Appearing as long rods with a tank at one end, and a variable-angle plasma cutter at the other, the G9-GP were primarily tools; though in a pinch they could be used as effective improvised weapons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
