Antares Draco, Niin's former Imperial Knight apprentice, had been sent by the Emperor to kill the deserter and was present on the rooftop as well. Draco and Fel both called on Niin to remember his vows, but he shoved Draco away with the Force and struck Fel down. Draco retaliated and mortally wounded Niin; he believed his former master to be dead and returned to the Imperial Knights. Niin survived and joined the One Sith, becoming the Sith Inquisitor Darth Havok."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
