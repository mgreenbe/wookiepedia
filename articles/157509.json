The scoundrel was an in-universe self-portrait of Trevas. The book's editor, Erich Schoeneweiss, came up with the idea of having the Human lose his starship as a joke on Trevas. The image was used to illustrate the varying spacefaring species. The 2009 Scavenger's Guide to Droids sourcebook pictured the Human scoundrel flying a starship, but it is not stated that this is the starship described in this article."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
