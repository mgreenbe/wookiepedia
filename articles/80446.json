When the mining facility collapsed into the lava sea, Kenobi saved himself onto a lava skiff while Vader jumped on top of a DLC-13 mining droid. From there, Vader jumped on the skiff and continued to duel his former master. As they reached land, Kenobi jumped off first and urged Vader to surrender.
