In the event they were ever moved from a secure location, they were upgraded to classification Class A Code Red. During transfers, these individuals were unknowingly injected with poisons to ensure that, if captured, they would be of no use to the enemy. Doctors available during the transfer would keep the poison from becoming lethal by administering regular doses of the antidote."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
