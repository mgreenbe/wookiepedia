During the Separatist Crisis she lent her talents to the Galactic Republic's Loyalist Committee at the behest of Breha's husband Senator Bail Organa and helped execute the final design of the Millennial Celebration Invitation meant for use during the celebration of the thousandth anniversary of the Republic's founding. The invitation was based on concepts and layouts produced by the artist Naveela Betuine, but went through 250 revisions during the administration of Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum, as he could not decide what he wanted the invitation to look like. Control of the design was eventually passed onto Senator Sheev Palpatine, who decided on a final design; however, the invitation never saw distribution as the Republic reformed into the Galactic Empire under Palpatine before reaching the anniversary."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dashira Dobeq was first mentioned in the reference book Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released on October 25, 2016."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
