Originally a small community for miners and their families, the evacuation of Atraken and the influx of refugees pushed the population up to around 40,000 by 6 ABY. New Atraken City was connected to Starport Touchdown via access paths, and by double-track subway to the Old Mine. Two cantinas, the Last Resort and Downside, were located in New Atraken City."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
