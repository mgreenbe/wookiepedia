Largely populated by Humans and Twi'leks, Hriin was situated on bluffs high above the Hriin River's north bank. A fishing community, the town had no spaceport but was equipped with landing pads for airspeeders. The water from the river powered the city's generators, which were prone to malfunction. The city government, overseen by an elected chancellor, was responsible for the operation of the town and its industry.By the time of the reign of the Galactic Empire, Hriin was the closest settlement to Acablas that was still populated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
