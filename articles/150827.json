He was the youngest member of the crew and had a habit of taking the shuttle to a nearby town weekly to spend time with another boy that he was attracted to. Because of this, he was absent the night that his crewmates learned of the New Republic Attack on Pandem Nai while gathered in a local cantina and did not witness the commotion when \"Devon Lhent\", a former major in the Galactic Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing, expressed his displeasure with the New Republic. Tyros learned of the situation by the following morning and asked Lhent about it while partnered with him on the rig. Not wanting word of the incident to spread further, Lhent downplayed its severity. The next night, Tyros, Lhent and their other co-workers traveled to Bakerstown to celebrate the Red Moon Festival. There, he introduced the older man to his friends, encouraged him to talk to them about their work, which he did for around half an hour. When Lhent left, Tyros covertly assured him that he would help if he ever needed anything and told to let him know if he was interested in anyone there because he knew everyone."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tyros was a sociable young man with many friends and acquaintances on Vernid who claimed to know \"everyone.\" He was not the best of workers and had a bad habit leaving equipment in the water after finishing work.
