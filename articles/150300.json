It was built by King Jafan around 832 BBY to entertain the rulers of the formerly independent city-states that had merged to form a united Naboo kingdom under his rule. After Naboo joined the Galactic Republic eight hundred and forty-seven years before the Clone Wars, the chambers collectively known as the Turret Room were used to house visiting dignitaries from other worlds and their staff. Throughout history, that section of the palace among those that were extended frequently by the succeeding monarchs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was in the Turret Room that the famous Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi was granted the title of Jedi Knight by Yoda, Grand Master of the Jedi Order, in the year 32 BBY. At the time, the room barely contained one table, several high back seats and a few low armchairs. Around 1 BBY, the tower that housed the Turret Room was briefly featured in a commercial released by the Star Tours travel agency to promote trips to Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Layout"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Turret Room's suite of chambers was located behind the throne room building, at the top level of a square tower\u2014one of the many towers that made up the rear side of the palace. Like the throne room itself, those many-windowed chambers were walled with red, grey and brownish marble slabs, and they contained only a few, simple furnitures, in keeping with the austere style featured everywhere in the palace. Their floor was also made of marble and was ornate with a large motif consisting of concentric squares. Attached to the suite was a small chapel where the Naboo sovereign could pay homage to his or her predecessors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Turret Room was one of the locations featured in the 1999 movie Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, the first installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Although the movie itself and its young readers' adaptation clearly established the Turret Room as a part of the Royal Palace, in the adult readers' novelization, the chamber in which Yoda knighted Obi-Wan Kenobi was part of Theed's Funeral Temple. The proper location of the Turret Room was also confirmed in the movie's script as is available in the interactive CD-ROM Star Wars: Episode I Insider's Guide."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
