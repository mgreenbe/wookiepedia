Later, the First Order used an updated variant of the AT-ST within their military."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "AT-STs were commonly used to screen the flanks of larger assault walkers for major ground operations. The Empire used them for swift reconnaissance and troop support. As such, they were essential for cleaning up minor resistance along the path of a planned invasion route, and could quickly eliminate any small threats that evaded an AT-AT's barrage. The walker was commonly used on anti-personnel hunting missions, and was piloted by two AT-ST drivers with superior skills of balance and agility."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "AT-STs were equipped with two chin-mounted MS-4 twin blaster cannons capable of firing at a range of two kilometers. It also featured one cheek-mounted 88i twin light blaster cannon and one cheek-mounted DW-3 concussion grenade launcher capable of doing massive damage to enemy vehicles and ground troops at close range. They were excellent at dealing with large amounts of infantry as well as mounted turrets that were too risky to be taken out with rocket launchers. Its clawed feet could slash apart wires and fences at ground level."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Reinforced armor plates enveloped the control cabin, protecting the two-person crew. Its two armored viewports were deliberately set to give any viewer the unsettling sensation of staring into the face of a soulless beast or oversized combat droid without actually being needed due to their impressive sensor package. Inside the control cabin, the command module featured a holographic 360-degree view of the combat zone. The \"head\" itself was capable of rotating 240 degrees side to side, greatly benefiting the gunner's target-acquisition abilities and capabilities for destruction. The walker's deceptively rickety gait belied a potent patrol vehicle. Gyros, flexible joints, footpad sensors, and shock absorbers formed a sophisticated system that controlled balance and stabilized the walker across a variety of terrains."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite its speed and agility, an AT-ST walker's offensive and defensive power were significantly compromised. Offensively, its weapons systems were only good against lightly armored targets at close range. Defensively, its lighter armor could repel attacks from small-arms fire, but not laser cannons, missiles, or other heavy ordnance. Its armor did not cover its entire frame, lest the walker lose its agility. Striking the walker's unprotected gyros underneath the command module could destabilize the walker and cause it to fall. Additionally, deep trenches or cable lines leveled at the height of the AT-ST's ankles and knees could cause it to trip and topple the vehicle. AT-STs are also known to require constant maintenance, having perhaps the highest maintenance-per-hour record in the entire Imperial Army."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The modular design of the All Terrain Scout Transport allowed for ease in customizing the walker with armaments and tools for specific mission parameters. Mortar launchers were one such weapon that could be attached to the command pod of the AT-ST."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ewoks of Endor discovered that the AT-STs were vulnerable to anti-Gorax traps. Ramming logs could smash through the walker's head, destroying the cockpit. One of its other weaknesses was its susceptibility to hijacking, despite the height of the vehicle seemingly making hijacking an impossibility. A sufficiently strong force could rip the entrance hatch off the top of the walker. If commandeered, the walker's cannons could easily penetrate other AT-STs' armor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Variant models"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "AT-ST Mark III"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The AT-ST Mark IIIs were equipped with experimental armor that provided more speed and durability than that of the standard AT-ST.

It was better equipped than the Republic AT-RT."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 14 BBY, an AT-ST attacked the Stinger Mantis ship on Zeffo, but was destroyed by the Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis. The Empire used AT-STs against the Partisans led by Saw Gerrera on Kashyyyk and Kestis, who helped the rebel group during the battle to take over an imperial refinery. The AT-STs were on Ilum when the Empire started mining the world to acquire Kyber crystals. When Kestis went to the planet to find a crystal to build a new lightsaber, two AT-STs were destroyed by the Padawan during his escape from the world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Military commonly used the AT-ST in a variety of environments. After rebel leader Saw Gerrera and his Partisans took to defending the world of Jedha, AT-STs were among the reinforcements deployed to aid the planet's occupying garrison; with the ancient Holy City consumed by surface warfare, the AT-STs were fielded for urban pacification against the Partisans whenever they could fit into the city's winding and narrow streets. While accordingly impractical during the Jedha insurgency, the walkers were also fielded to try to send a message beyond their blaster fire, but the Partisans instead chose to intensify their efforts against the garrison. With the Empire retaliating in equal force, battle continued in the streets, with AT-STs devastating the city and civilians. Even so, both sides continued to fight, with one AT-ST being deployed in Tythoni Square as part of the battle on Jedha in 0 BBY. The insurgency ended when all but at least three percent of the Imperial garrison retreated under protocol 13. Afterward, the DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station destroyed the Holy City."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The walkers were also used in the Galactic Civil War. At least one fought in the Battle of Allst Prime. Between the Battle of Yavin and Battle of Hoth, the Alliance to Restore the Republic operated stolen AT-STs, and provided them to Saponza's Gang, who often fought against the walkers. Three AT-STs were deployed as part of Lieutenant-Inspector Magna Tolvan's attack on the Son-tuul Pride crime syndicate. Several fought alongside AT-ATs at the Battle of Hoth. They also notably participated in the Battle of Endor, where they were defeated by the Ewoks and their traps. The walkers were also used by the Empire in the final battle of the Galactic Civil War, the Battle of Jakku, which ended up being an overwhelming victory for the New Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 9 ABY,[source?] an AT-ST was used by looters to attack a village on the planet Sorgan. The AT-ST was destroyed in a battle between the looters and the village people led by Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin and former rebel shock trooper Cara Dune."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thirty years after the close of the Galactic Civil War, a splinter military group of the New Republic called the Resistance utilized old Imperial AT-STs in combat against the reorganized remnants of the Galactic Empire, the First Order. They possessed an orange repaint and were crested with the Resistance starbird."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The original model for the AT-ST was created by members of the Industrial Light & Magic team, and George Lucas thought it was \"neat\" and decided to include it in The Empire Strikes Back alongside the AT-AT, so the ILM model shop disassembled it and added a metal stop-motion armature.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The AT-ST model received some cosmetic changes for its extensive appearance in Return of the Jedi, thus explaining the minor differences in the models used for the two films."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
