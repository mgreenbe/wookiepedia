Most artillery pieces were stationary, fed by high-output power generators, serviced by large crews and protected within armored housing, although many examples of mobile pieces existed. Light artillery pieces, also known as heavy weapons or infantry support weapons, are not included in this category, nor are the immense planetary weapons used to attack orbiting spacecraft."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Direct fire artillery included blasters and Slugthrowers which could only hit targets within their line-of-sight. While this limited their range and what they could target, their shots generally traveled fast enough that the enemy had almost no chance to avoid getting hit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Indirect fire artillery included missiles, rockets and shells traveling on a ballistic trajectory which could hit targets outside their line-of-sight, whether behind cover or over the horizon. While this gave them superior range, the projectiles they fired were also vulnerable to being shot down by antimissile systems. As well those with guidance systems, while capable of making midflight course corrects, could be fooled by enemy countermeasures."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Imperial Army"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Overview"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Classification"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial Army classified artillery pieces in three major categories; light, medium and heavy. An artillery section would typically have a single heavy or medium artillery piece.

These squad sized units would typically consist of eight humans. The section could sometimes be further divided into two four man gun crews each using a single light artillery piece. Or alternatively work together to crew a single medium or heavy artillery piece."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Artillery line"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An artillery line would have four artillery sections. Plus a command element which consisted of commanding officer at the rank of lieutenant and a sergeant major who served executive officer which was the second-in-command of the unit.

The Logistics section was made up by eight logistics personnel, eighty eight droids and a logistics officer. The medical team consisted of four medical personnel, eight droids and a medical officer. The technical group had eleven technical personnel, twenty two droids and a technical officer.

The artillery batteries conducted fire support missions, the assault company secure ground and defend the other units, while the security platoon only defended the captain and his or her power. The argumentation process allowed the battalion to essentially double in strength."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Artillery regiment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The artillery regiment was the largest official artillery formation in the imperial army. It consisted three artillery battalions, an assault battalion, a scout troop and the traditional support and security units within the regimental headquarter. The regiment could be augmented with the addition of an repulsorlift battalion and three artillery battalions."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the formation of the Imperial Army, artillery had been given the least priority of the combat arms, with the common thinking that artillery would play no significant role on modern battlefields. The Rebellion, however, proved them wrong and attempts were made to quickly revitalize this force. Officially an artillery regiment would be attached to a battlegroup and operate as a single unit. However due to some complaints by junior officers on occasion smaller artillery units were assigned at the regimental or battalion level, such as an artillery battery being attached to a line battalion, although this was not reflected in the OB."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
