Ferroh and the Jedi were ambushed by the Mandalorians before the Fourth battle of Suurja, and they were taken to Flashpoint Station, where they were tortured by the Mandalorian scientist Demagol.

However, all the Jedi present experienced a vision of the Mandalorians murdering the Cathar.

The Galactic Republic assumed that the Cathar had migrated due to a disease, but Ferroh learned from Cathar refugees offworld that the Mandalorians, who had hated the Cathar species since the Great Sith War, had beleaguered the planet.

However, the Jedi Council urged the Jedi to be patient and strictly forbade action against the Mandalorians, feeling that the true threat had not yet emerged. Revan would not be dissuaded, however, and both he and Alek believed that the Order operated too slowly and exercised excessive caution in its decisions. Alek was the first to join Revan's movement, known as the Revanchists, and other Jedi, including Ferroh, soon followed. In the year 3964 BBY, Ferroh was among a group of Jedi that chose to take a more proactive role in the ongoing war by participating in a scouting mission along the Outer Rim, just prior to the Mandalorian invasion of Republic space. Led by Revan, Ferroh and his fellow Jedi investigated the Mandalorian threat along the Republic border against the wishes of the Jedi Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ferroh and the Revanchists were left behind on the planet Suurja while Revan departed to investigate events on Onderon and its jungle moon, Dxun. Ferroh, along with the other Jedi, was captured in an ambush before the Fourth battle of Suurja by the Mandalorians and was taken to Flashpoint Station, an old Republic research station that the Mandalorians had captured. The Jedi were tortured there by the Mandalorian scientist Demagol, who was attempting to divine the source and nature of the Jedi's Force abilities. Shortly after the Mandalorians attacked the planet Vanquo, the Mandalorian station gained another prisoner, the female Arkanian offshoot named Jarael, to whom Ferroh explained her location and how he and his fellow Jedi had been previously captured by the Mandalorians. After Alek came out of a torture session with Demagol, Ferroh and the other Jedi attempted to help him stand up, though Alek assured them that he was all right."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the fugitive Jedi Padawan Zayne Carrick and the crew of the starship Last Resort arrived on the station to rescue Jarael. Carrick pretended to be captured by the rogue Mandalorian Rohlan Dyre and was taken in Jarael's stead to be tortured by Demagol; when Dyre emerged with Demagol, actually Carrick in disguise, they announced that Carrick was dead. Shortly after this, the Mandalorians were tricked into leaving the station during a false \"Republic attack\" masterminded by the Snivvian con artist Marn Hierogryph, one of Carrick's companions. Before they left the station with the incapacitated Demagol in their custody, Ferroh managed to find Carrick's lightsaber, returning it to the Padawan. En route to the galactic capital, however, Demagol fell into a drug-induced coma and could not be awakened to stand trial for his crimes. In actuality, Demagol had awoken, drugged Rohlan Dyre, and switched armors with the Mandalorian deserter in order to travel with Jarael, Carrick, and their companions."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Vision on Cathar"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While he and the Revanchists were on the planet Cathar to investigate the truth about the massacre that had taken place there, Ferroh, Alek, Revan, and the other Jedi felt death in the Force when the Mandalorians unleashed a devastating nuclear attack on Serroco. Eventually, Alek, now going by the name \"Malak,\" returned from Coruscant after testifying against the secret organization called the Jedi Covenant on Zayne Carrick's behalf. Following Malak's return, a team of Jedi loyal to the Council, led by Jedi Master Vrook Lamar, met with Revan, Ferroh, Malak, and the Revanchists. They ordered the group to disband permanently, believing that the Mandalorians were not a threat and that nothing warranted the Jedi's involvement in the Mandalorian Wars. During the discussion, Revan noticed a Mandalorian mask underneath his own feet and picked it up."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the light struck the mask, all the Jedi experienced a vision of the past of Mandalorians driving hordes of the Cathar into the sea. A Mandalorian female, to whom the mask in Revan's hands belonged, tried to convince Cassus Fett\u2014the Mandalorian who had led the attack on the planet\u2014that the Cathar were defeated and did not all need to be killed. However, Fett refused to stand down, saying that the Cathar left a stain of dishonor amongst the Mando'ade and that he intended to wash that stain clean by committing genocide. Fett then ordered the planet's devastation, killing the Cathar and the Mandalorian female."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the vision ended, Revan became enraged, shouting that the Mandalorians' massacre of the already beaten Cathar had not been warranted. Recognizing that the lone Mandalorian female knew that the genocide had been wrong, Revan decided to take up her cause of protecting innocents from unnecessary destruction. As Ferroh, Malak, and the other Jedi watched, Revan donned the Mandalorian female's mask, vowing not to remove it until there was justice against the Mandalorians\u2014specifically, their defeat. Despite knowing the truth of what had happened on Cathar, the Jedi still did not give their full support to Revan. However, with Revan's reorganization of the Revanchists under the banner of a Republic Mercy Corps, the Jedi Council allowed Revan, Malak, Ferroh, and their like-minded comrades to participate in the Mandalorian Wars."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Reunion on Wor Tandell"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ferroh eventually went to the planet Wor Tandell, along with Malak and the Republic Captain Telettoh, to search for Zayne Carrick\u2014who had been found innocent of the crimes charged against him\u2014and his friends.

Carrick expressed his relief, stating that he had thought that Ferroh was in the Captain's custody. When Carrick expressed his disbelief to Ferroh's announcement of the Jedi's involvement in the Mandalorian Wars, Ferroh told the former Jedi of his past, and of the vision he and the Revanchists had experienced on Cathar.

Sometime after the trial ended, Malak learned that \"Demagol\" had not made it back to his holding cell, and Ferroh assisted Malak in the search for the scientist on Coruscant.

In 3964 BBY, Ferroh was among a number of Jedi who were eager to defend the Republic when the Mandalorians attacked. Ferroh was willing to defy the Jedi Council's orders during the war in the face of the Revanchists' cause by participating in a scouting mission on the Republic's behalf.

He expressed his gratitude to Carrick after the fugitive Jedi and his companions rescued him and the other captive Jedi from the Mandalorians. While he and the Revanchists were on Cathar searching for evidence of the Mandalorian atrocities, Ferroh, along with his fellow Jedi, were persistent and did not give up in their efforts to find this information. Following Malak's defeat of Demagol, who was believed to be Rohlan Dyre, Ferroh did not agree with Malak's actions when he continued to fight Demagol.
