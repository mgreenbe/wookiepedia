The bar was welded together out of scrap, shaped into a rough half circle, all of it underneath the cap-top of a 323 Rakhmann concussion-miner. Knockback Nectar, a favorite drink of humans and Uthuthma on Jakku, was sold in Ergel's Bar. By 5 ABY, Corwin Ballast was working as a bartender in the bar when Grand Admiral Rae Sloane came to Jakku seeking information about Gallius Rax. Ergel himself sometimes worked as a bartender there."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
