By the time of the Galactic Civil War, the ship had been totally converted and refitted as a pirate ship, and required only a crew of just over three hundred to operate. It was equipped with sublight and hyperdrive engines, and was armed, but not as well as an Imperial Star Destroyer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The vessel which would later be named the GrimDeath I initially served the Galactic Republic as a warship. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, the vessel was in the hands of pirates, and Imperial High Command believed that the pirates were in league with the Alliance to Restore the Republic. After conducting a series of raids in the Woldona system, the GrimDeath I headed for the planet Galpos II. A Star Destroyer tracked the vessel, waiting for the Avenger and Terminator to move in, but Imperial High Command authorized the vessel to engage the GrimDeath I as they feared the pirates might escape. The plan was for the Star Destroyer to act as a distraction; by entering the GrimDeath I's sensor range and forcing the pirate ship to turn and scan the Star Destroyer, a battle shuttle carrying Spacetrooper Platoon 243-XT would approach the GrimDeath I under cover of its engine noise. Zero-G assault stormtroopers, led by Sergeant Clayton Balrog, would then storm the ship and capture it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
