The Digital Expansion was first mentioned on February 3, 2014, in the producers' \"Road Map\" for 2014, and was described as being similar in scale to The Old Republic's first Digital Expansion, Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel. Shadow of Revan introduces two new worlds, Rishi and Yavin 4, as well as two new Flashpoints, two new Operations, and four Hard Mode Flashpoints. It focuses on the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic's joint efforts to defeat the Order of Revan and the returned Revan, whose plans affect the entire galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Gameplay"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A Digital Expansion for Star Wars: The Old Republic, Shadow of Revan is digital content that can be added onto the primary game and is only accessible to players who have purchased the Digital Expansion.

It was later hinted at during the promotion of the \"Forged Alliances\" storyline, which was stated to tie into the upcoming expansion. The short teaser entitled \"A Deadly Force Returns\" was released on September 16 and featured the returned Revan; a full announcement was expected by the end of September after a brief trailer entitled \"Revan Returns\" was released on September 16, but was delayed until October 6. As with Rise of the Hutt Cartel, Shadow of Revan will be preceded by a number of pre-order bonuses, and it will be released alongside Game Update 3.0 on December 2. The actual expansion will be released to the public on December 9, though players who pre-order Shadow of Revan prior to November 2 will receive a week of Early Access starting on December 2, in addition to an exclusive Grand Statue of Revan and the Rise of Hutt Cartel expansion for free. Players who purchase before December 1 will also receive the statue and Rise of the Hutt Cartel, and subscribers who pre-order the expansion will receive a Class Experience Boost that rewards players with a 12x boost to experience gained in class missions; the boost is effective from the moment the expansion is purchased until December 1."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
