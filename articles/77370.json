The adopted homeworld of the Koorivar species, the planet was purchased by the horned-humanoids after a lengthy legal battle with the Galactic Republic. While the planet suffered an economic crisis under the reign of the Humanocentric-biases of the Galactic Empire, Kooriva recovered and thrived under both New Republic and Galactic Alliance rule."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A tropical planet first ruled by the Rakata of the Infinite Empire circa 30,000 BBY, the planet was eventually recolonized by a homeless species of horned-humanoids who eventually took up the name Koorivar. While the Koorivar were able to maintain a hold on the planet for several millennia, the planet's indigenous population, with the help of the Galactic Republic Senate, ousted the Koorivar, forcing them to wander the stars for several hundred years. Despite these efforts, the Koorivar persevered and won enough support to buy the planet and gain representation in the Senate. Once the Koorivar had returned, the economy on the planet flourished and the Corporate Alliance grew a strong foothold on the world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet became involved in galactic-wide politics when its senator, Passel Argente, became an unwitting pawn of Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious. Argente, the Magistrate of the Corporate Alliance, led the planet away from the Republic and took a seat on the governing Council of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a separatist group which would engage in all out war with the Republic. As the Clone Wars erupted across the galaxy, the 20th Sector Army of the Grand Army of the Republic patrolled the area of space surrounding Kooriva. As the war raged, the planet eventually fell to the Republic through the efforts of Marshal Commander Cody. In the wake of the war and the rise of the Galactic Empire, Kooriva suffered an economic depression as the Empire punished the planet for its involvement with the Confederacy. Despite this setback, the world flourished under both the New Republic and Galactic Alliance. The Galactic Alliance Committee on Corporate Oversight regarded the Koorivar with suspicion and kept a wary eye on them. Having avoided the Yuuzhan Vong War, Koorivar was eventually engulfed by the Empire of Darth Krayt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
