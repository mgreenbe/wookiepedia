A convertible carbine long-barreled variation of the DD6, the DR-45 possessed a quick-release clip-on rifle housing and buttstock, which allowed the weapon to be configured from pistol to rifle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Instead of providing mounted cavalry units with a rifle and sidearm, Merr-Sonn hoped they would prefer to carry a single re-configurable weapon suitable for scouting, patrolling, and frontline combat situations. However, despite their desires, the DR-45 was rejected by local defense forces, who were unwilling to take the field without a backup weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
