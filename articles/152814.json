The fugitive clones Hunter and Echo visited his shop to sell some items for credits, but the merchant was not interested in the pyro denton explosive Hunter offered. Mistaking the disguised Echo, who was a cyborg with a scomp link arm, for a droid, the trader offered 2,000 credits. After talking with Echo, Hunter decided to take the deal as they were badly in need of money, telling Echo he could leave and make his way back to the spaceport when their unit was ready to depart. Hunter talked the merchant into paying 3,000 for the \"droid\" before leaving, and the trader put Echo in charge of his droids. When Echo did leave, taking the droids to repair his team's starship, the merchant was shocked, but Echo retorted that he had got him for a bargain."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The trader operated a shop in the central marketplace of Ro Station on Pantora. He owned several droids which he restricted to his shop's back room by means of restraining bolts: the protocol droid CG-67 was charged with supervising the astromech droids 225 and DK-3 and the LE-series droid Clink. Shortly after the formation of the Galactic Empire, the fugitive clones Hunter, Echo, and Omega visited the trader's shop. Hunter attempted to sell the merchant a pyro denton explosive, but the trader refused a sale. When Hunter argued that the explosive was worth at least 1,800 credits, the merchant suggested that he go to the black market, stating that he was attempting to run a reputable business. While the negotiations were going on, Omega looked at some dolls on display and knocked the container holding them onto the floor, prompting the trader to scold her that she would have to buy anything she broke. She put one doll back and took the other one to show Echo, who adjusted the toy while she was holding it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Echo, due to being both a fugitive clone trooper and a cyborg with extensive and conspicuous cybernetics, had donned a disguise before heading into the city which concealed all of his organic body parts, including a mask over his face. The trader thus assumed he was some kind of droid and extended Hunter an offer to purchase him for 2,000 credits. Being in desperate need of money, Hunter decided to consider the offer, telling the trader that Echo was a military prototype while his comrade was surprised to be mistaken for a droid at all. Echo became incredulous when he realized Hunter planned to go for the deal, but Hunter persuaded him to play along because they needed the credits, telling him he would contact him when their group was ready to leave so he could go. Begrudgingly, Echo agreed, but told Hunter to ask for more as he felt he was worth more than 2,000. Hunter made the trader a counteroffer of 4,000, and the two eventually settled on 3,000. While the trader was looking over the \"droid\" he had just bought, Omega wandered off into the marketplace and got lost."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The deal closed, the trader led Echo into his back room while Hunter told the \"droid\" to go along. Hunter subsequently noticed that Omega was missing and set out looking for her, while the trader put a restraining bolt on Echo and charged the \"droid\" with supervision, stating that he would finally get some order in his back room. Left alone, Echo raised his mask and was subsequently met by CG-67, but he used his blaster pistol to intimidate her into silence before she could report the deception."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hunter wound up in a fight with the bounty hunter Fennec Shand, who had been hired to seize Omega. After initially losing both Shand and Omega, he contacted his team to alert them to the situation. Informed that the team's starship was in need of a team of repair droids to get it back in working order quickly, Echo recruited the merchant's droids, removing their restraining bolts with his scomp link arm. Echo then led the droids out of the back room on their way to the hangar, casually handing the trader the removed bolts as he passed. The merchant was shocked to see that Echo was not a droid, and Echo retorted that the merchant had got him for a bargain before leaving. After the repairs were complete, Echo left the astromechs and Clink to the care of CG-67, and they headed back into the city."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The trader was a male Gran with light brown skin and brown eyes. His right eye was blind. The trader was willing to make people who damaged his wares pay for what they had done. He had no interest in explosives, being unwilling to pay nearly 2,000 credits for the explosive charge Hunter offered him. The trader also believed that CG-67's supervision skills were lacking, and saw the purchase of what he thought was a supervisor droid as a way to shape up his back room. He failed to notice that the cyborg Echo was not actually a droid until he saw him with his mask off."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The trader wore a pink-and-yellow tunic with a brown bandolier, and a close-fitting brown-and-yellow hat.
