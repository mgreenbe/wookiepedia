The holdings of various Imperial warlords had recently been unified to form the Remnant, and new Head of State Gilad Pellaeon hoped to demonstrate the Remnant's power to the New Republic without provoking too aggressive of a response. Commanding from the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Reaper and assisted by Turr Phennir and the 181st Imperial Fighter Group, Pellaeon captured Orinda and six systems coreward along the Entralla Route. Lonnaw was their final conquest. Pellaeon then sent emissaries to the New Republic and asked for the Remnant's new borders to be respected, but the New Republic instead responded with force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
