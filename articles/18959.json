It was comprised of two system bombards, two force escorts, a force technical services, and a force support, for an average of 416 starships. Bombard fleets were deployed to regions where the Galactic Empire determined that suppression of Alliance to Restore the Republic activity was less than even. They were used in instances where the Empire would rather destroy a planet than see it in the hands of the Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
