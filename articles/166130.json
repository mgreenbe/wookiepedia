They also had grenade launchers. Along with formidable armament, they sported highly advanced self-destruct mechanisms so when they were damaged beyond repair they would attempt to destroy as many enemies as possible in their last act of violence. The droids were powerful enough to destroy several strafing coralskippers during the battle in the Baanu Rass. This maximum destruction motive caused the highest compliment YVH-droids to give each other as \"Maximum Efficiency\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
