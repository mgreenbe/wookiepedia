It was reputed to be the former residence of a space-pirate. The fortress in this gorge soon became the private retreat of Darth Sidious during Maul's time at the Orsis Academy, and Maul was permitted to go there via airspeeder, to continue his training in the Force. Neither Trezza nor Maul knew how Palpatine had procured this residence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
