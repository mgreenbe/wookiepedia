Grox led a boarding party onto the freighter, consisting of him, Gorr, the Nephran Mirack, and the assassin droid PALLAS-Eleven.

Eventually, they were approached by the First Order. They wanted his gang to attack the refueling station Colossus for the them so its captain, Imanuel Doza, could give up power to the First Order for protection. The First Order gave them equipment to do this, and they began running \"Triple Dark\" attacks on the Colossus.

The Colossus defenses mobilized and Ace Squadron engaged the pirates. The pirates were able to take out at least two defense turrets regardless.

Gorr's two subordinates engaged the pair, but after Yeager knocked one of them off his hoverlift, he rammed it hoverlift into the other one, knocking them unconscious.

Yeager flew his hoverlift in for another attempt and Gorr tried to knock him off. However, the hoverlift was already flying towards the targeting computer at high speed.

Gorr dismissed Synara's concerns and chided her for becoming \"too soft\" and attached to the Colossus inhabitants.
