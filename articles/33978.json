Though Leia didn't formally break up with him, Dar didn't see his girlfriend again until the Galactic Civil War.

Following that mission, General Carlist Rieekan dispatched Leia and Han Solo to Lanz Carpo on a mission to provoke a battle between Boss Carpo and the Galactic Empire, hoping that Leia could use her past relationship with Champion as the key to accessing Carpo's Comm Center. After arriving on-world, Leia and Han were extorted by Red Carpo Guards of the Carpo Crime Syndicate, but were saved by Champion who attacked and subdued the guards. He helped Leia up as she explained that Dar had once been her boyfriend, much to Han's consternation. Following the altercation, the guards were taken away and Dar was interviewed by Banny.
