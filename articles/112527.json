Based in the Grill in Shulell City, the cell maintained a soup kitchen and was active in the smuggling network. The cell was also charged with recruiting any refugees that could be of value to the Alliance to Restore the Republic, but many of those approached refused to fight since they felt safe on Lan Barell. One of the cell leaders was Felix Habel, and the cell operated with the knowledge of the Lan Barell government, the Human-Qieg Guild. Under agreement with the Guild, no heavy weapons were to be stockpiled in the Lan system for fear of Imperial retaliation. However, several firebrands in the cell secretly established a weapons depot in the planet's Lowlands."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
