When stranded on the moon, Yrica Quell encountered this observatory and with the aid of IT-O determined that the observatory tower could only be open when it sensed a sufficient biological reading, or as Yrica figured; it was mood activated. The observatory aligned its lens with the Cerberon singularity and would make the being \"using\" it relive memories. The being needed to come to terms with their past in order to unlock it. Once unlocked, there was a starship equipped with a cloaking device stored inside. Yrica Quell used this ship to escape falling into the maw of the Cerberon black hole, which the planetoid itself was being sucked into."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
