They were stationed onboard the Liberty to recover lost supplies from the XQ5 Platform Hormuuz that was originally an Alliance base before it was abandoned and left to be taken by the Imperial Navy as part of Task Force Vengeance. Once the Rebels regrouped they returned to recover the supplies once after driving off, if not destroy the defences at the base. Once the area was clear of enemies the lifters were launched to pick up 4 Class-I cargo containers and bring them to the Liberty."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
