Growing to about a couple of meters tall, the humanoid-build Danchaf were climbing creatures that possessed clawed feet and broad shoulders protected by scales with horn-like protrusions. Xenobiologists identified the goblins as non-sentient, although the Jenet argued that the creatures' abilities in problem-solving and reasoning manifested themselves when the offworld observers were not present. This belief was heightened more by Jenet legends that told of a time when the Danchaf ruled the world and were only driven back by the warriors of the Jenet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
