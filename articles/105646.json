Meanwhile, in the capital city of Coronet, Lieutenant Joth of the Corellian Security Force became aware of rumors that the laboratory was involved in some form of illicit activity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eager to learn more, Joth employed a spacer to investigate the laboratory, and uncover more information. In the process of doing so, Joth instructed the spacer to kill Rawklin and the two other administrative heads. Despite putting up a fight with his small arsenal of carbines, Rawklin was killed, and the spacer collected from his body a passcode which was used to access and download information from his office computer. The information gleaned from the computer confirmed Lieutenant Joth's suspicions that the laboratory was being used for unsanctioned bioengineering projects on various creatures. In light of this, Joth ordered the spacer to shut down the facility."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his time as an administrative head in the Corellian laboratory, Pirt Rawklin wore a green-colored robe, underneath which he wore a muscle shirt with two shades of gray.
