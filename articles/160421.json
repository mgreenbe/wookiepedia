She was also occasionally nicknamed \"Vern,\" although she disliked it. The former Padawan of Jedi Master Stellan Gios, she was promoted to the rank of Knight at the age of fifteen, making her the youngest Jedi to hold that rank in a long time. Several months later, after turning sixteen, Rwoh's first proper Jedi mission was supervising Avon Starros, an aspiring inventor and the daughter of Senator Ghirra Starros, at the remote outpost Port Haileap. However, when Rwoh and Starros joined a party traveling on the starship Steady Wing to the Starlight Beacon, a new space station, the cruiser was bombed, leading the two of them, along with Padawan Imri Cantaros, Starros' protocol droid J-6, and Honesty Weft, the son of a Dalnan ambassador, stranded on the jungle moon Wevo after evacuating the stricken ship in a shuttle. Vernestra, although young for her rank, was devoted to the ideals of the Jedi Order and wished to help others as best she could."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vernestra Rwoh, a Mirialan female, was born around the year 248 BBY. She joined the Jedi Order at a young age, with her family group celebrating the discovery of her Force-sensitivity. She eventually became the Padawan of a human male Jedi Master, Stellan Gios. Vernestra was enough of a prodigy that she eventually attained the rank of Jedi Knight at the age of only fifteen, making her the youngest Knight in a generation."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Destruction of the Steady Wing"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A few months later, during which time she had turned sixteen, Rwoh, on her first proper assignment, was tasked with taking care of twelve-year-old aspiring inventor Avon Starros while she was at the outpost Port Haileap, under the supervision of the outpost's marshal, Jedi Master Douglas Sunvale. Although Avon's mother, Senator Ghirra Starros, had sent her daughter to the remote spaceport to get her out of trouble and to make her appreciate her life on Coruscant more, Rwoh believed that being at Port Haileap only gave Avon more opportunities to do whatever she wanted. Rwoh liked Avon Starros and found her inventions fascinating, but the two often butted heads because Starros disliked being told what not to do. Starros was accompanied by her protocol droid, J-6. While at Port Haileap, Rwoh had a dream about a new design for her lightsaber which would also allow it to become a lightwhip. After completing the modification that very night, Rwoh kept her weapon's new design secret, practicing with the whip in private and not telling either Master Sunvale or her former Master Gios."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Master Sunvale eventually requested that Starros and Rwoh join the passengers of the starship Steady Wing, which was taking a Dalnan delegation, including Ambassador Weft and his son Honesty, to the dedication ceremony of the new space station Starlight Beacon. Although Starros would not play any official role on the journey and her mother had not sent for her, Sunvale hoped that she would befriend the ambassador's son, who was the same age, and ease the Dalnans' concerns about the Galactic Republic. Rwoh also hoped that the two would become friends, as she felt that Starros needed one."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On a last walk around the port prior to departure, the young Jedi Knight caught Starros messing around with a homemade scoot speeder, catching her in midair with the Force and chiding her for not being on board. After the arrival of J-6, the three headed for the Steady Wing. As they were about to board, Rwoh suddenly had a foreboding feeling about an Aqualish mechanic who was one of several workers tinkering with the ship, but she tried to dismiss the feeling as it seemed to be nothing. After boarding the cruiser, Rwoh parted ways with Starros and J-6 prior to the vessel's departure from Port Haileap."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rwoh later met Master Sunvale and his Padawan Imri Cantaros in one of the Steady Wing's dining areas, where they would be dining with the Dalnan delegation, including the Wefts, Janex, and Starstriker. Starros arrived late with J-6, stating her dress had needed refitting, and Rwoh was struck by the sharp contrast with the girl's usual appearance. The party sat down to eat, but just as they were about to begin, the Steady Wing shook. It quickly became clear the ship was in trouble. When the room was exposed to the vacuum of space, Rwoh launched herself towards the breach in order to clear debris preventing a blast door from sealing with her lightsaber. Sunvale ordered Rwoh to lead the way as the group left the room and headed for the escape pods. However, it soon became clear that the pods were gone, even though the Steady Wing was carrying far less passengers than its full possible capacity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rwoh, Starros, J-6, Cantaros, and Honesty Weft were separated from Sunvale and the others by a closing blast door. Searching for a way to escape, the group located a hangar containing a maintenance shuttle.

Rwoh bore the markings of her family, six tiny black diamonds stacked in two rows of three tattooed on the outside corner of each eye. She was compassionate and devoted to the ways of the Jedi. Although Rwoh found her charge Avon Starros exasperating at times, she enjoyed her company and wanted to get to know her better. Rwoh's prodigious talent, which vaulted her to the rank of Knight at an unusually young age, left her in an unusual position, and she was still learning to deal with her rank. This uncertainty, however, led her to occasionally dismiss genuine threats if she sensed them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Rwoh was aware of the attractiveness of other beings, she did not feel attraction to them. As she had never experienced any of the emotions related to falling in love, she found it difficult to have conversations about them. She also disliked holo adventures that focused on overwrought romances or being present for lovers' quarrels. Sometimes she thought it was easier not to have developed those attractions the way Padawans who came of age often did."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rwoh could use telekinesis, using it to stop Avon Starros when the girl was running around Port Haileap on a scoot speeder when she was supposed to be boarding the Steady Wing.
