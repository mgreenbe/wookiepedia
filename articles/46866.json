This event was written by Archie Goodwin to account for the upcoming film, Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, in which the bounty on Solo is still in place, something that Marvel Comics had not accounted for. Thus, the attack of this bounty hunter was created as a way to inform Solo in the comics that the bounty was still on his head. When Marvel began adapting the film to comics, starting in Star Wars 39, this bounty hunter was referenced as \"the bounty hunter on Ord Mantell\" referenced in the film. C-canon sources, however, tie that information in with a different incident."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
