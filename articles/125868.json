Shortly after the rescue of Hera Syndulla by the Spectres on Lothal in 1 BBY, the Imperial Noghri assassin, Rukh, used the Sinrich optical dephaser to fight against Sabine Wren and Garazeb Orrelios. The dephaser was similar to the Holographic disguise matrix, which was invented by the Snivvian bounty hunter Sinrich."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Imperial\u2013Grysk conflict, Darth Vader noted that Rukh's cloaking device was Chiss technology.
