Fett sought out Magwit's aid because it was well-known that Magwit associated with pirates, and had served for four years as an entertainer aboard Bar-Kooda's ship, Bloodstar. Upon reappearing on Bloodstar, Magwit faced almost instant death from Bar-Kooda, who prolonged his life long enough for one last magic show - which was long enough for Boba Fett to capture the pirate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Magwit was always accompanied by a green rabbit that he would pull out of a hat using a smaller version of the mystifying hoop. The rabbit was placed in many near-death situations (along with Magwit) during Boba Fett's hunt of Bar-Kooda. However, the green rabbit survived and continued to perform with Magwit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
