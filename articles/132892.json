While Princess Leia Organa and several rebel troopers try to restrain Aphra, the Volt Cobra approaches the perimeter of the Sunspot Prison where the ship is bombarded by ion cannons. While Leia contacts the bridge, Aphra's estranged friend Sana Starros knocks Aphra out with a combat move. When Leia asks Starros why she did not transmit the clearance codes, Starros responds that she had to come down and clean her \"mess.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Volt Cobra then arrives at Sunspot Prison, a secret Rebel Alliance prison facing a star. The prison houses various enemies of the Rebellion including war criminals, Imperial spies, mercenaries, and at least two Moffs. Though Aphra is defiant, the prison warden claims that the Empire will not be able to find the prison and that it is well-defended by ion cannons and a star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Elsewhere, the masked former rebel agent Eneb Ray leads a group of mercenaries and IG-RM bodyguard and enforcer droids to assail the impregnable Sunspot prison."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Weeks later the strong-spirited Aphra holds out against Rebel Alliance Intelligence Service officers.

Aboard the Falcon, Skywalker confronts Solo about his reckless action. Luke confides that the Empire has imposed a 60,000 credit bounty on his head, which is worth more than the bounty on Solo's head."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Back at Sunspot prison, Eneb Ray and his assault force use grappling lasers to hold on to Sunspot Prison.
