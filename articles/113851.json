They were led by former Republic General Maxine Baytor who retired to the planet Tatooine after the failed coup. Other members of the group were thought to have infiltrated the Galactic Empire to provide information to the Rebellion. Sometime during the Galactic Civil War, the Empire managed to capture Maxine in a local police station on Tatooine though she was quickly freed by a group of Rebels. This prompted her to contact her old group and get the Legionnaires back together. Though they were not as youthful as they had once been, they contributed whatever they could to the growing Rebel Alliance. Maxine offered the group that rescued her a chance to meet with the legendary group after they were reformed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
