Unable to clear her mind, Ahsoka worries that the stress of conflict is finally getting to her until her visions indeed prove prophetic. Padm\u00e9 narrowly avoids death when Aurra Sing attempts to assassinate her. Together, Padm\u00e9 and Ahsoka trap the hunter, and Ahsoka discovers the true villain behind the plot to kill Padm\u00e9: the incarcerated gangster, Ziro the Hutt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Plot summary"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After her recent successful missions on Florrum and Mandalore, Ahsoka is assigned by the Jedi Council and her master to take a break from the action, a decision she accepts grudgingly. But in short order, Ahsoka begins to have disturbing dreams of the bounty hunter Aurra Sing, who threatens to come after someone close to her. The visions get more and more troubling, but Ahsoka is gradually able to discern the target: Senator Amidala."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Padm\u00e9 is preparing to attend a conference hosted by Senator Bail Organa on Alderaan, which is to address the increasing humanitarian problem of the war refugees. Ahsoka gets permission to join the entourage, but her visions are getting so intense that Ahsoka gets close to paranoia and begins to feel unsure of her ability to cope with the stress. Padm\u00e9 tries to assure her that she had felt the same sense of insecurity when she was Queen of her home planet Naboo, an encouragement which eases Ahsoka a little."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the conference begins and Padm\u00e9 makes her speech, Ahsoka's fears come true: Aurra Sing has indeed smuggled herself into the conference building and is preparing to kill Padm\u00e9. Ahsoka arrives just in time to prevent Sing from hitting Padm\u00e9 dead on target with a sniper blaster, but the senator suffers a shoulder wound and Sing manages to get away. Ahsoka devises a trap to catch the assassin by having a luxury droid, wreathed in a robe, take Padm\u00e9's place at the conference while Padm\u00e9 casts her speech through the droid via telecommunication from her quarters. Nevertheless, Sing sees through that plan and prepares to ambush Padm\u00e9. Just in time, Ahsoka senses Sing's intent and intercepts her before she can carry out her assassination attempt. Before Sing manages to wound Ahsoka, she gloats that she was sent by an old enemy of Padm\u00e9's to carry out revenge, just before Padm\u00e9 manages to surprise the bounty hunter with a hidden blaster, stunning her to be picked up by Captain Typho."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ahsoka and Padm\u00e9 return to Coruscant, where they are received by Master Yoda and Anakin.

Although Ahsoka gets only a few blurry impressions, Padm\u00e9 is able to deduce that the main culprit is Ziro the Hutt, who holds her responsible for his arrest. Ahsoka and her master visits Ziro within his cell and slyly manages to make him blab out that he is indeed behind the assassination. Satisfied, Ahsoka and Anakin leave Ziro to serve an additional term in prison, which causes the Hutt to holler vows of revenge."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leia's theme can be heard as her mother arrives on Alderaan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Credits"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
