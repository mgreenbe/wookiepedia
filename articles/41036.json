She was approximately 150 meters long, and was similar in appearance to a CR70 corvette, but with a circular bridge module. She was equipped with turbolaser and ion cannon emplacements, and a starboard docking bay that housed the crew's dropship and was capable of also holding craft as large as an SX troop shuttle. The ship was crewed by smugglers led by Captain Jula Shryne."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship is described looking similar to the Tantive IV ship concept (originally purposed to be the Millennium Falcon, yet later scrapped for resembling too closely the Eagle 1 from Space: 1999)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
