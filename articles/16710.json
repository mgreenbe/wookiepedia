At around this time, a reception was thrown for him on the planet Coruscant, and Senator Leia Organa received an invitation. Since Bevicard was a member of the Centrists faction within the Senate, Organa knew that as a member of the opposing Populists faction she had only received the invitation as a symbolic gesture, and that Bevicard would be mortified if she actually attended. Organa had her assistant Greer Sonnel send a refusal the day after receiving the invitation, making sure it was extra courteous since the senator considered Bevicard to be honest about what he was despite comparing him to a snake."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bevicard was first mentioned in Bloodline, a novel written by Claudia Gray and released in 2016."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
