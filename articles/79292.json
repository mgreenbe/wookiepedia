These landing zones were created by the Galactic Empire when they took control of the city. Finding the local spaceport inadequate to their needs, the Imperials promptly set about clearing four separate locations within the city to use as landing zones and staging areas for their operations. Since Jedha City was built on a mesa, there simply was no room to expand the spaceport, so in order to create the landing zones, the Imperials leveled the buildings that stood in their way, with no regard to the residents or businesses they displaced. Of these landing zones, LZ-Aurek was the largest one and saw the majority of Imperial military traffic to and from the Star Destroyer parked in orbit, where the Imperial stormtroopers were garrisoned. The three other sites were called LZ-Besh, LZ-Cresh and LZ-Dorn, and were smaller and more makeshift, used exclusively to resupply the stormtroopers on the ground and to load and unload the cargo vessels for their kyber crystal runs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
