Reaching Hypori in a LAAT/i gunship, the ARC troopers approached a downed Acclamator-class assault ship in which the surviving Jedi were hiding. As soon as they debarked, Captain Fordo detected three life signs and had one of his troopers check in some nearby rubble, while another checked the rafters, as the rest of the squad made their way to the life signatures. When they arrived, they were met with the sight of a wounded Jedi Master, General Ki-Adi-Mundi, duelling General Grievous. The Muunilinst 10, along with the heavy Cip-Quad gunner, wasted no time in opening fire on the cyborg general, but Grievous was able to evade their shots. The gunner's captain, reacted by having his gunship pilot blast his way into the area, and open fire on the Kaleesh. While the cyborg fled the site, Fordo's men recovered the other surviving Jedi, Aayla Secura and Shaak Ti. Before his unit departed from the crash site, the clone heavy Cip-Quad gunner was ordered to take out several B2 super battle droids that were threatening the surviving Jedi. Knowing that the torso was the weakest part of the super battle droid's construction, the ARC lieutenant wasted little ammunition, and took out the droids with ease."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Hypori, this Advanced Recon Commando heavy Cip-Quad gunner wielded a high-powered rapid-firing reciprocating quad blaster. The reciprocating quad blaster, often shortened to \"Cip-Quad\", was an experimental weapon developed during the Clone Wars by Merr-Sonn Munitions. It drew power from a power cell strapped to a soldier's back and was mounted on a specialized harness featuring microrepulsorlifts. The four barrels could be fired either one or two at a time depending on the rotation pattern selected, and were cooled on the recoil by coolant tanks located within the rig itself. The heavy Cip-Quad gunner was also outfitted with specialized Phase I clone trooper armor with an experimental Phase II AT-RT helmet, which included a heads-up display that was linked to the clone's harness, allowing him to make the best use out of his weapon. In addition, the trooper wore a skirt-like kama, a blue pauldron, a rangefinder attached to his helmet, and specialized boots with studs on the bottom. The ARC trooper's armor had blue markings, showing that he was a lieutenant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Character origins"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This Advanced Recon Commando heavy Cip-Quad gunner was created for the 21st chapter of the animated television series, Star Wars: Clone Wars, where he appeared alongside nine other ARC troopers in their rescue of a Jedi task force.
