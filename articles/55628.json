Native to the planet Gorm, most Gorm-worms were a dark shade of green, with a few being grayish. Though they were easily capable of taking down immense prey, sometimes even attacking and killing animals a large as rontos, they preferred smaller prey, like womp rats. Around 147 BBY, the Galactic Republic thought this reptilian species to be extinct. This proved wrong, however, when a senator was killed on Coruscant by a wild Gorm-worm. If raised and trained from birth, Gorm-worms could be domesticated. They formed a strong bond with their owners. The most notable case was a Gorm-worm named Skritch."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
