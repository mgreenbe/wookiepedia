The refugee ships would be full of civilians, usually with ties to the faction being attacked. The opposing force would thus hesitate or refuse to fire upon its own, allowing the fleet behind the refugee screen to approach its target unhindered. To prevent the refugee vessels from departing the formation, they were either threatened with destruction or piloted by those loyal to the fleet which utilized the screen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "During the Yuuzhan Vong War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 27 ABY, during the height of the Yuuzhan Vong War, Yuuzhan Vong warmaster Tsavong Lah used a large refugee screen to cover his approach to the New Republic capital, Coruscant. As the warmaster's fleet attacked Coruscant, the New Republic fleets defending the planet became disorganized as sections of the New Republic Defense Force refused to fire upon the refugees. This confusion aided Lah in his approach, and eventually areas of the minefield protecting Coruscant were shut down to allow the refugee ships access. The Yuuzhan Vong warmaster merely ordered the refugee vessels to begin ramming the capital's planetary shields, which soon collapsed. Once the shields had fallen, the warmaster prosecuted the land invasion of Coruscant and took the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
