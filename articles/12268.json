They were present in the galaxy by the time of the Galactic Civil War. In the year 0 BBY, several Banasthaurs visited a cantina on the planet Toprawa. The cantina, known as Al The Alchemist's, was patronized by mercenaries, gun-runners, and bounty hunters from across the galaxy, the infamous Boba Fett among them. Also present in the cantina that day was Havet Storm, a young Human boy whose grandfather had been a Jedi Knight. The patrons discovered that Storm was carrying a lightsaber, so the Banasthaurs and other bar-goers clustered around the boy, staring at him with hostile intent. Fett, who bore a grudge against the boy from a previous encounter, ordered the assorted patrons of the cantina to kill Storm, but the boy escaped."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Paul Cockburn created the Banasthaurs for his pick-a-path adventure Jedi Dawn, published by Boxtree Ltd in 1993.
