They would simulate the action of natural sweat glands, and were often used following major reconstructive plastic surgery. In addition, they would rid the body of toxins by thermally siphoning the body's fluids through microcapillary ducts. The surgeon who operated on Grammel informed him that artificial perspirators were not necessary in his case, which included the replacement of his right forearm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
