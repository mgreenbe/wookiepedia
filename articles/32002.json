It was suspended from the ceiling of the Cave of the Cr\u00e8che by a series of tubes. The Cr\u00e8che egg could be damaged by sustained fire from flamethrowers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For generations, members of the Cr\u00e8che cult devoted their lives to protecting and nurturing the egg. They believed that the egg held their unborn savior. When the egg hatched, the Cr\u00e8che believed that their savior would reward them for keeping it safe for many generations. Following Operation: Sabre Strike, the Resistance General Leia Organa dispatched the starfighter pilot Poe Dameron and his Black Squadron to search for the explorer Lor San Tekka. Leia believed that Lor San Tekka could help her find her lost brother Luke Skywalker. When Poe arrived on Ovanis, the Cr\u00e8che elder told her that Tekka had visited them a long time ago."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She then proceeded to brief Poe about the Cr\u00e8che egg and its importance to her community. When BB-8 found a tracker on Poe's T-70 X-wing starfighter, Poe confronted the Cr\u00e8che. Mistaking the tracker for a detonator, the Cr\u00e8che elder ordered her people to attack Poe. Poe managed to reassure the Cr\u00e8che that he was not a threat. Shortly later, the First Order agent Terex arrived with a contingent of stormtroopers and demanded the Cr\u00e8che hand over Poe. The Cr\u00e8che elder feigned ignorance but one of Terex's stormtroopers sensed the presence of Poe's tracker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In retaliation, Terex threatened to torch the Cr\u00e8che egg. To save the egg, Poe surrendered himself. When Poe revealed that Black Squadron was attacking Terex's forces, Terex ordered his flametroopers to torch the egg. Ultimately, the egg cracked open and released two large winged creatures, who fought each other. The black creature ultimately triumphed over the blue winged creature. After the First Order forces were defeated by the Resistance pilot Dameron and Black Squadron, the grateful Cr\u00e8che cultists regarded the black winged creature as their savior and departed with it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Cr\u00e8che egg first appeared in the 2016 comic Poe Dameron 1, written by Charles Soule and illustrated by Phil Noto."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
