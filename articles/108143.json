In it, she predicted that the next conflict with the dark side of the Force would have five key figures, ambiguously described by their allegiance, that were going to lose whatever thing was built between them. Young Raana Tey, a Togruta seer training under Krynda, eavesdropped while she was having the vision. Years later she would tell Zayne Carrick of the prophecy during their duel on Taris in the Jedi Tower, seemingly associating the Five to the Sith threat she and the other Masters of the First WatchCircle foretold in the Rogue Moon Prophecy, their own Padawans, five who would see the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order collapse between them. Carrick retorted that it may have referred to \"five traitorous evil Jedi Masters.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Both the Masters of the First WatchCircle and their Padawans were actually five, but Raana Tey, Q'Anilia, Xamar, Feln and Lucien Draay murdered their students. Zayne was Lucien's Padawan, and he escaped. Since he set out to expose the Jedi Covenant, the cabal to which they belonged, the Masters were removed from Taris and reassigned to different postings, Feln and Raana Tey died, and Xamar confessed to the Jedi Council before being killed himself by the Republic fleet. Krynda's aide Haazen then declared the prophecy to be fulfilled."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Haazen later revealed that he had been manipulating the prophecy for years.
