In 34 ABY, pirates from Kragan Gorr's gang raided a Darius G-class freighter in sector six of this asteroid field. However, the raid went disastrously wrong when a giant Kowakian ape-lizard was set loose on the starship, as it proceeded to eat most of the pirates. Shortly after, Resistance members Poe Dameron and Kazuda Xiono, flying through the asteroid field on an informal training mission, picked up the freighter's distress signal and investigated. They and their astromech droids, BB-8 and CB-23, found and rescued the sole surviving pirate, Synara San, mistaking her for one of the freighter's crew, and brought her back to Castilon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The asteroid field near Castilon first appeared in the 2018 Star Wars Resistance episode \"Signal from Sector Six.\""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
