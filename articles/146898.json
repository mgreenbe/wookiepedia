With no success in negotiating, they engage in a fist-fight, temporarily incapacitating the clones."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the warehouse, Ventress departs, reminding Ahsoka that she still has her half of the deal to hold up. As she leaves, she is attacked by a cloaked, Force-wielding assailant. She is knocked out, and the assailant takes her lightsabers and helmet. Meanwhile, Ahsoka investigates the warehouse. There, the mysterious assailant attacks her and engages her in a duel. Assuming the attacker is Ventress, Ahsoka is pushed off a platform and falls beside a crate of nano-droids as a squad of clone troopers arrive. Before she has a chance to explain, she is knocked out by a stun blast fired by Commander Wolffe."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anakin and Koon quickly arrive and see the crates of nano-droids.
