During the station's flight from the First Order, Neeku Vozo and Nenavakasa Nalor conducted some repairs in the tunnel. Nalor, having grown to like Vozo, attempted to admit to him there that she was in fact a saboteur hired by the First Order, but reconsidered. After Nalor's sabotage was uncovered and she fled the Colossus, Vozo sent Kazuda Xiono to the service tunnel to undo some of Nalor's \"repairs\" so the station could move again."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
