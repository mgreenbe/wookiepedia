Taking a very large bribe from Carnor Jax, an Imperial Guardsman, he tampered with all of the Emperor's remaining clones causing them to age much faster than was normal. In a final act of betrayal, the physician sabotaged the genetic source material making it impossible to create new clones without the defect."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In a quest to find a fresh clone body, Palpatine left Byss to try and inhabit the body of Princess Leia's newborn son Anakin. The physician was brought along. In an attempt to throw his spirit into the baby, Palpatine's spirit was trapped by Empatojayos Brand and he finally surrendered to the abyss. Seeing Palpatine finally perish at the hand of the rebels brought great guilt upon the physician. He was captured by Luke Skywalker and his fellows, and confessed his part in the conspiracy. Unbeknownst to him, an Imperial Royal Guard heard the confession and brought the news, including the treachery of Carnor Jax, to the remaining guards on Yinchorr."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some fans have identified the Emperor's physician with Sigit Ranth, but this has never been mentioned in any canonical source and is strictly fanon.
