During the Clone Wars, Eval plotted to kidnap Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Together with renowned bounty hunter Cad Bane and Obi-Wan Kenobi, disguised as Rako Hardeen, Eval escaped prison on Coruscant and made his way to Serenno and Separatist leader Count Dooku, where Eval put a group of bounty hunters to the test through his dreaded Box. After a group of them were able to outsmart him, Eval became the getaway driver for the scheme on Naboo, but his operation was thwarted by the Jedi Order. Eval was subsequently arrested by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moralo Eval developed his loathsome reputation at an early age. He heartlessly killed his mother; when apprehended by authorities, he told them he committed this crime because he was \"bored.\" Eval spent the rest of his early life as a criminal and fugitive; this gave him a sharp survival instinct, as well as technical and engineering skills. During his time on the run, Eval became deranged and developed many odd mannerisms, such as referring to himself in the third person."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The plot to kidnap Palpatine"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, a galaxy-wide war between the Galactic Republic and the breakaway Confederacy of Independent Systems, Eval plotted to kidnap the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, Sheev Palpatine. After he was captured by a police detachment on Denon, he was incarcerated in the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center on Coruscant where he befriended Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had disguised himself as the bounty hunter Rako Hardeen to verify and then stop the criminal's plan, and convinced the Jedi to help him escape with Cad Bane, a fellow inmate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After a successful escape, Moralo Eval and his accomplices stole a Republic cruiser and crash-landed it on Nal Hutta to escape pursuit. On the planet's surface, the trio re-equipped themselves at a pawnshop in the Bilbousa Bazaar before purchasing a new ship. However, after being swindled by the local fueling station, they were forced to stop at Orondia to refuel. There, Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano caught up to them, seeking to take vengeance on Kenobi's killers. Eval attempted to fly away as the Jedi ship approached, but their ship was damaged and Bane and Kenobi went out to fend off the Jedi. After they were successful, in part due to Kenobi revealing to his former apprentice that he was in disguise, the group departed for Serenno to meet with Count Dooku for the next phase of the kidnapping plot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Serenno, Eval had Bane and Kenobi participate, alongside bounty hunters Kiera Swan, Derrown, Sixtat, Jakoli, Embo, Twazzi, Onca, Sinrich and Mantu, in a series of tests within his invention, dubbed the \"Box.\" Sending the hunters into the Box to test their skills, Eval wished them luck and proceeded to operate the Box. During the tests, Kenobi proved to be very skilled and came up with the solution to all the problems presented as the less qualified hunters were dealt with by the Box's lethal traps. Count Dooku suggested that Kenobi lead the group because of his success in the Box, which greatly angered Eval."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Kenobi went to complete the final test, shooting a series of moving targets with a sniper rifle, Eval rigged the test by having more targets than charges in the sniper rifle, meaning that Kenobi would be unable to shoot all the targets and thus fail the challenge. Eval told Kenobi that despite his skill, sometimes you just had to get lucky and released the floor from under Kenobi to drop him to his death, but Cad Bane intervened by releasing a cable from his wrist gauntlets to catch Kenobi. Bane insisted that Eval kill Kenobi like a man in hand-to-hand combat and Count Dooku agreed, instructing Kenobi and Eval fight to the death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dooku made the wall push Eval over the edge into a pit to fight Kenobi. Eval held his own against Kenobi initially, using his long arms and considerable strength to toss Kenobi. As Kenobi began to gain the upper hand, Eval used his wrist-mounted controller to activate a variety of the Box's features, including moving walls, probe droids, and flamethrowers. Eventually, Kenobi defeated Eval, but let him live because he \"just wanted to do his job and get paid.\" Eval's failure resulted in Count Dooku promoting Cad Bane to be the group's leader, thus relieving Eval of command and relegating his role in the scheme to \"getaway driver.\" The surviving hunters, Embo, Derrown, Twazzi, Bane, and \"Hardeen\" began to finish the plans for the scheme alongside Dooku."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The plan to capture Chancellor Palpatine at the Festival of Light began successfully, with Derrown deactivating the shield protecting the high-profile guests, and then activating a bomb. In the confusion, the disguised Bane, with help from Eval, kidnapped the Chancellor and fled to the designated rendezvous point at the Theed plasma refinery. However, Kenobi double-crossed the bounty hunters, and instructed Skywalker and Mace Windu where the hunters had gone. The three Jedi attacked the two, preventing their escape. Freeing the Chancellor, the Jedi arrested Eval and Bane, who were both taken back into custody."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Moralo Eval was voiced by Stephen Stanton.
