Smaller and less durable than a spacer's chest, gear bags were more portable and easier to carry especially if the spacer spent a lot of time moving around spaceports looking for work. Usually made of fabric that was tear and heat resistant, gear bags could be slung over the shoulder and have enough room for clothing and a small number of personal items. If a proper bunk was not available and the bag was mostly filled with soft items, it could double as a pillow to allow the spacer a more restful sleep. During the Galactic Civil War, SoroSuub Corporation sold the Pak-It Gear Bag for fifty credits."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
