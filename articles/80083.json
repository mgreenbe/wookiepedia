Fearful for his life, Largo hid in the North Apartments, where he was found by Revan in 3956 BBY. Largo lied to Revan that he could not afford to pay Davik despite having 100 credits, an Energy Projector worth 150 credits, and a blaster on his person, plus some money and a couple of items in his footlocker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When he explained his predicament to Revan, the former Sith Lord gave Largo 200 credits so he could pay off the debt. Relieved, but also shocked that Revan would sacrifice money for a complete stranger, Largo expressed his gratitude and hurried to hand the sum off to Davik. Sure enough, the bounty was lifted promptly afterwards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When his life was endangered by a bounty on his head, Largo was reduced to abject paranoia as he hid in his apartment awaiting the moment bounty hunters discovered his location. He was a nervous wreck when Revan encountered him, pleading and groveling, and desperate enough to immediately offer money in exchange for his life. Despite this, if it became clear that a bounty hunter before him wanted him dead, he was capable of mustering the courage to fend for himself, believing that if he were to die, it would be better to do so in a fight than as a coward."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Largo possessed a single blaster pistol which he carried at his side at all times when his life was threatened by bounty hunters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon meeting the player, Largo will immediately offer to give 50 credits to convince Revan not to reveal his location to Davik.
