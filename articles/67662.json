She idolized bounty hunters like Boba Fett, and was romantically interested in Joy Iya. During the Galactic Empire's occupation of Cloud City, she had an opportunity to meet Fett at the carbon-freezing facility, but it conflicted with Iya's hope that Isabalia would join her, Recnelo Cott, and the Ugnaughts in a workers' strike. When a stormtrooper took aim at Iya and Cott, Isabalia defended them, then joined Iya."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Isabalia was a female who lived in Cloud City on Bespin for some time. She had stayed behind on Cloud City when her parents moved to Chandrila to work in the education centers. Her parents had been active in the community on Cloud City until it became clear to them that Baron Administrator Lando Calrissian was more interested in business than education. They disapproved of what they considered Isabalia's \"misguided\" lifestyle of idolizing bounty hunters, especially Boba Fett, which required hurting other beings instead of helping them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 ABY, the seventeen-year old lived alone in a room on Level 121 rented from Recnelo Cott, an Ugnaught who worked in the Tibanna gas mines and lived apart from her clan. Cott disapproved of Isabalia's attempts to become a bounty hunter. Isabalia worked jobs roughing up other beings for the Duros Elad Zhalto, owner of the Azure Den underground gambling spot. After meeting Joy Iya on a few occasions while Iya worked at the Yarith, Isabalia became romantically interested in her, though she tended to stumble over her words and get distracted by Iya's eyes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Cott and Isabalia were heading to their respective jobs one morning, they noticed newcomers on their route. Cott quietly told Isabalia that the Galactic Empire had arrived on Cloud City and stormtroopers were asking questions at the mines. At the Azure Den, Isabalia was stunned to see Boba Fett there, and tried to decide how to best time an introduction to him. While considering that, Isabalia was surprised again by Iya, who was working at the Azure Den and said she had been meaning to talk to Isabalia. As Iya dealt cards and talked to her, Isabalia forgot to pay attention to Fett. When she was called back to Zhalto's office, she realized she had missed the opportunity to meet Fett while focused on Iya."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zhalto gave her another job to convince Na'Tala to return to his employ, in part by saying he would send his droid 3-76 if she did not agree; Isabalia knew sending 3-76 meant Na'Tala would be killed. He also used her interest in being introduced to Fett and concern about her fashion by offering her new attire from Cloud Regalia, an exclusive clothing store. Though Isabalia felt guilty, she accepted. As she left the gambling den, Iya gave her a card with an invitation to \"A Change\" that evening in Sector Four."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At Cloud Regalia, Isabalia acquired an extravagant blue jumpsuit and a matching cape, which the shop droid compared to Calrissian's tastes. She then broke into Na'Tala's apartment and found that her target also had a card for that evening. When Isabalia got there, it turned out to be a meeting led by Iya to arrange a citywide work stoppage to get the attention of Calrissian and others running the city. Na'Tala was not concerned that Isabalia was sent for her. Iya came over and told Isabalia she was more than another two-bit player and Iya believed in her, making Isabalia blush. When Isabalia said she could not join Iya and her movement until she met and learned from Fett, Iya was disappointed in her and left."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Isabalia brought Na'Tala to Zhalto, and he told her to meet Fett at the carbon-freezing facility. Vibroknuckler and Relby-K23 blaster pistol secured, she headed for the facility and encountered Cott also heading there, but for the work stoppage. Cott criticized her for not joining the Cloud City workers, and Isabalia mentally debated how Cott, Iya, and her parents all seemed to see something different in her than what she saw in herself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When a stormtrooper appeared and aimed a blaster at the group, she didn't think; she exchanged fire and then beat the stormtrooper unconscious. She then offered to join Iya's work stoppage, and Iya's response gave her hope of having a lifetime together."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Isabalia had dark brown skin and black hair, which she grew longer on the right side and shaved into a buzz cut on the left. Although Zhalto complimented her work with a Gamorrean, it had left her with two scars above her eye. She was petite in height."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a Cloud City resident, she learned the Ugnaught language. At daybreak, she liked to search for the beldons floating through the sky and changing colors, which helped her to feel grounded. She wished she could clothe herself like the beldons, changing between invisibility and vibrancy, or have a signature look like Boba Fett, Aurra Sing, or Dengar. She used to admire Lando Calrissian's flash and charisma, but she grew to consider him another politician with seductive smiles and empty promises; however, she still liked his capes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Isabalia first appeared in \"Beyond the Clouds\", a short story by Lilliam Rivera that was published in the 2020 anthology From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back.
