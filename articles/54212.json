While Gev was fighting Darth Caedus, she was badly injured and captured by Caedus. After the Battle of Uroro Station, during which Gev was freed from Alliance clutches, Leia Organa Solo told Jaina that both Gev and Orade were recovering, though not on Mandalore, due to a Nanovirus targeting the Fett genome."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The images show Orade and his stepfather, Vevut.
