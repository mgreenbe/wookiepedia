Kellie gorged herself on irradiated refuse for days, causing her to grow particularly large and aggressive, and she made a nest for herself in a cave on Sky Ridge Island, where she terrorized the native Rishii until killed by an offworlder."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
