Solo's card-playing abilities eventually sees him taking the money from every gambler in the house. However, one gambler decides to make one final bet for more interesting stakes. He decides to wager a crystal which he found in the Seoul system, as well as a holomap to the system, against Solo's ship, the Millennium Falcon. Solo is skeptical of the man's story, as the popular tale is that Seoul 5 was destroyed in a cosmic war eons ago, and the only Seoularian presence is in old abandoned outposts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The man becomes angry at Solo's disbelief and tells him his story. He was an advance scout for the Galactic Empire Exploratory Division when a meteor hit his ship just as he was entering hyperspace. Upon finding the system, he landed on the fifth planet where he discovered the crystal that he now possesses. He returned to the Empire, but due to the escalating conflict of the war, he was unable to earn enough money for a return trip."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a final piece of proof that his story is true, he uses the crystal to telekinetically throw Chewbacca across the room.

The man, infuriated over his loss, draws his blaster, yelling that Solo is a cheat. Upon hearing the man's claims, and still sore about losing their money to Solo, the rest of the cantina pulls their weapons, intending to gun Solo down.

The two quickly explain that they were the ones who led the Imperials to the planet on an information gathering expedition. Upon discovering the crystals, they had learned that the devices were used by the Seoularians to power everything in their city. Unfortunately, upon making this discovery, they were mind probed by Ssssk!, who immediately informed Drezzel. The Imperials quickly took the archaeologists prisoner, planning to use the crystals for weapons development."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nu-Ar pleads with Solo to help them escape and steal the crystals from the Imperials to keep them from manipulating the crystals in such a way.

As the trio attempt to gather up the crystals, the other crystals begin to hum once again. Intrigued by the odd reaction of the crystals, Dr. Xathan demands to see what Solo has with him. Upon showing the archaeologists the crystal that he had brought with him, the two are shocked, claiming that it is the key crystal, the main crystal which powers all the others. Before they can decide what to do with it, the Imperials, led by Drezzel, flood the crystal room and open fire."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Duel and escape"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pinned down, Solo tells the two archaeologists to run back to the entrance he came in, and he begins to lay down covering fire. Before Solo can escape with the two archaeologists, Ssssk! arrives to take care of the Rebel leader.

Ssssk! collapses from the mental blow, and Solo is free to make his escape. However, before he can make his getaway, he inadvertently slams the key crystal into a slot on a Seoularian pedestal. The action floods the chamber with light, blinding the Imperials and giving Solo the time to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the action had had unintended consequences. Locked in alongside the other crystals, the crystal room's power begins to build to the breaking point. Knowing that the area is soon to explode, Solo and the archaeologists make their way out of the trap door that Solo had come in and sprint back to the Millennium Falcon. As the city begins to be filled with a large whine, the Falcon takes off, pursued by TIE fighters. Before the fighters can open fire on Solo's ship, the Seoularian city is destroyed in a massive explosion, which destroys the TIE fighters as well. As the Millennium Falcon makes its getaway, Solo claims that he hasn't seen such an explosion since he and Chewbacca \"blew away the Death Star.\" The archaeologists are saddened by the monumental loss of archaeological knowledge, but they thank Solo for the rescue, glad that at least the crystals won't be able to be used by the Imperials.
