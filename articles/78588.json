He was rumored to be a Sith sorcerer, whose targets rarely survived his assassination attempts. Sometime following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Kima Nazith, who served as both a member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the bodyguard of Pooja Naberrie, commissioned a spacer with killing Kuroosh. Nazith recommended using a thermal detonator against Kuroosh, who wielded a red-bladed lightsaber similar in design to that of Darth Vader's."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kunn Kuroosh was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to the game files, Kunn Kuroosh spawned under the generic \"lesser_prophet_of_the_dark_side\" template. As a result, his appearance was supposedly randomized under one of four possible depictions, including a male Chiss, male Nikto, female Twi'lek, and Human male. Curiously however, a known screenshot of Kunn Kuroosh exists, depicting him as a Human female. This suggests that he may have spawned under a different character template. In any case, while the canonical species of Kuroosh cannot be definitively determined in the Star Wars Legends continuity, the quest dialogue identified Kuroosh as male. The questline that involved Kuroosh was removed from the game sometime after launch."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
