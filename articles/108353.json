Led by the superdreadnaught Star of Coruscant, the fleet included ships such as the Vehement Sword and the Sendant Pride, and it was being escorted by additional Republic warships near the Hoth system when it was ambushed by the Imperial Navy. The resulting Battle of Hoth lasted for days and crossed through several star systems before reaching its peak above the planet Hoth, where most of both fleets were destroyed and the Republic's commander Colonel Laren Omas killed. Most of the prototype ships, including the Star of Coruscant, crashed to the planet's surface."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
