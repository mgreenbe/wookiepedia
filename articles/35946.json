After fleeing the scene, he was cornered on a balcony by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. After firing a few shots at Kenobi he killed himself by leaping from the balcony, instead of being captured. Before death, he spoke in the language of the people on Concordia, which led Obi-Wan to visit the moon, along with Satine Kryze, whom was also present at the bombing of the memorial.
