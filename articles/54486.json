Although Calrissian spent an hour preparing the meal in the ship's galley, his friends refused to touch his concoction, which both Skywalker and Organa thought resembled a cross between melted boot plastic and fertilizer sprinkled with pond scum. Proud of his creation, Calrissian sampled the stew himself but found to his disgust that he had used too much Boontaspice in his recipe. He then scrapped the meal and decided to eat something else."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 26 ABY, during the Yuuzhan Vong War, Skywalker and wife Mara Jade Skywalker took a brief respite from their struggles on an island beach. As Skywalker walked barefoot through the beach's sand, memories of his youth on the desert planet Tatooine filled his thoughts, and he could nearly smell the Giju stew that his Aunt Beru Lars used to make. Later during the war, in 28 ABY, Skywalker consumed a bowl of Giju stew in the presence of his wife and Cal Omas on the New Republic Fleet Command space station, shortly before Omas's election to New Republic Chief of State."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Giju stew first appeared in the May 1996 novel Shadows of the Empire, written by Steve Perry.
