The complex was comprised of two towers, one facing the north and the other situated to the south. In 22 BBY, during the Battle of Christophsis early in the Clone Wars, Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, along with their clone troopers, set up an ambush for Separatist forces in the towers. However, the plan was leaked to Separatist commander Asajj Ventress by a traitor in the ranks, forcing Kenobi, Skywalker and their men to beat a retreat from the building."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
