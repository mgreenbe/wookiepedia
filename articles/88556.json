As a Padawan, she chose to disobey the orders of the Jedi High Council and aid the Galactic Republic in its war against the invading Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders. Rising to the rank of Jedi Knight during the conflict, she served with distinction under the command of her fellow Crusaders Revan and Malak and was eventually commissioned as a General in the Republic Military. Surik played a vital role in defeating the Mandalorians during the latter stages of the conflict, but as a direct result of her controversial actions during the cataclysmic final battle, she effectively cut her connection to the Force. Afterwards, out of all those who went to war, she was the only Jedi to avoid the call of the dark side and return to the Jedi Council to be judged for her crimes. After being exiled from the Jedi Order, she wandered the periphery of known space for nearly a decade before returning to the Republic during the Dark Wars, at the height of the First Jedi Purge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Caught up in the schemes of various mysterious factions, she was swiftly drawn into the ongoing conflict and became instrumental in engineering the defeat of the Sith Triumvirate, ruled by Darth Nihilus, Darth Sion and Darth Traya. With her connection to the Force restored, Surik emerged victorious from her campaign against the Sith Lords, and immediately began a search for the long absent Jedi Revan. She eventually found Revan imprisoned on Dromund Kaas, the capital world of a Sith Empire, believed to have been destroyed over a thousand years prior. Surik joined Revan in his mission to kill the Sith Emperor, who had been plotting an invasion of the Republic for centuries. She, Revan and Lord Scourge joined forces in their common cause and attacked the Emperor. However, Scourge seemingly betrayed his Jedi allies and stabbed Surik from behind, killing her instantly. Her death helped Revan in delaying the Emperor and his plans."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Surik did not become one with the Force at the time of her death; instead, her spirit stayed with Revan and helped him to endure the horrors of his imprisonment in stasis. In the following years after her physical demise, the Jedi that she trained during her travels proved essential to the process of rebuilding the Jedi Order, in the wake of its near annihilation due to the machinations of the Sith. When the Sith Emperor finally unleashed his army against the Republic three centuries later, Surik's spirit instructed Jedi Master Oteg to dispatch a team to free Revan from his prison on Taral V. After urging Revan to fulfill his objective and destroy the Emperor, Surik disappeared. Years later, Surik later joined with the legendary Alliance Commander and many of history's greatest champions to battle the reassembling vestiges of Vitiate's essence, destroying the Emperor once and for all.

Like many pre-Jedi younglings of her day, Surik started her training as a Padawan at the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine. She was taken as an informal Padawan by the Jedi Knight Kavar. After Kavar left to fight the Mandalorians in the early skirmishes, she trained under many Masters, including Vima Sunrider, daughter of the famed Nomi Sunrider. Master Sunrider would often caution the young Surik to be mindful of her powers, especially her aptitude for severing one's connection to the Force."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Mandalorian Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders launched an invasion of the Galactic Republic, Surik had overwhelming compassion for the lives lost in the Outer Rim. Inspired by her former Master Kavar, who had fought in the early skirmishes, she soon joined the ongoing battle, and became part of the Jedi Knight Revan's faction of Jedi after being personally recruited by Malak himself. She left a prospective Padawan, Mical, without a Master."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Surik served as one of Revan's most trusted generals during the Mandalorian Wars. She would prove her skills in battle and her knowledge of warfare in many of the war's bloodiest battles and campaigns, including the second battle of Onderon's jungle moon Dxun. She also attained the rank of Jedi Knight during the war, but no knowledge is known as to how this happened."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Overseeing the final battle at the Sith planet Malachor V, she gave the order to activate the Mass Shadow Generator when it was clear that the bulk of the Republic's forces, led by Revan, would not arrive in time to engage the Mandalorian armada. She watched silently from the bridge of her command ship as the generator crushed both the Republic and Mandalorian forces caught in its destructive wake. The ensuing death and destruction, particularly that of the comrades she had led and befriended during the war caused such a substantial wound in the Force that the shock would have killed Surik had she not unconsciously, and instinctively, severed her own connection. Thereafter she was deafened to the Force's call; incapable of sensing it through the interference caused by the Force echoes of the suffering that she had inflicted and been forced to witness. The only Jedi under Revan able to turn away from the dark side after Malachor V, she was also the only Jedi to willingly return to the Jedi Temple on the Galactic Capital Coruscant and face trial for her actions\u2014and also to defend them. Malak originally wanted Revan to use his assassin droid HK-47 to eliminate Surik, but Revan, who referred to her as a Jedi \"who was already dead,\" wanted her to face the Council and show them the hypocrisy of their teachings, and so let her leave."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite an impassioned plea, the Jedi High Council decreed that because she had followed Revan to war, she was to be cast out of the Jedi Order. In defiance when they asked for the surrender of her lightsaber, she stabbed it into the center stone. After she left, the Council discussed the true nature of her exile; they feared the \"wound\" in the Force that surrounded her. Some on the Council, most notably Jedi Master Zez-Kai Ell, felt that they were punishing her not because of what she did, but because she was symbolic of the many Jedi that had fallen to the dark side over the course of history. These Council members felt that she was the perfect opportunity to examine why and how so many Jedi fall to the dark side. But more conservative Council members, such as Master Atris, felt that the Council was too lenient on Surik, fearing that she may join Revan. The Council, however, felt that the wound in the Force already left Surik dead."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Dark Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Full details of Meetra Surik's adventures in the Outer Rim are unknown, but it is known that Atris had orchestrated the Exile's return to known space. In order to trick the Sith into revealing themselves, Atris leaked her return to the galaxy and, predictably, attracted the attention of the Sith Triumvirate. Surik's return from exile into Republic space occurred in 3951 BBY, in a time where Revan had vanquished Darth Malak and the last of the Jedi were being hunted down and exterminated. The Harbinger, a Republic cruiser bound for Onderon, had been ordered by the Republic admiral Carth Onasi\u2014a veteran of the Mandalorian Wars and the Jedi Civil War\u2014to abort the planned trip and head to the Outer Rim in order to pick up Surik. It was requested she be given status as a diplomatic passenger and escorted to Telos IV, though it was made clear that she was to be given no special treatment nor to make any indications of her identity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the trip to Telos, the ship received a distress call from a low-stock freighter, claiming to be engaged in a firefight with a Sith warship. When the Harbinger arrived, they found the ship derelict; after the crew boarded the vessel they found it to be empty, save for the battered body of Sith Lord Darth Sion. The Ebon Hawk, a small freighter that once had played a major role in the Jedi Civil War, also seemingly deserted, was picked up as well. In the next few days, crew aboard the ship began to disappear; when Darth Sion finally awoke, saying that he had come for the Jedi, cloaked Sith assassins revealed themselves and slaughtered the ship's crew \"en masse.\" In the ensuing chaos, it went unnoticed that an HK-50 series assassin droid unit had drugged Surik and sealed her away. As the ship died around them, a former Jedi Master named Kreia\u2014who was the exiled Sith Lord Darth Traya\u2014found Surik, brought her back to the Ebon Hawk and attempted to flee. Unfortunately, they attracted the attention of the now fully-operational warship, which fired on the freighter, damaging it severely and nearly killing both Surik and Kreia. With the help of the utility droid T3-M4, Surik was taken care of and the Ebon Hawk was guided to the nearby Peragus Mining Facility."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Surik awoke from her torpor in the mining facility's medlab, she found Kreia unconscious. After Kreia awoke and told Surik that they had to find a way off the station, she found the facility to be completely abandoned except for malfunctioning mining droids, which attacked Surik on sight. To add to the mystery, Surik's severed Force connection slowly began to return; while searching for a way off the station she found a male scoundrel named Atton Rand, who was imprisoned within a force cage in the station's brig. After Darth Sion and a group of Sith Assassins arrived on the Harbinger intending to kill Surik, believing she was the last of the Jedi, the three escaped with T3-M4 aboard the Ebon Hawk, but not before Sion sliced off Kreia's left hand. They then traveled to Telos, since it was the only available destination in the Peragus facility's navigational charts. While being pursued by the Sith in the asteroid field around Peragus, laser fire from the hijacked warship ignited the volatile fuel within the asteroids. The resulting explosion destroyed both the facility and the planet itself, though the Ebon Hawk and the Sith on board the Harbinger were able to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Surik and her crew arrived at the massive Citadel Station in orbit around Telos IV, the Ebon Hawk and T3-M4 were stolen and brought to the Telosian surface where they were held for questioning about the Peragus explosion. After a Telosian investigation proved their innocence, they were asked by Lieutenant Dol Grenn to stay on-station until the Republic's inquiry was complete. Instead, Surik allied herself with the Ithorian Force Adept Chodo Habat, eventually gathering enough evidence to expose Jana Lorso, the executive of the Czerka outpost on the Citadel Station. After gathering the necessary evidence to bring Lorso down, and after Surik saved Habat from mercenaries hired by Czerka to kill him and his herd, he allowed Surik and her companions to use one of their shuttles to reach Telos' surface, where they were shot down by a Czerka air defense tower. An Iridonian Zabrak engineer named Bao-Dur, who had designed the Mass Shadow Generator and served under Surik at Malachor V, saw the crash and pulled the three unharmed from the wreckage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While on the surface, they learned that the Ebon Hawk had been taken to the old planetary aqueducts in the polar region of the planet. Commandeering a shuttle from an abandoned military compound, Surik and her companions traveled to the aqueducts and found Jedi Master Atris there, a former member of the Council that sentenced Surik into exile. Atris was attempting to recover lost Jedi teachings and had surrounded herself with several Echani sisters. These sisters, known as Handmaidens, had vowed not to learn the ways of the Jedi. After a heated debate over what the Jedi should have done during the Mandalorian Wars, Surik and her party left with the Ebon Hawk and T3-M4. When they left, T3-M4 revealed that he had managed to download Atris's database while being held, including a recording of Surik's trial and records of where the last five remaining Jedi Masters were hiding: Atris on Telos, Kavar on Onderon, Vrook Lamar on Dantooine, Zez-Kai Ell on Nar Shaddaa, and Lonna Vash on the Sith tombworld Korriban. Coincidentally, although Kreia believed otherwise, these were the same five Jedi on the Council that cast Surik out of the Order to become the Exile. However, Brianna was ordered by Atris to sneak aboard the Ebon Hawk and aid Surik in her mission in order to monitor her activities and in order to confirm that Surik still served the Light side of the Force. The crew, together with its newest member, went off to these worlds in search of the Jedi in an attempt to unite them against the Sith and to find the answers as to why Surik was sentenced to exile."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During her adventures, Surik met many beings who became her companions. She found many of them to be Force-sensitive, and thus she trained them in the Jedi ways. During this time the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Nihilus had sent his Shadow Hand, the Miraluka Visas Marr, to assassinate Surik. However, after a brief lightsaber duel she was able to redeem Marr, accepting her into the ship's crew and retraining her in the ways of a Jedi Sentinel. With Marr gained as an ally, Surik knew she could not hide her presence for long, however she also knew that she had an inroad into finding at least one of the Sith Lords who hunted her. Surik also helped Bao-Dur overcome his guilt over the lives lost at the Battle of Malachor V, and trained him in the ways of a Jedi Guardian. When two Twi'leks on Nar Shaddaa warned Surik about Atton Rand - saying he was a killer and not just a soldier - she approached Rand about this. Initially upset about being asked about his past, Rand however revealed his past as a soldier under the Republic during the Mandalorian Wars, and as a Sith trooper during the Jedi Civil War. He told her that he decided to leave the Sith after he killed a female Jedi, with whom he fell in love, after she showed him the Force. After Surik forgave him for killing that Jedi and welcomed his honesty, Rand asked her if she would train him to be a Jedi. Surik agreed, and began training him as a Jedi Sentinel."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "In search of the Lost Jedi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Surik endeavored to stabilize the political conditions on several planets: on Nar Shaddaa she helped the refugees who were being exploited by the Exchange criminal organization, destabilizing its operations on the moon by killing the Quarren crime lords Saquesh and Visquis.

He later admitted to her that he was the droid intended for the Telos Citadel Station. She then met with Jedi Master Zez-Kai Ell and convinced him to go to the ruins of the Dantooine Jedi Enclave. After Surik's exploits on Nar Shaddaa, she discovered that the bounty hunter Mira, who joined her party on Nar Shaddaa, was Force-sensitive, and she showed Mira how to harness the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Surik and her crew traveled to Onderon, the Ebon Hawk was attacked by one of General Vaklu's commanders, Colonel Tobin.

After completing various tasks, the Mandalorian leader on Dxun, Mandalore the Preserver, allowed Surik to take one of their shuttles to Iziz, the capital of Onderon. After gaining contact with Jedi Master Kavar in the Iziz Cantina, Tobin interrupted the meeting, forcing Kavar to flee, but not without promising to contact her when he was able. Surik and Mandalore killed Tobin's forces that attacked them in the cantina and the western square, and proceeded to leave the city. After they returned to Dxun, Mandalore joined Surik not only because he felt she need an ally against the Sith, but because he intended to look for Mandalorian clans on other worlds so that he could reunite them under \"his\" leadership. She then helped Mandalore in finding scattered clans on Nar Shaddaa and Dantooine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When she traveled to Dantooine, she met with Terena Adare, who was the Khoonda outpost's administrator. Adare granted Surik permission to search for Vrook Lamar in the Jedi Enclave's ruins.

After rescuing Lamar from being shipped to Nar Shaddaa by a band of mercenaries in the Crystal Cave, she was confronted by the mercenary leader Azkul, a veteran of the Jedi Civil War who was trained at Darth Malak's academy. Azkul asked Surik to join him and take over Khoonda; however, she refused, and he left, ordering the mercenaries accompanying him to kill her. After defeating them, she returned to Khoonda, bolstered its defenses and finalized the battle plans with the local militia leader, Zherron. She and Lamar fought in the ensuing battle, killing Azkul and his mercenaries.

Kreia sensed something stirring on Dxun, and asked Kelborn whether or not they picked up anything on their sensors. Kelborn confirmed that they had, and Surik sent three members of her crew to deal with the Sith forces at the tomb of the ancient Sith Lord Freedon Nadd.

She then assisted Talia's forces in fighting Vaklu's soldiers, killing all but four. After Vaklu ordered the four remaining troops to kill Talia, Kavar and Surik intervened, killing them and defeating Vaklu. Kreia then tried to convince her to have Talia execute Vaklu, who was unarmed at the time, claiming he was too dangerous to be left alive. Surik, while respecting her counsel, said that the decision was the queen's to make, not hers. Talia then ordered her troops to execute Vaklu, ending the Onderon Civil War.

After Kreia telepathically guided her through the Valley of the Dark Lords, she entered the abandoned Sith Academy and found that Darth Sion had killed Vash no more than an hour after they landed. Before Surik and her companions escaped the Academy, they were confronted by Sion, who told her that he studied and \"immersed\" himself in her, and that he knew of the paths she walked in exile. He said that he knew her teacher, Kreia, and of the fires that raged on Dxun while the Republic died around her. Sion further stated that she knew of war and battle, and said that he knew of Malachor. Sion said that Surik knew what it meant to be broken, and warned her that Kreia would destroy her as she had destroyed him and said that he could end her suffering at Kreia's hands before it began. With these words, Surik and her companions fought the Lord of Pain, striking him down multiple times. However, the Dark Lord would recover from the fatal injuries and keep fighting. Through the Force, Kreia informed Surik that Sion was not a beast of flesh and blood, and that it was not a battle that could be won.

There, Masters Lamar, Kavar, and Ell had formed a Council in which they would decide her fate. The Masters concluded that, through her actions at Malachor V, she had become a wound in the Force. They stated that she carried the deaths of all who died in the battle within her, and that she regained her connection to the Force by feeding on death and leeching the life energy of her companions. According to the Masters, the Sith had learned their ability to feed on the Force from her, and thus she was a threat to all living beings, and possibly the Force itself, and in time she might possess the same magnitude of power like Darth Nihilus and ultimately consume the galaxy, which wasn't true. However, they deemed it necessary that she be stripped of the Force with or without her consent; she submitted to their sentence. Having re-established her previous sentence of exile, they attempted to strip her of the Force, but before they could finish, Kreia stormed into the meeting to save Surik at the last moment. Surik, still under her stasis established by the reconvened Jedi Council, was left helpless and watched as Kreia, who revealed her identity as the former Sith Lord Darth Traya, used the Force to drain the Jedi Masters of their powers, putting them through the same suffering Surik had felt on Malachor V.

After Surik defeated Atris, the victor persuaded the fallen Jedi Master to forgive her and helped Atris see the folly of her beliefs. Atris then told Surik that Kreia had fled to Malachor V to wait for her there for a final confrontation, and confirmed her identity as one of the Lords of the Sith, one of those that had murdered the Jedi. After the duel, Brianna pledged her allegiance to Surik, renouncing her title of Last of the Handmaidens, and embracing her true name. Surik then left Atris in the Academy until her role in nearly destroying the Jedi could be judged by Surik's apprentice Mical and the new Jedi Council. Shortly thereafter, Surik participated in the Battle of Telos IV and faced off with Darth Nihilus on the bridge of his flagship Ravager to keep him from destroying Telos, which he was doing to fuel his hunger for the Force. With the assistance of Nihilus' former Sith apprentice, Visas Marr, and Mandalore the Preserver, Surik faced the Dark Lord. He proved a formidable opponent and managed to stun Surik, at which point Marr offered her life in exchange for sparing Surik's life. This distracted Nihilus long enough for Surik to recover.

It was in this moment that the battle was lost, and Lord Scourge realized that the only way to challenge the Emperor's plot against the Republic was to make it appear as though he had brought the Jedi before the Emperor as a trap for the servants of the Light.

During her exile, when she heard of the war started by Revan, she wondered if she could have been so blind or if the galaxy was so truly incomprehensible. She then retreated further into herself, forsaking all Jedi principles excluding one: no attachments. She disliked having to speak about the war, even after returning to the Republic and traveling amongst friends.

The blade found an excellent focusing crystal when Surik visited the Crystal Cave on Dantooine, where she harvested a crystal with very rare properties. The crystal responded to her, drawing on Force energy which radiated from her body and strengthening her in turn, in the way of a Force bond.

This wound was caused by the Battle of Malachor V, and was what originally blocked her connection to the Force.
