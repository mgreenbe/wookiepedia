The con artist Woetar was a member of this species, as was Arvee. They were toadlike beings with wide heads, bulbous lips, webbed digits, and brown, scaly, mottled skin covered in bumpy warts. Their coloring could serve as camouflage in some environments. They usually moved by scuttling quadrupedally, and moved slower when they held objects in their hands. Their lungs were sensitive to inhaling too much dust."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
