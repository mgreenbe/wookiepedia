A difficult weapon to use, the caster's net was essentially a weighted high strength fine-mesh net with threads of electricity-conducting material woven into the webbing. This webbing was activated by means of a trailing rope, which allowed the user to both draw the net tighter around the target, as well as to activate the net via a switch. The electrical charge was many times strong enough to completely stun and immobilize a target."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
