It traded on its stopping power, rugged durability, and customizability, and was among the heaviest and bulkiest blaster pistols in its class."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the Model 80 was lauded for its combat reliability, peacetime soldiers despised the oversized blaster pistol. Many military trainees joked about their \"standard issue Model 80 limp\" after a long forced march, where it would bounce on their hips.
