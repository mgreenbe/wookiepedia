When The Phantom Menace was released, Naboo Starfighters were unveiled to the public for the first time. Factor 5, anticipating the movie's release in 1999, programmed in the unlockable extra and released the code in conjunction with the movie. During the five months between the game's release and that of Episode I, fans of the game discovered many of the secret vehicles, but the Naboo Starfighter remained unknown due to its unusual method of unlocking. The former two vehicles became playable when a clever or witty password was entered and R2-D2's beeps affirmed it, but the Naboo Starfighter required two consecutive codes made up of seemingly random alphanumerics, and R2-D2's sounds did not play after the first code."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In PC version the Naboo Starfighter is available only through installing the Rogue Squadron Update 1.2.

At the time, Factor 5 was developing a game engine to create large terrain maps. LucasArts, pleased with earlier collaborations with the company, decided to use Factor 5's engine for its new game. The game's focus would be space combat; this direction was inspired by a level of Shadows of the Empire in which the player flies a Snowspeeder during the Battle of Hoth. Rogue Squadron and Factor 5 production manager Brett Tosti stated, \"That whole scene was actually the genesis for Rogue Squadron because everybody said, 'why don't you do a whole game like that?' So we did.\" Factor 5 initially pitched a concept to allow gamers to play through missions similar to the fans' favorite action sequences from the Star Wars films. This proposal was rejected, however. At that time, Lucasfilm Ltd. was not comfortable with video games drawing directly from the films. Factor 5 originally wanted to put Wedge Antilles as the primary player, but Howard Roffman of Lucasfilm felt players would feel more comfortable with a more important Star Wars character. Factor 5 agreed to make Luke Skywalker the protagonist."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the early stages of development, designers came across Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron, a series of comics set during the years of the original film trilogy. With these comics as a guide, Factor 5 began developing a game with a similar setting and including characters from the films flying original missions. In May 1998, a demo of the game was displayed at E3, but the game was so incomplete at the time that Tosti considered it a tech demo. It rendered a basic heightmap and an immobile AT-AT model, while TIE fighters lacking artificial intelligence flew and fired in a predetermined path. When \"playing\" the demo for audiences, Tosti followed a very specific flight path of his own to give the illusion that he was actually battling with the TIEs. Despite the demo's bare-bones presentation, response from gamers was largely positive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Factor 5 appealed to Nintendo to use the Nintendo 64's newly developed memory Expansion Pak.

The Expansion Pak is used to increase Rogue Squadron's Nintendo resolution from 320\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0240 to 640\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0480."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lucasfilm was hesitant to grant access to the Star Wars library of sound effects for the game's sound designer, Rudolph Stember. As a compromise, the company provided Stember with sounds sampled at the relatively low rate of 22\u00a0kHz, half the standard rate. Stember objected, claiming that the clips sounded worse than effects he had lifted from VHS tapes for a previous Star Wars project. The game includes voice work from several notable persons, including screen actors Olivia Hussey and Raphael Sbarge as well as voice actors Bob Bergen, Neil Ross and Terence McGovern. Instead of using Nintendo's default sound drivers, Factor 5 developed its own tool called MOsys FX Surround. The Factor 5 drivers use Nintendo 64 processors, but tax them less; advanced compression techniques were also employed.
