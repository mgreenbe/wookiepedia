Senator Farr was murdered via poison by his own aide, Lolo Purs, who had developed a grudge against him for bringing the war to Rodia. Silood, another aide to Farr, presided over the ceremonies, and the funeral was guarded by a squad of Senate Guards. Among the individuals that attended the ceremony to say goodbye to Farr were Purs and Senators Padm\u00e9 Amidala, Bail Prestor Organa, and Mon Mothma, his closest confidants; Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and Vice Chair of the Senate Mas Amedda; Duchess Satine Kryze of Mandalore and her guard; Jedi Masters Yoda and Mace Windu from the Jedi High Council; and many other senators, including Riyo Chuchi, Kin Robb, Orn Free Taa, and even his political rival, Mee Deechi. After the funeral, Silood departed for Rodia with Farr's body aboard a Consular-class cruiser."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
