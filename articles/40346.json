When Leed was kidnapped by some accomplices of Taroon, she helped Qui-Gon Jinn and Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi rescue him. Later, they went to Rutan to negotiate with King Frane where Leed should stay. Then, they tried to free Yaana, King Meenon's daughter, from Frane's oppressions. After finding Yaana, Frane wouldn't let her go if no Senali stayed on Rutan, so Drenna volunteered to do it. While on Rutan, she was attacked by seeker droids, programmed by Taroon, in order to kill some neks. When Taroon found out that Drenna was in danger, he, Jinn and Kenobi went to rescue her. Finally, she fell in love with Taroon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
