In a discussion with the Commander, Okarr implied that the possession or use of this artifact had enabled him to forestall the effects of aging-mediated decay to some degree and provided him some semblance of artificial longevity. The potency of the artifact's power was such that the Outlander observed that Okarr looked exactly the same in 3631 BBY during the height of the Galactic War as he had decades earlier."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though never explicitly confirmed as such, it is possible this relic was one of those acquired by Farel Wickes on Korriban and traded to Okarr immediately prior to the events of the Return cinematic trailer.
