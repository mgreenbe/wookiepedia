The projector increased the droid's density, allowing it to effectively anchor itself where it stood. An ultra battle droid with its density projector active was virtually impossible to knock down, even for a Jedi using the Force. However, malfunctions sometimes caused ultra battle droids to be unable to deactivate their density projectors, rendering them easy targets for Republic artillery. This design flaw made it impossible to use the otherwise exceptional droids to full effect, and Baktoid Combat Automata was unable to resolve the problem until near the end of the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
