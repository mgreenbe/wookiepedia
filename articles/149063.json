The power cell was located in the handgrip, and supplied energy to the vibrating blade for up to ten hours. Vibroblade sheaths could be modified with an optional automatic recharge unit and commonly contained diagnostic software and self-sharpening hardware. The Treppus-2 could be set to activate as soon as it was removed from its sheath, or at the press of a button on the hilt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
