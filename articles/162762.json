The War Cabinet was formed after the Keshiri woman Adari Vaal visited Alanciar and warned its inhabitants, the Alanciari, of the threat posed by the Lost Tribe of Sith, a group who lived on the continent of Keshtah to the west. By the time of the invasion of Alanciar, the War Cabinet had moved their operations to Vaal Hall, a headquarters in the city Sus'mintri. During that conflict, the Sith Lord Korsin Bentado stormed Vaal Hall with his Sith forces and slaughtered the members of the War Cabinet so that he could impersonate them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
