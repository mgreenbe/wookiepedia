Due to the nature of many older quests in Star Wars Galaxies, the species and appearance of Jespral Farandan changed each time a player performed this quest. The quest dialogue given by Bren Kingal indicated that Farandan was a male, but no mention was made of his species. Therefore, the canonical species of Farandan remains unidentified, but he could have been a Human, Twi'lek, or any other number of humanoid species. Furthermore, although not mentioned in the quest dialogue, examining Farandan revealed him to be a sharpshooter. However, it should be noted that this was primarily due to game mechanics, as a result of Farandan being placed under the randomized sharpshooter spawn template appearance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
