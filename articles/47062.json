Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, Kivas repaired the Y 4 BTL-S3 Y-wing Starfighter belonging to Luke Skywalker, a rebel who crash-landed near Tikaroo. She wanted to guide Luke to the Temple of Eedit, but Sarco Plank was more convincing. She warned Luke that Sarco was a ghoul and followed them secretly. A few days later an Imperial Sentinel-class landing craft landed in the city with eight Imperial stormtroopers and a major. They inquired of a rebel and his Y-wing and when Farnay's father told the truth they captured her and went to the Temple of Eedit. Once there Sarco and Luke killed all the Imperials and rescued her. However, Sarco wanted to kill Luke as well. She helped Luke to defeat Sarco and later they went back to Tikaroo. After the Battle of Endor, Luke Skywalker returned to Devaron to see Farnay. C-3PO mentioned that she was a \"capable young woman\" by this point."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
