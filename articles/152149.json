In 26 ABY, he held the police rank of captain and was monitoring planetary space traffic. He ordered Jedi Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade Skywalker to return to the planet Coruscant as he had instructions from the New Republic government to not let them leave. They refused to return and the captain authorized a chase by four CSF interceptors. However, Rogue Squadron interfered, causing the CSF interceptors to back off and thus allowing the Skywalkers to escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Bothan appeared in The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory II: Rebirth, a novel written by Greg Keyes and published in 2001."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
