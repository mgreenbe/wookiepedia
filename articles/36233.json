To obtain a license, the captain was required to register with the Bureau of Ships and Services as an authorized Deep Core traveler, as well as receive an Imperial Security authorization and an Imperial Intelligence clearance to ensure they had done no Rebel contracting. Serving as a Deep Core hauler was a quick way to gain or regain legitimacy, as clearance included immunity from prosecution for petty crimes. The Deep Core hauler system also served to weaken the smugglers' compact formed by Talon Karrde."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
