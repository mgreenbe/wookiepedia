When Vii met with Jet Nebula in a cantina, Potannin and his squad were stunned by the Mandalorian Dao Stryver who was here to capture Nebula. Eventually, Potannin and his squad were carried by soldiers and palace guards in Tassaa Bareesh's palace. When Larin Moxla and Jedi Knight Shigar Konshi stormed in the palace and killed the Houk guards, Potannin regained consciousness and told them what had happened after Stryver escaped. Near the main vault, Robann and his squad witnessed Konshi dueling Eldon Ax. Before they could support the Jedi, they were ambushed hex droids that climbed from the main vault.
