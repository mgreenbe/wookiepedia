Once inside his residence Meeto began viewing a hologram of a female Chagrian dancing whilst two guards were stationed outside of his door. As the slaver enjoyed the hologram, the Jedi Dass Jennir scaled the side of the building to reach Meeto, having spent the best part of an afternoon learning Meeto's name and the residence's location. Upon reaching the balcony of the room Meeto was in Jennir climbed through and threatened Meeto at blaster\u2013point, demanding the slaver tell him who bought Resa. The Chagrian gave Jennir the information he was looking for, but to prevent Meeto telling Qua he was in danger, Jennir killed Meeto. The gunfire alerted the guards who entered the room and began firing at Jennir, however the Jedi tied a rope that he brought along to the balcony and leapt off, successfully escaping the guards afterwards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meeto's residence first appeared in the comic book Dark Times 4, which was the fourth issue of both the Star Wars: Dark Times comic book series and it's first story arc, The Path to Nowhere.
