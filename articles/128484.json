It was capable of producing an audible piping noise. Around 18 BBY, the Caamasi artist, Ves Volette, experienced a memnis while on the planet Coruscant. During the experience, he heard songfish in a stream near his hamlet in Jualya Village before the village was destroyed. The memnis was a vivid memory caused by many offworld Caamasi learning of the Galactic Empire's destruction of their homeworld."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The songfish was first featured in Coruscant Nights II: Street of Shadows, a 2008 novel written by Michael Reaves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
