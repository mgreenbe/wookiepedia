The Gungan Swamp was a complex and rich primeval ecosystem made of swamplands, tidal bassins, inland seas, sloughs, rivers, grasslands, ponds, lakes, lone mountains, cliffs and craggs. The waterways and channels that composed the Gungan Swamp were constantly changing, making travel very difficult. A large number of vegetal and animal species completed this ecosystem. It included large animals such as falumpasets, fambaas, ikopis and kaadus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several wetlands composed the Gungan Swamp, including the Lianorm Swamp, the Eastern swamps, the Lasay Swamp and the Paitnnu Wetlands.
