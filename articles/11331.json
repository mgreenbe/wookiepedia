It could be recognized due to a yellow symbol on its left shoulder. It served as a much greater threat during direct combat than its counterpart, capable of creating a large explosion with its cannon attachment. Due to their limited abilities as competent commanders, they often only led small groups of droids or guarded essential locations on the battlefield. The B2-HA series featured heat exchangers on their back. They were constructed by Baktoid Combat Automata and stood at a height of 1.93 meters.[source?]"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the First Battle of Geonosis in 22 BBY, a B2-HA saw action. It swatted aside its own troops to fire at a Republic All Terrain Tactical Enforcer. Clone trooper CT-1226 targeted its heat exchangers, and the missile it fired hit a Hailfire Droid.

When Nute Gunray was being transported onboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer, Tranquility, another B2-HA series super battle droid was part of a Separatist boarding party.
