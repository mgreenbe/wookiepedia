The Bespin version was used to shoot down incoming Confederacy of Independent Systems Vulture droids and MAF gunships, until they were taken over by battle droids and used against Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptors and LAAT/is."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They were also used against the 212th Attack Battalion and the 501st Legion at the Battle of Utapau. There were two mounted at the mouth of the main hangar bay of Unlimited Projection, and were used mostly against the LAAT/i gunships that were attempting to land reinforcements and assist in taking down the battle droid forces stationed therein. Members of the 501st Legion destroyed the ones in the hangar, and Obi-Wan Kenobi destroyed two other turrets by taking out their controls."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They were also common during the Galactic Civil War both the Rebels and the Empire used AA turrets to destroy aerial vehicles.
