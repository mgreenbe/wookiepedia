Under the command of Jedi General Eeth Koth, he led the Jedi Master's unit. In 21 BBY, Lock was stationed aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Steadfast when it was attacked by General Grievous and his contingent of Separatist forces. Lock led his fellow clone troopers in an effort to repel the droid boarding party at the cruiser's airlocks. Faced with overwhelming odds, Koth ordered Lock and his troops to evacuate the vessel, much to the captain's dismay.

He was created to serve in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars, a conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. He acquired the rank of Clone Captain and was assigned to Eeth Koth's unit, under the command of Jedi General and council-member Eeth Koth. In the year 21 BBY, Lock was stationed aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Steadfast, alongside Eeth Koth and the rest of his unit. Whilst the Steadfast was in the Saleucami system, a Separatist fleet attacked the ship. Led by Supreme Commander General Grievous aboard his Recusant-class Commerce Guild destroyer, Separatist forces boarded the Steadfast using docking tubes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ensuing battle saw Lock and his clone troopers forced to defend the ship's airlocks against oncoming B2-series super battle droids. Koth contacted Lock and requested an urgent report on the situation, to which the captain replied that the number of droids was too large to counter. Koth proceeded to order Lock and his troops to evacuate the vessel in escape pods, exclaiming that he would handle Grievous on the bridge. Lock protested, stressing that the droid general's forces included BX-series droid commandos, but Koth downplayed their importance and again ordered him to evacuate. Moments later, Koth and his troops were greeted by Grievous and a squad of commando droids on the bridge. The Jedi engaged Grievous in a desperate lightsaber duel, but the latter ordered his droid escort to assist and Koth was ultimately defeated and captured."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like all clones of the human male Jango Fett, Lock stood at 1.83 meters tall.
