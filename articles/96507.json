Having become a fugitive of the regime in 2 BBY, Senator Mon Mothma broadcast holovids where she listed the Empire's crimes and encouraged viewers to fight for betterment. Around the age of seventeen, Nette watched the recordings in her apartment with Yrica Quell, another resident of the Gavana Orbital who was a year younger than Nette, the pair sitting tightly against each other. The pair became close, and Quell promised everything to Nette. They discussed joining Mon Mothma's Rebel Alliance together, and Nette convinced Quell to try."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nette soon departed from Gavana Orbital on her own to be involved with the Rebellion, leaving Quell with only a message informing the younger girl of her decision. Quell subsequently got into the Imperial Academy for Nette, becoming part of the Imperial Navy to benefit from their flight training with the intention of defecting to the Alliance next. However, Quell ultimately chose to remain with the Empire until two weeks following the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, when she deserted for the Rebellion's successor, the New Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In a conversation with New Republic pilot Nath Tensent, Quell spoke of how Nette had convinced her that serving in the Alliance was the most worthwhile act one could do.

In the wake of that experience, she spoke with the IT-O Interrogation Unit IT-O, a colleague of hers with whom she had been stranded following the crash of their freighter, about her relationship with Nette, as well as how the latter had left for the Rebellion without telling her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A female individual with a crooked jawline, Nette grew close with Yrica Quell as teenagers on Gavana Orbital, the two embracing while sat watching holovids.
