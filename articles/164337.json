The character did not make the cut of the final film of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, but appeared in deleted scenes and appeared in a number of Star Wars Legends stories, variously as Windom Marstrap and Windy Starkiller. The character also appears in Star Wars LINE Webtoon, but the Webtoon comic falls into a canon \"grey area\" as the comic was allowed to have cultural interpretation. The events of the comic were referenced in the 2018 reference book Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary, New Edition, but says that Luke was aged twelve, whereas the comic states he was thirteen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
