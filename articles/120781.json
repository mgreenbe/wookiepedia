In 32 BBY, he sent an underling to steal Anakin Skywalker's plasma ignition capacitor just minutes before the Boonta Eve Classic podrace began. Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn chased the underling back to the scavenger. Refusing to return the capacitor, he challenged Jinn to take it from him, and was killed in a firefight with the Jedi Master, who returned the stolen part to Skywalker in time for the race."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The scavenger appears in 1999's Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace video game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
