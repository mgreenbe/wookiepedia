It was on Ebenmal that a battle between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance was fought sometime between the years 2 and 1 BBY. The ancient citadel of Ebenmal, which was said to have never fallen to an invader for over ten thousand years, was attacked by eighty-five Imperial jumptroopers, who brought chaos and disarray. In one hour's time, 3,000 Rebels surrendered.
