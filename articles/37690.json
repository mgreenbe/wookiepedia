Vader quickly dispatched a TIE/br boarding shuttle filled with the troops of the 501st Legion, and boarded the Tantive IV. Later the crew of the Devastator attached a portable accessway to the corvette. The Devastator also targeted and destroyed any escape pods that were launched in order to ensure none of the Rebels escaped. The sole exception was R2-D2 and C-3PO's escape pod\u2014which even then was only because they didn't detect any life signs in the pod, and dismissed it as a malfunction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During those events, Blue Squadron of the Anchorhead Base moved to intercept it.
