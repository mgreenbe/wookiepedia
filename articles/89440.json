It was a flying wing design, and was extremely heavily armed with 48 laser cannons. The lasers were mounted in dual turrets, with half on the top and half on the bottom of the aircraft. Each turret was capable of full 360 degree rotation and 90 degree elevation, allowing the gunners to engage any target they could see. In addition to shooting down enemy fighters, this heavy armament was very effective at stopping incoming missiles. Meteor-class Aerial Forts were an essential part of the anti-Cartann coalition forces during the brief Adumari Civil War. Cartann's own Meteors were destroyed on the ground in the opening attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
