Eventually, the ghost of Ben Kenobi appears to Luke and tells him to turn the Force on himself. Luke obeys, and the hallucinations disintegrate to show Reist perched on Luke's chest. Skywalker activates his lightsaber and cuts the demon off his chest. At the same time, Altin Wuho arrives on the planet to retrieve his pet. He shoots Luke's blaster out of his hand, and Luke dives for cover. Just then, Reist reveals himself to be sentient and with his dying breath, he reveals to Luke that Wuho is a droid as a final revenge on his cruel master. Luke throws his lightsaber into the droid's chest, deactivating him. Luke uses parts from the destroyed droid to repair his crashed X-wing and departs from Lapez 3."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
