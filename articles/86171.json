A unit of the larger Mandalorian Guard, the Patrol acted as a Planetary Security Force, intercepting smugglers and other suspicious craft. Over time, the members of the Mandalorian Patrol developed a more aggressive reputation than their contemporaries among the ranks of the Mandalorian Guard, and were known to make use of deadly force if the situation required it. The Patrol possessed few capital ships, and though they employed a number of heavy cruisers in the course of their operations, Patrolmen more commonly relied on smaller, faster patrol craft, supported by corvettes and frigates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the intersocietal struggle between the competing ideologies of the traditional True Mandalorians, the pacifistic New Mandalorians, and the radical Death Watch, the Mandalorian Patrol was known to contain several members who sympathized with the Death Watch's cause. In his training manifesto entitled Ba'jurne Kyr'tsad Mando'ad, Death Watch leader Tor Vizsla instructed his soldiers to avoid confrontation with the Patrol. Death Watch had become adept at learning the routes and maneuvers of the Mandalorian Patrol, allowing the two organizations to keep out of each other's way, and Patrolmen with Death Watch sympathies were seen as promising candidates for potential recruitment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several decades later, the forces of the Galactic Empire occupied Mandalore and enslaved its people. After a lengthy struggle, Mand'alor Fenn Shysa and the Mandalorian Protectors finally succeeded in driving the Imperial forces from their homeworld after the Battle of Endor. From that point on, the Mandalorian Protectors' fleet of Pursuer-class ships assumed many of the duties previously performed by the Mandalorian Patrol. The Protectors patrolled Mandalorian space, attacking and boarding any hostile vessels that ventured into their territory, before delivering the captive starship to Mandalore's spaceport in the capital city of Keldabe."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mandalorian Patrol was first introduced to the Star Wars universe in The Bounty Hunter Code: From the Files of Boba Fett, a reference book co-authored by Jason Fry, Daniel Wallace, and Ryder Windham, and released on October 15, 2013."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
