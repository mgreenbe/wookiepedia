In 27 ABY, members of Wraith Squadron and the Jedi Order used such pods to enter Coruscant during their mission undetected. The pods burnt during their descent, giving them the appearance of falling meteors. Kell Tainer considered them to be 'pretty new'. They were not airtight, however, and required the members to wear vac suits. Their pods consisted of devices mounted inside hollowed-out Coralskippers. The devices had an ablative heat shield on the bottom, and a simple repulsor unit and power cell near the top to keep the pods correctly angled towards the planet's surface."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
