One of the events is a competition among the children of the Lost Tribe of Sith, which was stranded on the planet five thousand years earlier, to own a baby uvak\u2014a winged reptilian creature that, once grown, could be used for transportation. Vestara, who is at Presentation specifically for this, takes a seat in the pen where the competition will be held and waits. When the event starts about fifteen minutes later, an incubation droid rolls into the ring, deposits twelve uvak eggs in the center, and then exits the competition area."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The children, including Vestara, immediately begin attempting to force their will on the about-to-hatch uvaks through the dark side of the Force, the goal being to cause the uvak to \"imprint\" upon the competitor, thus claiming the uvak for their own. Vestara selects one of the eggs and focuses on it as the uvak inside emerges, quickly naming it Tikk due to the clicking sound it makes with its beak. However, another youth, the Keshiri Ahri Raas, picks the same uvak, and Vestara mentally battles with him over it. Raas begins to inflict pain on Tikk through the Force, and Vestara, angry at this, looks at Raas, imploring him to stop hurting the baby uvak. Startled, the Keshiri boy loses control of Tikk, who imprints upon Vestara. She gathers Tikk into her arms, and the hungry uvak nibbles her ear. Gavar, looking on from the spectator area, applauds his daughter's success."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Development"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Imprint\" is a tie-in to the Fate of the Jedi novel series in the form of a seven-page short story.
