Ben was born amidst the turmoil of the devastating Yuuzhan Vong War, where an extra-galactic species known as the Yuuzhan Vong invaded the galaxy, laying waste to dozens of worlds. As both of his parents were Jedi, they were unable to spend time with him as they fought in the war, so Skywalker was taken care of by his aunt and uncle, former Rebel heroes Han and Leia Solo. He was subsequently moved to the Shelter in the Maw, where many other young Jedi apprentices stayed. The Yuuzhan Vong were eventually repelled and a ceasefire was negotiated, but young Skywalker felt the pain of war through the Force, overwhelming him and causing him to close himself off from the Force for several years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 35 ABY, Skywalker, now eight years old, became involved in another galactic crisis.

However, Ben's parents discovered the Killik's plan and captured it. During this time, Skywalker was taken under the wing of his cousin Jacen Solo, who became his informal Jedi Master. Solo, who had just returned to the New Jedi Order after a five-year journey to learn more about the Force, was able to help Skywalker open himself up to the Force gradually, as Skywalker was still apprehensive about the Force and needed years to become fully adjusted to the Force.

The GAG controversially began interning Corellians on Coruscant, an action which greatly worried his parents. Skywalker was increasingly used on violent missions, including the assassination of Corellian politician Dur Gejjen. Meanwhile, Jacen Solo had fallen to the dark side of the Force under the tutelage of Sith Lady Lumiya, taking the Sith name Darth Caedus. Caedus eventually took over the Galactic Alliance before killing Mara Jade Skywalker. Skywalker correctly believed that Caedus was the killer and attempted to kill Caedus several times, including in a heated battle over Kashyyyk.

During this alliance, Ben formed a close relationship with the young Sith apprentice Vestara Khai. Eventually, the Sith betrayed their Jedi allies, though Ben and Luke were able to escape and defeat Abeloth, ending the psychosis. Subsequently, Ben and Luke stayed behind with a few Sith to learn more about Abeloth's origins. After further exploration of Abeloth's planet, Ben, Luke, and Vestara faced off against Abeloth and the Sith once again on Pydyr, severing the alliance as the Skywalkers and Vestara continued their hunt for Abeloth.

In the message, Solo gave Skywalker a mission: go to Almania's moon Drewwa and retrieve an artifact called the Amulet of Kalara, which was in a display case in the Almanian planetary offices of the Tendrando Arms arms company. According to Solo, the Amulet of Kalara, when activated, would make the being using it invisible in the Force. Evidently, Dorvald was working together with Solo and would also assist Skywalker in getting out of the Jedi Temple inconspicuously.

Hungry and without funds, Skywalker resorted to stealing money from a bystander and using it to purchase his food, despite his reservations about thievery. Having had his meal, Skywalker set out for the Crossroutes Business Habitat, a large office building where Tendrando Arms rented several floors. The Amulet was on the 215th floor, and wanting to obtain the artifact unobserved, Skywalker took the building's turbolift to the 216th floor, which was owned by a consulting firm called Lyster Innovations.

From there, they would bring Skywalker to Isolder's personal starcutter, the Beam Racer. However, Skywalker heard a droid on the hull of the ship after they had taken off. A usage of the hull scrubber failed to destroy the droid, and Skywalker went extravehicular onto the hull to investigate. What he found was SD-XX, who had evidently followed him to Nova Station.
