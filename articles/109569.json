Seeking inspiration, Quarrie convinced Rowan and the B1-series battle droid Roger to travel with him to the city of Alistan Nor to get a sense of style and craftsmanship. After climbing to the top of the Tower of Alistan Nor, Rowan experienced another Force vision about the Arrowhead and gained clarity on how to build the starship. Despite being attacked by the Imperial hunter droid M-OC, Rowan and his friends managed to escape back to the Alliance Fleet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After returning to the Rebel Alliance's flagship Home One, Rowan enlisted the help of his older brother Zander and sister Kordi Freemaker in obtaining the parts to build the Arrowhead. After consulting with Quarrie, the Freemakers were tasked with gathering several items including embersteel blades, a Farium fusion conduit, a proton suspension housing, an energy matrix activator, and a bantha\u2013sized Kyber crystal.

She and her family traveled to Mygeeto disguised as the Clawdite Princess Alo Kortessi of Zolan. However, the mission was complicated when Zander bid 30,000 credits on an Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor, leaving them with insufficient funds to buy the shuttle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Freemakers encountered another problem when their old enemy Graballa the Hutt kidnapped Kordi after his henchmen Baash and Raam accidentally bid for the Theta-class shuttle.

Rowan and Zander mounted a rescue mission and managed to fight Graballa's bounty hunters, who flew starfighters. Meanwhile, Kordi managed to charm her way out of captivity and drive a wedge between Graballa and his underlings.

First, Roger was attacked by a group of Ranats who wanted to steal his datapad. Second, Furlac reported the Freemakers to the Hutt crime lord Graballa, who wanted to collect an Imperial bounty on Rowan's head and obtain more kyber crystals. The Freemakers were captured by Graballa and his bounty hunters Dengar, IG-88, Bossk, Zuckuss, and 4-LOM. Graballa informed Darth Vader about Rowan's capture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite their predicament, the Freemakers managed to escape when Kordi managed to sow discord between the droid and organic bounty hunters.
