In 5 ABY, the New Republic forces were too preoccupied with their fight against the Galactic Empire to divert any military forces to support the Nagai and the Mandalorians in their campaign against the Tofs. That changed after a Tof assassin attempted to kill Leia Organa on Noquivzor, in the Colonies. Admitting that the Tof threat was real, the New Republic finally agreed to divert some of its military forces to fight the Tofs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Domina Tagge allied herself with the Tof resistance. The Tofs funded her mission to retrieve the Great Life Jewels, two red gems that could create a fatal disease known as the Crimson Forever if they were separated. Both Tagge and the Tof resistance wanted to use the gems' deadly powers in order to destroy the New Republic. Their plans were eventually foiled by a New Republic team sent to recover the Great Life Jewels, which had been stored aboard a derelict Imperial-class Star Destroyer set adrift in the Unknown Regions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
