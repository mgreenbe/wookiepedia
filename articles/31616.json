The Kanjiklub arrived in the freighter's airlock shortly after the Guavian Death Gang, who Solo also owed money, and the smuggler found himself trapped between the two groups. As Leech and Bala-Tik, frontman for the Death Squad, argued with Solo, the scavenger Rey and the former stormtrooper Finn, who Solo had recently brought aboard, accidentally released three rathtars that were being kept on the ship. The creatures immediately attacked the two criminal groups, and in the ensuing chaos, Shand was eaten by the rathars along with all of his comrades, while Solo and his companions managed to escape the creatures on board the Millennium Falcon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a hard-bitten member of the Kanjiklub gang, Crokind Shand was a human male who wore an eyepatch and a cybernetic right leg rigged to deliver fierce kicks.
