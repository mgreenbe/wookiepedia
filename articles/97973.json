However, near to the end of the war, he fell to the dark side of the Force while fighting the Separatists. Shortly afterward, he narrowly avoided death during Order 66\u2014the directive issued by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to the Republic's clone troopers to eliminate all Jedi. Nolor became a fugitive and was hunted down by some of the earliest members of the Inquisitorius, an order of Dark Jedi and Dark Side Adepts who served the newly-formed Galactic Empire. They saw his potential to be a member of their order, so they persuaded Nolor to join them and serve the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After being molded by the Inquisitorius into an adept interrogator, Nolor was assigned to become part of the Sarlacc Project, an Imperial effort to build a Super Star Destroyer prototype. He, along with other members of the Inquisitorius, worked at the administrative base for the project, Imeici Spire, a recently-constructed tower located in the CoCo Town district of Coruscant. Using his Force-aided interrogation skills, Nolor would extract knowledge from the minds of starship designers held captive there, and this information would be used to formulate designs for the gigantic prototype."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In circa 17 BBY, the anti-Imperial Alderaanian Resistance group sent a team of agents to Coruscant to determine where the Sarlacc Project was based. They broke into Imeici Spire, and, after their security breach was detected by the Imperials, Nolor was sent to deal with them. Along with two apprentice Inquisitors and two Coruscant Guards\u2014members of an elite stormtrooper division\u2014Nolor confronted the Alderaanians on Level 188 of the tower, an area still under construction. While the apprentice Inquisitors and Coruscant Guards arrived on the level using service lifts, Nolor approached the Alderaanians from a stairway. He began attacking them by hurling a large object at them with the Force, while at the same time using the Force to choke one of them. However, Nolor was eventually defeated and killed, and Imeici Spire was destroyed after its self-destruct sequence was initiated during the fight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nolor was covered in scars from the battles he had fought in. As an Inquisitor, he wore black robes that were trimmed with crimson, with no cape or hood, allowing his scars to be easily seen. He was armed with a red-bladed lightsaber that he had built himself, although he also carried a blaster. He was a skilled interrogator and this made him ideally suited to the job of extracting information from the minds of the Sarlacc Project designers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When in combat, Nolor tried to use his skills in Force-guided interrogation to give him an advantage over those he was fighting. Another favored tactic of his was to use a mind trick on one target, while simultaneously using his telekinesis abilities to hurl small objects at another. He also knew how to use the Force to choke people and how to call upon the dark side to enhance his Force powers temporarily. Nolor was multilingual, and, in addition to Basic, he could also speak Bocce and Huttese."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nolor was created by writer Sterling Hershey and made his first and only appearance in The Core of Corruption, the sixth scenario in the Dawn of Defiance campaign, a Wizards of the Coast online supplement to the Star Wars Roleplaying Game. In the supplement, the Alderaanian agents are player characters and their fight with Nolor can be resolved in a number of ways. When Nolor first enters the fight, the object he throws at the group is either a large beam or a metal plate. If Nolor is the last Inquisitor left standing, he then fights to the death, and just as he is about to be defeated, he triggers the tower's self-destruct sequence. Even if the players do not kill him, he dies when the tower collapses. It is also possible for the players to capture him, but if they do so, the self-destruct sequence is initiated by one of the other Inquisitors, and Nolor is still killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
