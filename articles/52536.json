The squad disabled the defenses surrounding the facility's command center, but were unable to enter it because their explosives weren't powerful enough to destroy the center's blast doors. Instead Gamma Two and Gamma Five tried to slice into the doors, while Gamma One and the other commandos covered them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Five minutes later, a large number of droids emerged from nearby corridors and attacked the commandos. However, Gamma One soon dealt with the threat they posed, by destroying all of the droids with a grenade. Two and Five then finally got the doors open, and Five used the installation's communications system to send out a coded signal that placed all of the droids ever built in the facility under covert control. With their objective achieved, Gamma One ordered the other clones to return to their transport, while he placed a timed explosive on the installation's power generator. He then activated the timer and ran to the transport."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
