A person could request an order to reveal against any of the Senators of the Republic. It required several complicated steps, including signatures, petitions, approvals and seals, before it was approved. Once done, then the person requesting the order could read the files of the chosen Senator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 26 BBY, Obi-Wan Kenobi and his friend, the Svivreni bureaucrat Tyro Caladian, filed one of those on Senator Sano Sauro, whom they believe was committing several crimes.
