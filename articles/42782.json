Steris were socio-economic units of Adnerem that lived together although not necessarily sharing any genetic relations. Education steri specialized in raising young Adnerem from the age of six up until they were fourteen. Prior to the age of six Adnerem were raised in the steris they were born into, although not just by their parents but various sterisi. At fourteen Adnerem would leave the education-steris and join another steris where they'd usually remain for the rest of their lives, with most rejoining their birth steris due to financial incentives offered."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
