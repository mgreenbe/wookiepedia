A compact ship with a narrow viewport, the YT Dart fit between the front mandibles of the YT-1300, seemingly extending its prow and giving it a sleeker appearance. When Lando Calrissian owned the Millennium Falcon, he had an YT Dart modified into a maneuvrable two-passenger life pod by sealing its viewport and installing both a hyperdrive and a more powerful sublight engine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
