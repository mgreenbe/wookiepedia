It could often hit multiple targets or eliminate one target with a single blast. However, its damage decreased as range to the target increased, since the pellets scattered if fired from too far away; this made the weapon more suited for close-quarters combat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The scatter gun was common on backwater worlds where slugthrowers were still the predominant weapon of choice. The gun was cheap and so was its ammunition; 10 shells each cost 2 credits and weighed 0.1 kilograms. Its low manufacturing cost and utility as a hunting weapon helped maintain its popularity. Mercenaries, marines, and other soldiers sometimes carried a scatter gun as a backup weapon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A variant of this kind of slugthrower was the A-52 Frag Storm scattergun, a gun produced during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
