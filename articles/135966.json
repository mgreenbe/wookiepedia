To make the prank believable, Loran created a false entry on the Night Caller's encyclopedia records for the Crystal Deceiver, stating that it was a dangerous predator with venomous fangs. Tainer built a small machine that made a scratching noise, and it was put in Thri'ag's quarters while he was sleeping. After walking around trying to find the insect, Thri'ag ran into the machine and fainted in fear."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
