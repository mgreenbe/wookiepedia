He managed to become an important and powerful figure in the Imperial regime by taking control of sectors which were on the verge of joining the Rebellion and bringing them back into the fold of the Empire. He once made a surprise visit to the Cynestra Space Craft Show when he discovered that Tay Industries were revealing their new D-Wing Space Superiority Fighter to see for himself if he could use it in his fight against the Rebellion. Unfortunately for him, a group of Rebels were also present who had planned on stealing the D-wing. After learning of Torith's appearance, however, their plans changed to involve killing him also. This plan succeeded, and the Rebels made off with the D-wing prototype, leaving behind the dead form of Grand Moff Torith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
