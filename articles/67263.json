The vessel was over one-thousand meters in length, and was equipped with tensor fields to keep its hull from separating, and for defensive purposes, the dreadnought sported powerful deflector shield generators that could prevent access to its main hangar and bristled with fourteen quad turbolaser cannons, thirty-four dual laser cannons, twelve point-defense ion cannons, two heavy ion cannons, several flak guns, 102 proton torpedo launchers, and tractor beam projectors, and its hull was painted a light blue-gray, with subtle yellow stripes along its bow."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sporting a large hangar for complement, the Invisible Hand could carry up to twenty squadrons of droid starfighters, several hundred vehicles for ground assault, which included IG-227 Hailfire-class droid tanks stowed away in a large corridor, and several different battle droids, including B1-series battle droids, B2-series super battle droids, droidekas, the personal IG-100 MagnaGuards of General Grievous and OOM-series security droids which patrolled the vessel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For propulsion, the Invisible Hand was equipped with a Class 1 hyperdrive generator and three Nubian Creveld-4 radial ion drives, all three of which had emergency booster engines to return the ship to level."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After losing the Malevolence in the Battle of the Kaliida Nebula, General Grievous took the Invisible Hand as his new flagship after demanding control of the starship from Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray, who had owned the craft. While the Invisible Hand served as the flagship of the Separatist navy, the Federation captain and bridge crew were allowed to remain, but were assisted by droids."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Towards the end of the Clone Wars in 19 BBY, Grievous used the Invisible Hand in several skirmishes, but he was eventually ordered to attack the Galactic Republic's capital, the Core World of Coruscant. During the battle, Grievous captured Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine and brought him to the warship. However, Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker boarded the vessel to rescue Palpatine, and Skywalker killed Count Dooku (secretly the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus), who had been holding the Chancellor hostage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unbeknownst to them, the entire event had been orchestrated by Palpatine, who was secretly Darth Sidious. The group was captured and escorted to the bridge of the Invisible Hand, where they were confronted by Grievous. Grievous intended to slay them, but ultimately could only escape, attempting to sabotage the ship and jettisoning the vessel's escape pods and eventually being picked up by the Profusion. The crippled cruiser then descended into Coruscant's atmosphere, rupturing and splitting in two at a point just to the fore of the hangar deck due to the stresses of atmospheric re-entry. Using the ship's drag fins, Skywalker was able to pilot the remaining half of the cruiser into some semblance of a landing on the surface, but the catastrophic damage it sustained meant it would likely never fly again."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Invisible Hand first appeared in Labyrinth of Evil, a direct prequel novel to Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. The events of this book are, however, now considered part of the continuity of Star Wars Legends and not official canon.
