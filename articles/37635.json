Entering the Alliance Starfighter Corps, he began training as a starfighter pilot. Before beginning combat training, pilots were required to display their basic flight skills by completing the pilot proving grounds, commonly referred to as \"The Maze,\" a series of platforms containing gates that needed to be passed through in sequence. On his first run through the course, Dev easily passed the first six gates, but as he banked his T-65 X-wing starfighter toward the next gate, the rookie accidentally made the jump through hyperspace to the Senex system, emerging in an Imperial training ground."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thinking that the Imperial ships were part of the course, Dev opened fire on the stationary Imperial TIE fighters and Class-A cargo containers, as well as a Delta-class DX-9 stormtrooper transport and the BFF-1 bulk freighter Rouh.
