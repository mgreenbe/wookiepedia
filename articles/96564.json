During the fitting of the appendage, the host was placed inside a bacta tank, and the neuron jacks were grown to match the recipient. The artificial limb grew the necessary neuron jacks, running countless checks for signs of rejection by the host. Microchanges to the neuron jacks were made constantly to ensure the prosthetic was accepted by the host."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
