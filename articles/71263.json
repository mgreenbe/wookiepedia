Nu returned to Coruscant with her droid Beetoo aboard a golden-plated Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor during the early stages of the Great Jedi Purge in search of a holocron with the list of every Force-sensitive child catalogued prior to Order 66. As a result of her return to Coruscant, Nu was killed by Darth Vader, precluding her from training new Jedi and rebuilding the Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years later, Gar, who had felt incapable of defending the enclave as a consequence of old age, detonated its entrance, burying the school along with himself. The school was later discovered by the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, Vader's son, who was seeking to restore the Order. Sometime after, while exploring an old Jedi outpost on Elphrona with his nephew Ben Solo and Lor San Tekka, Skywalker remarked that the collection of Jedi items there could be even better than those stored in Nu's school."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jocasta Nu's cache first appeared in Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 6, a 2017 canon comic written by Charles Soule and pencilled by Giuseppe Camuncoli."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
