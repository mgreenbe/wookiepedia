The piece is composed by John Williams, and opens on an interval of a major sixth, which becomes significant in the prequel trilogy, when the love theme for Anakin Skywalker and Padm\u00e9 Amidala, \"Across the Stars,\" in contrast begins on an interval of a minor sixth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The theme's first appearance is in A New Hope. It is first heard when Princess Leia is captured by Darth Vader. Later, it plays as R2-D2 plays her holographic message to Obi-Wan Kenobi. It is also heard very fully as Leia nostalgically remembers the innocent past. Strangely the theme plays when Obi-Wan Kenobi is killed by Darth Vader, even though Leia is not directly involved in this event. Finally, it plays in the end credits of A New Hope."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In The Empire Strikes Back, the theme is again present and is also developed in the new theme \"Han Solo and the Princess,\" which acts as the film's love theme. \"Princess Leia's Theme\" plays as Han Solo tells Leia that he must leave to settle his debt with Jabba the Hutt. The only other time it plays is at the end of the movie, when Leia and Lando Calrissian rescue Luke Skywalker from Bespin's Cloud City, and Leia and Luke are reunited."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Return of the Jedi, the theme is heard first as Obi-Wan and Luke discuss her while on the planet Dagobah, shortly after Yoda's death.

Its first occurrence in a sequential viewing of George Lucas's revised Star Wars saga is in Revenge of the Sith when Bail Organa, talking with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, says that he and his wife will adopt Leia. It is next heard during the final montage of shots at the end of the film as her adoptive parents, Bail and Breha Organa, hold the newborn Leia.
