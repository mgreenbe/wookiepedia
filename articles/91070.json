However, Calrissian, due to prior dealings with Ferret, was suspicious of him. Upon arrival, Skywalker and Calrissian were accosted by a gang of merchants who mistook them for merchandise, but that matter was settled once Ferret approached them. He informed them that he had been able to scrape together enough parts from damaged Imperial ships to reconstruct four TIE fighters. For security reasons, he had stored the spacecraft on the garbage planet Patch-4, located in the Cademimu sector. Ferret offered Calrissian and Skywalker use of his own private shuttle, which was programmed with the coordinates for Patch-4. Distrustful of Ferret, Chewbacca stayed behind to keep the administrator from betraying their agreement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after landing on Patch-4, Skywalker spotted the TIE fighters. As he and Calrissian approached them, they were attacked by a large creature that seemed nearly impervious to their weapons. Forced into retreating to the nearby caves, Calrissian and Skywalker discovered a community of vagabonds that had settled there. One of the inhabitants, Serja Kesselrook, informed the two Rebels that the creature was controlled by a sonic pacifier on the ship they had been given, which meant that Ferret had been controlling it and had betrayed them. Returning to confront the beast, Calrissian distracted it by shooting his blaster while Skywalker went to the ship and used the sonic pacifier to put the beast to sleep. Then, they retrieved the fighters, returned to get the Falcon and Chewbacca, and returned to Arbra."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
