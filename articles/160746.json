This twin blade variation used Echani cortosis-weave technology which was heavier and less precise, but more powerful than its single-bladed cousin. Ludo Kressh possibly used one, as did Marl the duelist from Taris, and the Sith Governor of Taris. The double-blade, like the double-bladed lightsaber, was difficult to master but could provide an advantage in battle. In addition, double-blades generally tended to cost more than the standard vibroblade. The accuracy of this weapon was questioned in the fact that it was a supposed cousin of the Force pike and the double-bladed lightsaber. Like its Jedi-weapon cousin, a vibro double-blade could cut the wielder in half; the wielder in turn had to be specifically trained to handle the weapon. Someone inexperienced with the weapon would likely injure themselves to the point to maiming or killing themselves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A later version of this weapon was called the double vibroblade, however it lacked the cortosis weave modification."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
