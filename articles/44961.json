A variation of it involved inserting a number of Infiltrators aboard an Imperial craft. The Infiltrators would fly the ship to the designated base. Once inside, they would disable the base's deflector shields and weapons. They would then hide until relieved by the invading force. A variation on the gambit was proposed by Colonel Gharon during the build up towards Operation Cobolt. General Crix Madine accepted his suggestion, but upped the number of infiltrators from 10 to 20."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
