The film was made by the cast and crew of Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones based on an idea by Don Bies (ILM Modelmaker and head of the R2 production unit) and friends."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Plot summary"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The film is narrated in a tongue-in-cheek style, giving the ups and downs of Artoo's life\u2014from his humble upbringings in Bollux, England to his successful life as an actor. The mockumentary achieves this by using interviews by those who \"know\" him, such as George Lucas, Ewan McGregor, Francis Ford Coppola, Richard Dreyfuss, Samuel L. Jackson, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Steven Spielberg and others. We are introduced to his human \"family,\" complete with a brother and a sister (Artoo's birth name, \"Reginald Dillingham,\" was apparently changed for show business). It is revealed that the Star Wars films weren't his first acting roles, and that he had many leading parts in plays and movies both before and after the original trilogy; he was even Coppola's first choice to play Michael Corleone in The Godfather, and Spielberg's to play Indiana Jones."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Artoo is shown to be quite the ladies' man, with plenty of bikini-clad women riding in his limo. After a successful career in movies and theater, a shortage of new work sends him into a deep depression. He goes so far down in this spiral, that in an attempt to prove his worthiness, he bungee jumps and is nearly killed when he forgets to use the cord. His career is then reinvigorated when asked by George Lucas to do Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. Finally, with his life and career back in an upswing, his human girlfriend reveals that she may be pregnant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Release"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A trailer for R2-D2: Beneath the Dome accompanied the US Thanksgiving broadcast of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.
