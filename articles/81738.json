They aggregated information and provided information on the structure and nature of life forms within its range. Life-form analyzers determined the nature of life-forms by using a combination of computer algorithms, sensor scans, and life form indicators to identify life forms. They could not, however, identify unknown life forms. Life-form analyzers used a myriad of factors to determine the identity of a life form, including heart rate, ambient atmosphere, respiratory byproducts, molecule-chain EM polarization effects, and heat signatures."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
