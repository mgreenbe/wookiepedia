Because of the remoteness of the area, Falleen Black Sun Vigo Prince Xizor established a secret laboratory where his scientists and technicians could work to perfect the technology for a human replica droid. Although Xizor hired a band of mercenaries known as the Salissians to eliminate the feral droids, the droids proved too vicious to be controlled. The droids later attacked the Vigo's lab, destroying all research and personnel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During their search for 10-4TO, Den Dhur and I-5YQ discovered a massive reactor leak taking place beneath the Factory District; they decided the leak had caused the droids to become murderous.
