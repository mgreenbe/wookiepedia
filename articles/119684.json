Having received a request from Bog Divinian, the Imperial Advisor stationed on Samaria, Emperor Palpatine coerced Ferus Olin into resolving the problem. The computer virus had been arranged by Aaren Larker, the local Prime Minister, as a deterrent to complete Imperial control of the planet; the plan was carried out by Astri Oddo, wife of Bog, to protect her force-sensitive child from the Imperials. The system was eventually restored by Ferus, who let Astri go."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not long after, Divinian began gaining support on Samaria, as he claimed credit for solving the crisis.
