The sensor would take readings of the visual spectrum surrounding the user, while the holoprojector would display the readings on the wearer itself. By doing so, the OptiRep would make the user appear as their surroundings, essentially rendering them invisible. However, if the user moved faster, it would cause the image being projected to blur, and become distorted. OptiReps were good to use as camouflage, but were hard to acquire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
