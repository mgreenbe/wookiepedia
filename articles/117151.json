The two cuts, a link along with chopped meat underneath, were topped with slaw and Clutch Sauce, Bakkar's signature smoky and spicy sauce, and the filling was served in a flatbread called a ronto wrapper. Bakkar also included a special spice blend that was a family secret. There was also a breakfast version of the dish called the Ronto Morning Wrap and a vegetarian meat-free Ronto-less Garden Wrap.
