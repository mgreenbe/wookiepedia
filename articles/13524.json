One of these Rebels, Jan Ors, had a particular impact on Katarn, who took a liking toward her. Katarn's dilemma was further exacerbated by the arrival of a freighter carrying Rebel reinforcements; despite Hong's suggestion (and formal protest), Kyle insisted that they shouldn't be killed, even though they made more potential prisoners than there were stormtroopers left to guard them.
