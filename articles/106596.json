It was flying patrol in Coruscant's Sector GL5 when a shot rang out and the probe spotted Mandalorian Duchess Satine Kryze beside the body of Davu Golec of the Republic Ministry of Intelligence. The police probe assumed the Duchess had killed Golect and issued an alert to other CSF and Coruscant Guard units. Several police droids and Riot clone troopers took up the chase.
