She was married to the casino owner and crime lord, Vorse Tabarith, who doted on her heavily. She and her father, Arend Shen, hired a group of spacers to steal the Jewel of Yavin, a valuable Corusca gem being auctioned by Marus Grayson, a rival of Arend. Aris was sent to coordinate the group of spacers and informed them they would first drive up prices at an auction for the gem, which she had convinced her husband to attend, knowing he would pay a high price to win the jewel for her. Aris then instructed the thieves to steal the payment after the auction, and finally steal the gem itself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
