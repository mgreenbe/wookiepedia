The R5 series astromech droid R5-2JE used a command signal bolt while serving as the head of the droid pool for the forest landing pad of the Resistance base on the moon Ajan Kloss. Using the bolt, R5-2JE could send similarly equipped Resistance droids commands and work orders from a distance. The bolt was silver in color and similar in appearance to an unmodified restraining bolt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A command signal bolt was first shown on a figure of R5-2JE released as part of a Star Wars: Droid Factory pack of action figures released by Hasbro Inc. in November, 2019. The set was tied into the sequel trilogy film Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, released on December 20, 2019, and although R5-2JE made an appearance in the film itself the bolt was not visible. The bolt was however identified in the accompanying reference book Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
