After the imprisonment of Sa'Kalla, a female Drabatan singer, a movement was formed in her name by the Drabatans and Imperial forces were in danger of being overrun. As a result, the Imperial governor ordered Sa'Kalla be brought out to the Pipada Auditorium, facing half a million Drabatans. Convinced that they had tortured Sa'Kalla into submission, the Empire ordered her to persuade the people to yield to the Empire. Instead, Sa'Kalla shouted for the Drabatans to resist, and was immediately killed on stage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The stadium flared out in violence, with the local Drabatans savagely overwhelming Imperial security forces, and briefly reclaiming their planet.
