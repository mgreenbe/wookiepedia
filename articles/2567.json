The pods joints where held together by explosive bolts, and had shock absorbers and impact sensors in their base. When the pods were being prepared for deployment, a battle ready AT-ST would be loaded into the pod, and the bolts armed. The pod would then be sealed and launched. Upon planet fall, the impact sensors in the pod's base would trigger the explosive bolts, which would then fire, blasting away the sides of the pod, enabling the AT-ST to deploy quickly and easily onto the battlefield."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While on Felucia searching for the captured Senator Bail Organa, Galen Marek fought through a number of Stormtroopers as he moved deeper into the fungal jungles of the world.
