However, the weapon had several drawbacks. It was prone to backfires which could result in the ionization of the vessel that the weapon was mounted on. It also produced a field of nano-scopic particles that alerted enemy ships that starship were carrying the weapon. The Zeta One was primarily used aboard the ships of the Imperial splinter faction, the Restored Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
