By the time he was in high school, Dave was a fan of the Flash Gordon serials and was intrigued by the thought of a big-budget film in that style. He graduated from a Maryland high school in 1975 and headed to St. Mary's College of Maryland as a Fine Arts major. While he was developing his skills in college, he was influenced by his exposure to Marvel comic books while his attraction to science fiction continued to shape his art."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Dorman's exposure to art grew, he soon developed a love for painting while simultaneously keeping tabs on the film industry through magazines.
