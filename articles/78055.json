It contained information about nearly every aspect of Gungan civilization, and when opened, its blood would form pictures and words on its skin. Because of this, the Gungans used the Kresch as an encyclopedia of sorts. The Kresch proved useful when the Gungans colonized Ohma-D'un, because it provided information about all the animals being released on the moon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
