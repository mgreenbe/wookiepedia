When a massive, ancient mining vessel appeared in orbit of Ord Dycoll, the base attempted to hail it, to no avail. A team was sent up from the base in a shuttle to investigate the ship and accidentally triggered its drill appendage to burrow into the planet. Upon reaching its core, the ship caused Ord Dycoll to collapse. Some residents managed to survive the cataclysm in a transport vessel, but had to be picked up by investigators later on when the ship ran out of power. After the devastation, the remains of the world left behind an asteroid field."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
