The Fair was held along Glitannai Esplanade and incorporated dancing, acrobatics, shopping, technology exhibits, food pavilions, and a massive parade of military might. From the surrounding spires, thousands watched as the parade ended in Pliada di am Imperium. There, at the base of the Imperial Palace, dignitaries would bestow blessings on the crowd from an open-air balcony. The Galactic Fair was also the site of the Grand Display, which included exhibits created by various planetary governments. It is currently unknown if the Remnant still celebrated this holiday or not."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
