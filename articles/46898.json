During the war, the rancor was offered for sale as a pet by the vendor droid 80-T5, who sold a wide range of goods from a small stall located within the Jedi Temple on the planet Coruscant. At the time Fang was offered for sale, the rancor was a far smaller size than the normal height of a fully grown rancor, standing at about shoulder height next to an adult Human."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fang first appeared as a purchasable companion for players in the MMORPG Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures released by Sony Online Entertainment in 2010 and shut down in 2014. The rancor could be bought for 500 station cash, a premium in-game currency players had to buy with real money. Given that Fang's purchase was entirely optional, this article makes no assumptions about if it was bought."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
