Typically molecular in size and nature, nanotechnology encompasses a great deal of technology, including nanogene droids, nano-droids and nanoviruses. Said microscopic machines were typically extremely expensive to manufacture, and almost always had a singular function. As a result nanotechnology, and nanites in general were limited to large corporations and medical firms, for use in changing molecular structures in both organics and inorganics alike."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wat Tambor had developed nanotechnology, that enabled him to fuse computer intelligence into his fungus citadel on Xagobah."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
