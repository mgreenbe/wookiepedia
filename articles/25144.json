In 32 BBY, Naboo was invaded by the Trade Federation's battle droid army, and Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala was forced to escape from Naboo to the galactic capital of Coruscant. After her departure, Chamberlyn became a leader in one of the resistance cells that fought against the invaders. When Amidala returned to Naboo with the intention to retake it, the leader of the RNSF, Captain Quarsh Panaka rallied together all the resistance fighters for an assault on the capital city of Theed, in which Amidala hoped to capture the Federation's Viceroy Nute Gunray and end the Federation's occupation of the planet. Chamberlyn then joined the Queen in an attack on the Theed Royal Palace."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Chamberlyn and a number of other Royal Guards, led by Amidala and Panaka, moved through the palace, they were confronted by a detachment of battle droids. In an attempt to circumvent the droids, Panaka destroyed a nearby window with his blaster; he, the Queen, Chamberlyn and several other RNSF members then climbed outside onto the windowsill and used their ascension guns to reach an upper level of the Palace. As they moved in through a corridor, however, the group was surrounded by a number of battle droids, and Amidala ordered her men to lay down their weapons. Chamberlyn and the others were taken to the Palace's throne room to, where Gunray tried to force the Queen into signing the treaty that authorized the Federation's occupation of Naboo. At that point, however, one of Amidala's handmaidens, Sab\u00e9, disguised as the Queen and leading a number of guards, appeared in a corridor leading to the throne room. Exclaiming that Gunray's occupation had ended, Sab\u00e9 and her men attacked Gunray's battle droids, and the Viceroy, thinking Sab\u00e9 to be the real Queen, sent most of his forces after her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The distraction allowed Amidala to open a secret compartment inside her throne and take out a pair of hidden blasters from there, which she and Panaka used to deal with the rest of the droids.
