His actions were uncovered by a combination of Disra's betrayal of the plot as a political power play, and the investigations of Emperor's Hand Mara Jade and the Hand of Judgment (which included Choard's own nephew, Saberan Marcross)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Though Jade originally ordered the governor's execution, a delay caused by Marcross in which Choard almost managed to escape and confusion sown by Caaldra resulted in the decision to let Choard stand a public trial for his treason against the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chorad was highly ambitious and hoped to gain a great deal of power through his plot to take over the Shelesa sector.
