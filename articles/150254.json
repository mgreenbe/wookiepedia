True to its name, it offered fast and effective landspeeder repair for the citizens of the busy town. The company was established several years before the Battle of Yavin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, the shop was nearly lost in 3 BBY when Jamie Turhaya's brother, Matt Turhaya, carelessly bet the company in a sabacc match with the Riileb Tere Metallo. Luckily for the company and Jamie, Metallo refused to take the company as payment after claiming victory due to the fact that Matt was not a full partner in the corporation. As such, Metallo forced Matt to repay his debt aboard her ship, the Star Quest as a new crew member, and allowed Jamie to retain the company."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
