Republic Special Forces Division Colonel Jace Malcom and Republic trooper Sergeant Shanra Immel and her squad invaded the starport with orders to destroy it. Colonel Malcom amended the plan to include the capture of the command ship they saw land. Malcom infiltrated the hangar and the command ship, whilst Immel and her squad were planting target beacons through the spaceport. On the bridge Malcom saw three Sith officers and a female Sith overseer, and engaged the Sith overseer in combat. As the overseer lay dying she initiated the self-destruct mechanism aboard the ship. Malcom evacuated the spaceport as the ship was destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planetary command ship was first mentioned as a Sith command ship in Pablo Hidalgo's reference book The Essential Reader's Companion which was released on October 2, 2012.
