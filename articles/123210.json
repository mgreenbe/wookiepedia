Located between the Milk Stand on Merchant Row and the Droid Depot within the outpost's Land Port, the Service Yard acted as a back-of-house area for the Droid Depot, supplying an oil bath and a droid repair station. The yard formerly housed public baths, and in 34 ABY, it provided public refreshers with facilities suitable for most humanoid species. One wall was decorated with an Imperial probe droid that local Batuuans captured during the Imperial Era. Visitors could hear the BSO 401.72 radio station within the yard. A tall antenna at its center, attached to various strings of cables and other technology, served as a central communications relay station."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Service Yard was created as part of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, a theme park land that opened to guests on May 31, 2019 at Disneyland Park and August 29, 2019 at Disney's Hollywood Studios."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
