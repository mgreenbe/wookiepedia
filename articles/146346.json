Clear, and typically triple distilled, tihaar had a high alcohol content and strong taste that often burned the mouth and throat when ingested. Mandalorian folk humor claimed that the potent tihaar could be used for degreasing engine parts. Tihaar could be made from any fruit that was readily available, including the likes of jewel-fruit or Mandalore's own varos fruit. Every tihaar was different, taking on the flavor of whatever fruit had been used to distill it. Tihaar was traditionally served in a short glass, sometimes over ice, to be enjoyed slowly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mandalorian soldier Rav Bralor was a noted distiller of tihaar, favoring the use of small red fruits in its production. During his time on Kamino, Mandalorian Cuy'val Dar training sergeant Kal Skirata took to drinking a glass of tihaar every night to help him get to sleep; Skirata's supply of tihaar was shipped to Kamino by Mand'alor Jango Fett, template for the clone army in production on Kamino, aboard his starship Slave I. Because of his years on Kamino, Skirata developed a taste for tihaar, drinking it during family meals, and during a meeting with the post-Clone Wars Mand'alor, Fenn Shysa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Five-liter containers of tihaar could be purchased in the marketplace of the town of Enceri on the planet Mandalore. The Sheb Niktose cantina on Vlemoth Port, located within the Mandalorian settlement of Arumorut, served glasses of tihaar for five credits each. Arumorut resident Teroch was a lover of tihaar, drinking the potent spirit in addition to mugs of ne'tra gal. During the Galactic Civil War, Teroch met with operatives of the Alliance to Restore the Republic at the Sheb Niktose, who'd come to Vlemoth Port looking to enlist Mandalorian aid in defending Xorrn from the Galactic Empire. There, Teroch and the rebels drank several shots of tihaar together while discussing Arumorut's history."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tihaar was first introduced to Star Wars canon with an unnamed mention in the 2004 novel, Republic Commando: Hard Contact by author Karen Traviss. The drink again featured and was named in Triple Zero, Hard Contact's sequel, and the second entry in Traviss' Republic and Imperial Commando series. Thereafter, tihaar came to appear in every subsequent entry into the series, including True Colors, Order 66, and Imperial Commando: 501st. Traviss' Star Wars Insider article, The Mandalorians: People and Culture, also provided information about tihaar, comparing the drink to a eau de vie, or fruit brandy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many real-word distilled fruit liquors fit the description of tihaar, including Italian grappa, Georgian chacha, Russian samogan, South Slavic rakija, or Polish \u015bliwowica. What all these drinks have in common is that they all are distilled from fermented fruit and not aged in barrels, which gives them their lack of color and intense taste."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
