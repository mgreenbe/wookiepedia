Many years prior, similar gravity-based technology was available as optional equipment for droids, such as HK-47 and T3-M4 who may have used such attachments during the Jedi Civil War and in the years after. However, these devices operated on a lesser scale and were only capable of temporarily slowing or incapacitating opponents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
