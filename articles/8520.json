Accepting a promotion to Lieutenant, Jorgan got transfered to Ord Mantell and fought in the Separatist War until he was blamed for the defection of Havoc Squad to the Empire and demoted to sergeant. General Vander assigned Jorgan and the last loyal Havoc Squad member to reform the squad, after the which the Republic Special Forces Division General Elin Garza ordered Jorgan and his new CO to hunt down the former Havoc commander Harron Tavus and his followers. The new Havoc foiled the traitors' operations on Taris, Nar Shaddaa, Tatooine and Alderaan, eventually neutralizing Tavus himself.

He relentlessly pursued their tracks despite the interference from Republic Strategic Information Service agent Zane. Eventually locating the last of his former squadmates on Hoth only after two of them had already died from cold, Jorgan learned that Zane intentionally planted hundreds of Republic soldiers into Imperial POW camps, hoping that one of them would eventually lead to the mythical station Dusk 9. In 3636 BBY the galaxy was attacked by the Eternal Empire of Zakuul and early in the Eternal Empire conquest, Havoc Squad's commander went missing. Havoc members drifted their own ways, and with only Jorgan remaining in active military service, he was promoted to the rank Major and given full command of a new Havoc Squad. Becoming disillusioned with the way Republic was run by Leontyne Saresh and its inaction in opposing the Eternal Throne, Jorgan took Havoc Squad on an unsanctioned mission to Zakuul. There, Jorgan allied with the Alliance Commander to plant a wiretap on a Knights of Zakuul listening outpost. Later, Jorgan assisted the Alliance again on a mission to take control or disable the GEMINI frequency at the Hyperwave relay station located below the Zakuul Spire. The mission was a near-total failure, with four of six Havoc Squad members dead, though the team did manage to retrieve a data archive on the GEMINI droids.

Trained to become a sniper, Jorgan joined an elite squad of Deadeyes under Commander Vorne, whom Jorgan had a great respect for. The squad consisted of elite marksmen who performed \"decapitation strikes,\" in which the Deadeye snipers would eliminate the officers of enemy units before Republic attacks in order to leave the opposition leaderless and disorganized. On occasion, the Deadeyes would wait outside an enemy base for weeks while waiting for a clear shot. Jorgan claimed over a dozen confirmed kills with this unit, eventually assuming command.

Among Jorgan's subordinates on Ord Mantell was Felix Iresso, with whom Jorgan would often clash on policy. In 3643 BBY, a shuttle carrying a powerful ZR-57 orbital strike bomb was shot down by the Separatists, who stole the bomb, capable of destroying the entire island of Avilatan.

Though the bomb was by then moved, it was tracked down to the Separatist stronghold, where Commander Tavus took Havoc Squad while ordering Jorgan to keep the Sergeant out of it. Jorgan was then informed by a technician that all communications with Havoc Squad had been lost and decided to nevertheless send the Sergeant to follow his squad and aid in locating the ZR-57, disregarding Tavus' command. The Sergeant was able to locate and disable the bomb, but learned that the rest of Havoc Squad decided to defect to the Sith Empire. Back at Fort Garnik, Command had chosen to blame Jorgan as a scapegoat for the defection, demoting him to sergeant and placing him under the newly promoted Lieutenant of Havoc Squad, its last remaining loyal member.

Garza ordered them to hunt down Havoc defectors, beginning with Jek Kardan. Though Jorgan was all for going out to hunt down Tavus and his followers, Garza stressed that they must first take out the traitors' underworld contacts on Coruscant. Garza first sent the Lieutenant and Jorgan to the Old Galactic Market, putting them in contact with one of her men, Corporal Garrum. The corporal told them that their first target was a cyborg named Krel. The cyborg had been capturing civilians and apparently implanting them with their illegal cybernetics. Fighting through Krel's army of war droids, the Lieutenant and Jorgan found criminal cyborg in his facility. Forced to kill Krel, the Lieutenant was then ordered by Garza to kill all the enhanced civilians within the facility. Jorgan noted that it didn't feel right, and that they didn't know whether the civilians really were enhanced or not. Ultimately, the Lieutenant agreed with Jorgan and let the civilians go. Continuing on with the mission, the Lieutenant and Jorgan were sent to Justicar territory to find and capture Jek Kardan alive. Kardan tried to escape by pitting the present Imperial forces against the new squad. Jorgan and his Lieutenant eventually tracked Kardan down in The Works, where he was guarding a transmitter responsible for the defectors' communications.

With the Galactic War renewed, Havoc Squad was assigned to apprehend Imperial General Arkos Rakton. After rescuing the Dagger Wing from Belsavis prison and freeing the Eighty-first Infantry from their assignment on Voss, Havoc Squad joined the Republic forces in the ongoing Battle of Corellia. There, Havoc Squad led the offensive to reclaim the Bastion from the Empire alongside the Safecrackers and the Fifty-third Armored Platoon.

Jorgan and his CO contacted Republic Strategic Information Service Agent Jonas Balkar, who had previously assisted Havoc in retrieving M1-4X, for information on the Deadeyes' whereabouts. Storming an Imperial-controlled sector, Jorgan discovered that the Deadeyes had been shipped off to offworld camps as menial labor. He attempted to bring the data to Balkar for decryption, but walked in at a bad time, as Balkar was being hassled by Senior SIS Agent Zane. Guessing by Havoc Squad's appearance that they were responsible for the recent attack on the Imperial camp, Zane warned them against future interference, proclaiming his desire to get the Deadeyes back by peaceful means. As soon as Zane left, Balkar said that he couldn't help Havoc with Zane watching him, so he directed Jorgan to his contact Gav in Signal Intelligence who could decrypt the coordinates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Instead of a response from Gav, Jorgan received an abrupt holocall from Zane, who once again warned him to stay out of his operation, which only made Jorgan more suspicious about Zane's interest in the Deadeyes. Left with three choices: ask Jonas Balkar or General Garza for aid or decrypt the coordinates himself, Jorgan eventually decrypted part of the coordinates. Traveling to their location on Tatooine with his CO, Jorgan was able to locate and rescue Torve, Synon and Miev. When Jorgan asked Torve how he got captured, the man realized that Jorgan knew nothing of their mission. Initially Torve refused to say anything, but relented when reminded that he required rescuing and explained that the Deadeyes were implanted with trackers and intentionally allowed themselves to be captured to scout the Imperial penal system. The plan was for the Imperials to take them to their territory so the SIS could rescue them and their comrades. However, they never anticipated that they would be split up and had been awaiting SIS extraction. Jorgan then called for a proper extraction for the captives, after which he got a holocall from Zane, who advised Havoc against further interference in his mission, but still wouldn't disclose what it was. Frustrated, Jorgan asked his CO for permission to cut Zane off, which was granted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Decrypting the rest of the coordinates, Jorgan and his CO traveled to an Imperial prison camp on Hoth, where they were surprised to find Zane himself among the prisoners Berix and Hal. Zane admitted that he had been intentionally letting hundreds of Republic soldiers to be captured in the vain of hope that one of them would be taken to the rumored Imperial prison and black-ops research station, Dusk 9, which Jorgan dismissed as a myth. However, the Imperials didn't consider their captives of enough interest, so Zane bugged himself and allowed himself to be captured, figuring that the brass at Dusk 9 couldn't resist an SIS agent. When Jorgan found out that Koplin and Trace, two of his former comrades, had died from the cold, he became enraged. Drawing a blaster on Zane, he accused him of making false promises to his former squad and demanded to know how many other soldiers had died for his fool's errand. Zane smugly pointed out that Jorgan couldn't kill him with witnesses around, but the surviving the Deadeyes stated that they would just say that the Imperials killed him. Growing terrified, Zane turned to the Havoc CO, who ordered Jorgan to stand down, promising that Zane would answer for what he had done, the right way. Jorgan then relented and Zane subsequently told him that he would see him imprisoned for attempting to murder him. Jorgan then called for a shuttle for his remaining men."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Leading Havoc Squad"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3636 BBY the galaxy was attacked by the Eternal Empire of Zakuul and early in the Eternal Empire conquest, Havoc Squad's commander went missing. Jorgan and M1-4X were stuck in trench warfare for months, and the unit fell apart after the Republic submitted to Eternal Empire, signing Zakuul\u2013Republic treaty. Havoc Squad fell apart as Vik returned to the life of crime, Yuun searched the Unknown Regions for the major, M1-4X was assigned to the Press Corps, and Elara Dorne was removed from Havoc by Chancellor Leontyne Saresh. As the sole remaining member, Jorgan was promoted to Major and given command of a new Havoc Squad, which by 3630 BBY included Dengril, Xaban, Abbeth, Torg and Kanner, Jorgan's second-in-command. That year, Havoc Squad received a piece of intelligence from Jonas Balkar that convinced them to take a leave of absence from their official duties and undertake an unsanctioned mission to Zakuul in violation of the treaty. The objective was to wiretap a Knights of Zakuul listening outpost, gaining access to the Eternal Empire communications. In the Endless Swamp of Zakuul, Havoc Squad went to an arranged meeting point with an ex-SIS agent Theron Shan and the Commander of the anti-Zakuul Alliance. Their meeting was interrupted by Skytroopers and Jorgan ordered everyone to split up and meet at the arranged rendezvouz point, teaming up with the Alliance Commander. While sniping off Skytroopers, Jorgan asked the Commander about their opinion on the Eternal Emperor Arcann before explaining how the Republic was descending into tyranny and decadence under ex-Chancellor Leontyne Saresh and her puppet Jebevel Madon. Witnessing civilians fleeing from skytroopers, Jorgan and the Commander rescued a group of Zakuulan exiles and stopped the droids from burning their homes before meeting with their leader Pashna Veyaad. Unwilling to leave civilians behind, Jorgan radioed ahead and ordered Havoc to prepare their camp for the refugees, while clearing the path for them alongside the Commander. Inside the camp, Jorgan ordered Kanner to get the refugees settled in and complimented the Commander for the lives they saved that day, telling everyone to get some rest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next morning, Jorgan presented his plan for the Alliance, explaining that with access to Eternal Empire communications, Havoc Squad would be able to perform surgical hit-and-run attacks on targets across the Spire while avoiding retaliation.

With the rest of the squad proving their cover, Jorgan and the Commander successfully infiltrated the outpost and planted the wiretap, but on their way out were surrounded by skytrooper reinforcements. Fortunately, Zakuulan exiles led by Pashna Veyaad came to their aid, taking out several shuttles worth of reinforcements with rocket launchers, allowing Havoc to pick off the remaining enemy forces. Their mission successful, Jorgan expressed a desire to train the exiles into a proper resistance force. Leaving the rest of Havoc with the rebels on Zakuul, Jorgan then traveled to the Alliance base on Odessen, where he got acquainted with the Alliance leadership before making his way back to his squad."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The success of Havoc's mission revealed the existence of the GEMINI frequency, the means by which Emperor Arcann controlled the Eternal Fleet. The Alliance planned an attack on the Hyperwave relay station hidden ten kilometers beneath the Spire and connecting the Eternal Throne to the Eternal Fleet. At the briefing, Jorgan strongly insisted to destroy the relay station and sever Arcann's control over the Eternal Fleet, while Kaliyo Djannis urged the Alliance Commander to help her take control of the Eternal Fleet by slicing the frequency transmitter. The Commander assigned Kaliyo to assist Havoc Squad on the mission, with one of them providing a diversion for the other's main objective. Unfortunately, the Commander went missing and was unable to assist them, so the Alliance had no choice but to proceed with the mission regardless. In the process the contact with the infiltration team was lost, prompting the diversion team to attempt a rescue. At that point, the Spire went into full lockdown with no transmissions coming in or out, making any rescue attempt all but impossible. Kaliyo and Jorgan managed to get out and return to Odessen, but four of Havoc Squad's six members were lost in the process, which the Major blamed on Kaliyo.

She then betrayed the Alliance and claimed the Eternal Throne for herself, informing Arcann about the Alliance's location.

The ship emerged from hyperspace in Iokath system, surrounded by the entirety of the Eternal Fleet. Vaylin attacked the vessel's bridge and overpowered both Kaliyo and Jorgan, but was unable to hurt anyone before a blinging white light engulfed the ship. Alliance members found themselves on the surface of the strange world called Iokath, separated from each other and placed in scenarios that resembled combat simulations. Theron Shan managed to get his cybernetic implant working, contacting everyone and directing them to a structure called the Tributary, as they became aware that not only Vaylin, but every Zakuulan and GEMINI droid from the Eternal Fleet found themselves in a similar situation as well. Jorgan noted that the place familiar to other combat zones he's been dropped to and noted that one Iokath remote patched him up a couple of times, while every other droid only attempted to kill him. When every Alliance member from onboard the Gravestone got back together, their position in the Tributary came under attack from local hostile droids, forcing them to find another way out. Theron realized that even though he was unable to locate the Gravestone, he could still use his implant to remotely pilot the Alliance shuttle that was left in its hangar. However, when everyone was aboard the shuttle, SCORPIO contacted the group and revealed that ARIES, the droid that controlled Iokath, raised an energy shield that would destroy any vessel attempting to escape. With ARIES re-charging the weapon that incapacitated them to begin with and promising to use it again on a lethal setting, the only way out was to stop ARIES. SCORPIO revealed the location of ARIES's base and Theron dropped off the Commander and Vette there to deal with ARIES, while the rest went to reclaim the Gravestone.
