Named for the blue chrome that adorned the body of its original models, it was much larger than a normal blaster though well-balanced by a heavy grip and light barrel. Deliah Blue was known to carry a Bluebolt during her time with Cade Skywalker and Jariah Syn. Syn used a Bluebolt blaster during the skirmish on Vendaxa, firing a bolt into Darth Nihl's chest in an attempt to save Cade. Nihl survived, however, due to his battle armor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
