In the search for Jaanie, the spacer was attacked by a stormtrooper squad leader and three other stormtroopers. However, the spacer successfully fought off and killed the four of them. When the spacer reached Jaanie, she thanked the individual, and warned that ISB agents were still after her. Nevertheless, no harm befell the endangered handmaiden.

She was included in the second quest given by Boss Nass, an NPC located at the Gungan Sacred Place on the planet Naboo. In the quest, players were instructed by Boss Nass to find Jaanie and escort her back safely. Completing the quest would earn the player 50 credits. Although the player could choose not to do Boss Nass' quests, this article assumes 100% game completion. Because Jaanie spawned under the generic \"mission_plainsfolk\" template, her graphical appearance was identical to other NPCs in the game, such as Deehan. At some point during the game's early lifespan, Boss Nass' quests were deactivated, effectively removing Jaanie from Star Wars Galaxies. Following the release of Publish 25's New Game Enhancements on November 15, 2005, Boss Nass' content was revamped to become a part of the expansive Legacy Quest series."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
