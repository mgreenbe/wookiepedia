He was stationed on Taris and was inside Doctor Nasan Godera's laboratory together with Eckard Lokin when it was attacked by rakghouls. In the ensuing fight, Ralan lasted longer than his fellow soldiers and managed to finish off the remaining rakghouls before succumbing to his wounds. He did not transform into a rakghoul himself, so his wounds must have come from weapons, not rakghoul bites."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
