The weapon was favored to covert ops for silent takedowns due to its ability to pierce laminate armors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Made from composite materials, the SH-9 was easy to hide and difficult to detect by a weapons scan even by an experienced sensor technician. The weapon was capable of function even when wet or submerged. During the Galactic Civil War, Alliance technicians modified the weapon to make it even quieter. The only noise it made was the faint clicking of the slide as it moved. These modified SH-9s were used by Infiltrators, and SpecOps operatives."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
