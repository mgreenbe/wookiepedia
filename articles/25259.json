It was the homeworld of Rebel Alliance leader and later New Republic Chief of State Mon Mothma. ChandrilTech was headquartered on Chandrila."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Geographical features"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The lush agricultural planet's two main continents were covered with rolling, grassy plains. One species of plant life was balmgrass, a type of grass that was soft to the touch. An idyllic world, Chandrila remained temperate year round, with gentle winters and warm summers. Dry seasons were interspersed with mild drizzles, leading to a lack of drought. Even the winds were mild. Chandrilans lived in harmony with nature, educated from birth in proper maintenance of a balanced ecosystem. Furry squalls could be found wandering within cities, protected by law from harm or capture. They also maintained game preserves where the forest birds, such as blackbacks, were hunted for sport."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chandrila also had huge Crystal Canyons, with bridges and gaps connecting them. The tomb of the third Barsen'thor of the Jedi Order could be found there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sights on the planet included the attractive Gladean State Parks, a wild game reserve near Hanna, Brionelle Memorial Military Academy, and a dacha owned by Rebel Alliance founder Mon Mothma on the shores of Lake Sah'ot. Just offshore of Hanna lay a spectacular coral reef."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Culture and government"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The inhabitants of Chandrila were overwhelmingly Human (96%). Due to government policy requiring small families, Chandrila had a remarkably low birth rate, keeping the world's population of 1.2 billion in check, part of their dedication to a balanced ecosystem and environment. They tended to live in scattered, small communities instead of large metropolises. Family homes always maintained a flower garden, fish pond, insect hive, or some other symbol of natural beauty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "All citizens had a direct voice in government, and were known for vociferously arguing politics among each other. Town squares were equipped with public rotundas for such debates. The planet was ruled by the democratic Chandrilan House. So strong was the public's value of democracy, during Imperial rule, Governor Gerald Weizel chose not to disband the Chandrilan House. Though debates were largely civil, they sometimes became heated enough to lead to violence. Although Chandrila had little experience with open war, some natives were known to nurse grudges and even attempt assassinations, hence the development of personal weapons such as the datadagger."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chandrilans acquired a reputation throughout the galaxy as arrogant and argumentative, due partly to their emphasis on political education and debate. Since Chandrila was a world with perfect climate and docile animal life, native Chandrilans were unfamiliar with the everyday struggles of life in less comfortable environments. Eager to share their paradisaical way of life, they found resistance to their ideas baffling. Those who left their home-world typically found employment as diplomats, negotiators, or artists."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The well-known flatsculp \"Stars and Moons\" had been crafted by a renowned Chandrilan artist."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 25,000 BBY, it was one of the Core Founders of the Galactic Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For 25,000 years, history on Chandrila was as idyllic as its climate. Not once during its membership in the Republic was Chandrila the site of a an ecological disaster or industrial blight. Importing most of its manufactured goods, it was a peaceful, successful agricultural world with a strong economy. The Legislative Youth Program, a mock senate for children, met on Chandrila to emphasize political discourse among the young. The planet was also the location of a Jedi temple and the tomb of the third Jedi Barsen'thor, a hero of the Great Galactic War. Near the end of the New Sith Wars, the world was captured by the Brotherhood of Darkness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet remained loyal to the Republic during the Clone Wars, represented by Senator Mon Mothma in the Galactic Senate. The capital, Hanna City, was the site of a tragic bio-weapons attack perpetrated by Separatist General Lok Durd. Native Senator Mon Mothma, whose mother was Governor Tanis Mothma and whose father was the arbiter-general of the Republic, became one of Emperor Palpatine's most vocal and eloquent critics after his refusal to relinquish emergency powers and continued to speak out after the formation of the Galactic Empire. Mothma was appointed to the Loyalist Committee and was eventually declared a traitor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Chandrilans also established a colony world on G'rho in Wild Space, but it was only ever sparsely settled."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Emperor's New Order"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under the New Order, the Chandrilan House was overseen by Imperial Governor Grandon Holleck, eventually replaced by the aloof Gerald Weizel; Weizel ruled from the Imperial base on the outskirts of Hanna, Chandrila's capital. Weizel answered to Moff Kohl Seerdon, himself a Chandrilan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Canna Omonda was named Chandrila's representative to the Imperial Senate after Mon Mothma's \"resignation\" from that office. When Senator Omonda criticized the Emperor for disbanding the Senate, Palpatine charged Omonda with treason and sent three Star Destroyers to Chandrila to seize her; her public execution was scheduled during Coruscant's Fete Week."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the Rebel Alliance's victory on Fest months after the Battle of Yavin, Moff Kohl Seerdon was furious. Though the theft of AT-PTs on Fest had no relation to Chandrila, he nonetheless chose it as his target for retaliation. Attacking his own homeworld, he sent squads of TIE Fighters to harass the capital city and blockade it with wall builders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To prevent the loss of the capital, the Alliance sent an armored hovertrain escorted by Rogue Squadron. The train carried supplies vital to the prevention of the wall builders. After reaching the city, Rogues took out most of the Imperial attack force. They evacuated the city with Rebel Lambda-class shuttles, winning the battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, the Empire placed stiff agricultural tariffs on the Bormea Sector, which were clearly designed to hurt Chandrila, one of the largest agricultural exporters in the Core Worlds. Likewise, around the time of the Battle of Endor, the Imperials deployed a massive invasion force to Chandrila, and had the Rebels not won the battle, the Chandrilans would have only a few months to contemplate their mistakes before the second Death Star would arrive to destroy the entire planet alongside Mon Calamari, which would be stuck in a similar problem. In the six months after the Battle of Endor, the Empire withdrew all ground forces from Chandrila, cleared out and abandoned all of its facilities on the surface, and deployed seven Star Destroyers in picket formation around the planet. The Star Destroyers, along with support vessels, enforced a blockade, whereby all starship traffic to and from Chandrila's starports was forbidden. With the absence of Imperial ground forces, a provisional government allied with the New Republic was formed, and though it was able to maintain order on the planet, it had little power against the blockade. As Chandrila held little strategic value, the reasons for the blockade were unclear, but it was believed that Grand Vizier Sate Pestage may have implemented a plan, which was later adopted by the Imperial Advisors, to hold Chandrila hostage in case New Republic forces were able to threaten Coruscant. If so, the plan failed. Shortly after the fall of Imperial Coruscant, Chandrila was liberated by the New Republic."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The New Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mon Mothma once again took up leadership of her homeworld. Chandrila became a member in good standing of the New Republic. During the initial chaos of the liberation of Core Worlds, Chandrila acted as a haven for wounded evacuees and soldiers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Emperor's reappearance six years after the Battle of Endor (10 ABY), Alliance historian Arhul Hextrophon traveled to Chandrila to recuperate from injuries received on Caprioril. However, Chandrila too returned to Imperial control under Operation Shadow Hand."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Disciples of Ragnos crisis broke out, cultists and Imperials, led by Tavion Axmis, broke into the ancient Jedi tomb in the Crystal Canyons and attempted to siphon its Force power, but were eventually stopped by the Jedi Jaden Korr."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the time of the Yuuzhan Vong War, the world hoped to be overlooked by the invaders due to its lack of strategic military bases. Late in the war, it had yet to be the target of a major assault and, at the urging of a majority of its populace, opened its borders to thousands of refugees and displaced citizens of the New Republic, though some Chandrilans feared that the drastic increase in population would disturb the world's ecological balance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The PC game Star Wars: Rebellion mistakenly places Chandrila in the Sesswenna sector (a misspelling of the true Seswenna sector), which is actually located in the Outer Rim."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
