The highest-ranking personnel stationed in the Alliance's Echo Base, such as Generals Carlist Rieekan and Pharl McQuarrie and Major Bren Derlin wore an insulated brown cold-weather issue command parka bearing their rank insignia plaque, a brown utility belt, a pair of white Command gauntlets, white pants, gray boots and an insulated watch cap, which had a com set, a face wrap, two cap warmers and a set of Anti-glare goggles all equipped."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lower ranking officers in the base such as Lieutenants Cal Alder and Tigran Jamiro wore the same headgear, pants, boots and gauntlets as the higher ranking officers, but used a sleeveless jacket over a white shirt instead of the command parka. The base's communication center staff wore a variation of the lower ranking officer's outfit with a communication headset rather than the watch cap and with a much higher collar on their sleeveless jackets, matching those of the command parka. The base's technicians wore another variant of the lower ranking officer's uniform which used brown gloves and a simpler cap."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The soldiers of the bases like Colonel Ledick Firest again wore the same headgear and boots, but wore a shorter pair of white gloves, gray or brown pants, and made use of a thermal flak jacket and bulky backpack. The pilots stationed at the base wore a variant of the usual Rebel Alliance Starfighter Corps uniform, with a high-collared orange jacket over the normal flightsuit and white command gauntlets rather than black gloves."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Princess Leia Organa wore an outfit distinct from other personnel that was symbolically white due to her role as princess of the lost world Alderaan. The outfit consisted of a rebel-issue, white all weather vest that was heated, over a white insulated jumpsuit with a pair of gray military snow boots with bindings. Smuggler Han Solo also wore a visually distinct uniform, wearing a dark brown heavy weather parka with a fur-lined hood along with a pair of gray pants and boots."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
