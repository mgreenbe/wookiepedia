Most of these concept figures were based on production sketches from Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, but were not yet marketed as concept figures. The line revisited several characters released in earlier collections, but also introduced some never before released figures from Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. Many older characters were retooled, giving the figures a more movie-accurate sculpt, more articulation and new variations on old themes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In early 2002, four action figures from Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones were released as part of a sneak preview collection. Three special twin figure packs were also produced to commemorate the 25th anniversary of A New Hope, and depicted scenes from that film. The majority of the carded figures came with a card from a set called the \"Force File,\" which contained information on the character's statistics, abilities, weapons and ships."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Continuity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Force File that came with this collection's Jek Porkins action figure is the first source that reveals the name of his astromech droid at the Battle of Yavin, R5-D8.
