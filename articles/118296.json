After the Battle of Yavin, the building belonged to a group of spice dealers led by Vuul Sarlin and was used to stock Ryll prior to its sale in Kor Vella. The spice was provided by the Chirq Council, best known as the Red Circle Gang, but Vuul Sarlin and his men ignored everything about the identity of the ryll smugglers. The warehouse was managed by Jaylon Geissler, the right-hand of Vuul Sarlin."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Circa 1 ABY, the Corellian Security Force started an investigation against the ryll smuggling ring following the increase of spice traffic in Kor Vella. A spacer working for Lieutenant Cope questioned a local spice addict known as Menchi Lerann. The man revealed that he bought his ryll from Vuul Sarlin and Jaylon Geissler. The spacer later interrogated Geissler but the spice dealer obviously refused to collaborate. The spacer therefore entered the ryll warehouse, fought the guards and started to destroy crates of spice. Jaylon Geissler reluctantly accepted to give Vuul Sarlin's current location. The spacer then defeated Vuul Sarlin and forced him to reveal everything he knew about the ryll smuggling ring. The CorSec investigation eventually led to the disbandment of the Chirq Council."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Ryll Warehouse appeared in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
