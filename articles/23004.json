After taking control of Naboo, the Federation set up three camps on separate islands on the Solleu River near the base of a waterfall. The camps held civilians captured during the invasion. A shield gate was built over the river on the side of the islands opposite the waterfall. Camp Three was on the island between Camp Two and the shield gate. The prisoners of Camp Three were freed by Rescue 1 as part of the Raid on the Solleu River. Rescue 1 transported the civilians to the freighter Mercatan which took them to a place safe from the Trade Federation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
