The meeting ended with a decision not to launch an attack, but the recently recruited rebel Jyn Erso assembled a group of rebels willing to follow her to Scarif against the orders of Alliance Command. Erso and Captain Cassian Andor led the group through the hangar and past R3-S1 before boarding the stolen Zeta-class Heavy Cargo Shuttle SW-0608 and taking off to start the Battle of Scarif."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Scarif"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Alliance Fleet was later scrambled from Yavin to aid the rebels on Scarif, R3-S1 was loaded into the astromech socket of the T-65B X-wing starfighter flown by Barion Raner, a pilot flying with Blue Squadron as Blue Four. Upon arriving in the Scarif system, Admiral Raddus directed Blue Squadron to provided cover for the rebel ground forces. In order to reach the surface, all of Blue Squadron raced to pass through the Shield Gate in the planetary shield around Scarif, but after Blue Leader Antoc Merrick made it through the gate began to close. Realising that he did not have time to make it through the closing gate, Raner pulled up in time to prevent him and R3-S1 crashing into the gate and perishing, as Vangos Grek and another pilot did."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Raner and R3-S1 then joined the other members of Blue Squadron who had not made it through the gate in aiding the Alliance Fleet above Scarif. While chased by three TIE/ln space superiority starfighters, the pair managed to destroy one of the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Persecutor's deflector shield generator domes, which allowed the Star Destroyer to later be disabled by Gold Squadron's ion bombs and used to destroy the Shield Gate. With the gate gone, the Death Star plans were then successfully transmitted from the surface and a portion of the fleet, including some of Blue Squadron, managed to escape from the Scarif system. However, Blue and Red Squadrons had lost nineteen pilots and crew during Scarif and an earlier mission to the planet Eadu and so few pilots were left that the Alliance was unsure if it could even field Blue Squadron when the Death Star attacked Yavin not long after."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "R3-S1 had feminine programming and a black sensor.

At some point she picked up a vain programming flutter that resulted in her not working well with others and being competitive to a fault.

R3-S1 stood 1.09 meters tall and, like all R-series astromechs, was manufactured by Industrial Automaton."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "R3-S1 was created for the 2016 Anthology film, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.

Because of this, R3-S1 was known as R3-BHD on set. Prior to the shooting of the hangar scene where R3-S1 appears, a dry run for the droid's movements were carried out and a route that would not get in anyone's way was planned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
