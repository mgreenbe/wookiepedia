For some reason, the system was considered taboo by the Mandalorians at the time. The system was also noted for one of its peculiar oddities, though it was known to only have three planets, the system was filled with mass shadows, more than what could be attributed to three planets, though Malachor V's gravity in particular was also immensely strong."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
