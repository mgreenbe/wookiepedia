After an attack on the two female Jedi by a group of mercenaries, they are instantly saved by Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker. The four Jedi begin a journey to meet with Ansion's government for them to settle with the Republic. However, the foursome's attempts become a bit more complicated with the machinations of Ansion's residing Hutt, Soergg Vosadii Bezhin, who instead wants Ansion to join the Separatists. Nevertheless, the four Jedi make it through all impossible odds with the help of two clanless Ansionians that originally worked for Soergg and had their minds restored to a more fixed way thanks to Barriss's healing talents from the Force. After getting through much of Ansion's wildlife, Anakin, Obi-Wan, Luminara and Barriss make two Ansion clans make a peace treaty that ended their war, thus gaining more support for the Republic. Getting through more of Soergg the Hutt's machinations, the four Jedi eventually coerce Ansion to join the Republic on its voting day, and they successfully have Ansion side with the Republic.
