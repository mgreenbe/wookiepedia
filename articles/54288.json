Ultraviolet radiation from massive stars at its center ionized the surrounding gases to form plasma, which bathed the planets within the nebula in their ultraviolet light. It surrounded the inhabited planets of Umbara and Atoa, respective homeworlds of the near-Humans Umbaran and Atoan peoples."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars the nebula was considered a vital (though isolated) supply route, and the Galactic Republic fought against the Confederate-aligned Umbaran militia for control of their homeworld. After the creation of the Galactic Empire, the Atoan system was conquered after a failed rebellion led by the traitorous Garoche Tarkin and local insurgents."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
