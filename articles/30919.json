The Council of Reconciliation met in the southeast tower of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Overview"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Council of Reconciliation was made up of five Master Consulars tasked with negotiating with political factions both inside and outside of the Galactic Senate. Meeting in the circular Council Chamber at the Jedi Temple, membership on the Council was granted through appointment after a vote of all members. Two permanent members sat for life or until they stepped down, while the other three rotated out after serving a five year term. Due to the nature of the Council's dealings, variety in membership was needed, so that different Masters could lend their knowledge and expertise to a specific situation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Council of Reconciliation had a similar relationship with the Galactic Senate as did the Jedi High Council with the Office of the Supreme Chancellor. Working closely with the Republic Diplomatic Corps, the Council sought peaceful solutions to political debates that arose among different parties or different local governments. At the Council's disposal were the Consulars who were trained as (a) diplomats or ambassadors, as well as a slew of Seers that assisted in making key decisions. Sometimes requested to deal with internal affairs, the Council would pass judgment over Jedi accused of falling to the dark side of the Force, or committing a crime. It was acceptable for other Jedi to appear at the hearing to offer testimony for the accused Jedi. The Council's decision was final, and respected by the other three Councils."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Members of the Council often serve on one of the other Councils simultaneously, or have retired from the High Council and retained their membership. The earliest recorded member of the Council was the famed Seer Sabla-Mandibu who added several chapters to the groundbreaking guidebook, The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force, at the request of Grand Master Fae Coven in the years proceeding the passage of the Ruusan Reformations. High Council Masters Oppo Rancisis and Plo Koon held the two permanent seats around the time of the Invasion of Naboo and throughout the Clone Wars. When Qui-Gon Jinn was called before the Council of Reconciliation after a battle with Captain Arwen Cohl over Dorvalla, the Council of Reconciliation chamber was occupied by Masters Yoda, and Adi Gallia, both serving temporarily. The fifth member of the Reconciliation Council was not present at that time. Later, as the Council questioned Quinlan Vos and his apparent turn to the dark side, Masters Saesee Tiin, Ki-Adi-Mundi and Mace Windu filled the three temporary positions and were present to pass judgment on the rogue Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Council of Reconciliation existed nearly continuously throughout the history of the Jedi Order, except for during the Great Galactic War when it was temporarily suspended due to the militarization of the Order at the time. The Council was disbanded at the end of the Clone Wars when the Republic was dissolved and reorganized into the Galactic Empire. With a Dark Lord of the Sith at the helm of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Council was caught unaware when Supreme Chancellor Palpatine issued Order 66 and began the Great Jedi Purge. Following the fall of the Jedi Temple, the members of the Council were hunted down and killed or else fled into self-imposed exile."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
