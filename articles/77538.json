The Clawdite assassin Zam Wesell piloted a Koro-2 speeder, and utilized it to escape Jedi Knights on Coruscant following her failed assassination of Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Design"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Manufactured by the Desler Gizh Outworld Mobility Corporation, the Koro-2 was powered by an uncommon external electromagnetic propulsion system. The airspeeder's forward mandibles induced ionization in the air around the vessel as it flew, making them conductive to allow paired electrodes to electrify the airstream and magnetically propel it towards the rear. This resulted in the air dragging the speeder forwards, obtaining atmospheric speeds of up to eight hundred kilometers per hour. The lean craft featured a pressurized cabin that could seat two with an air supply of two weeks, allowing it to travel, to a limited degree, underwater or in space."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
