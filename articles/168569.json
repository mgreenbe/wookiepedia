Sick Zolanders were forced to relocate to the Sultur continent. Zolander scientists experimented gene therapy in order to activate natural protection against radiation. The results was positive but created a new species, Clawdites, which were shape-shifting. However, Clawdites were marginalized by the Zolanders and tensions between the two communities increased during the fall of the Old Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zolan was also notable as being the planet where the ancient religious order of Mabari warriors was founded.

However, the assassination of a New Republic diplomat resulted eventually in a full-scale war. The Clawdites later overthrew the Zolander dominance of the planet and came to control 75% of the planet. The war ended circa 25 ABY and the Clawdites made overtures to the New Republic when the Yuuzhan Vong War began. Zolan soon joined the New Republic and shapeshifters Clawdites joined forces with the Republic. About 100 shapeshifters Clawdites formed Guile Company, serving as infiltrators during the war. Guile Company suffered heavy casualties but the organization remained until the end of the conflict. Clawdites eventually became essential to the Galactic Alliance Intelligence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
