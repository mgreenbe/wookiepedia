His heartless desertion resulted in the immediate execution by the Empire of eleven Rebel agents integral to Alliance activities near the Core Worlds.

He unsuccessfully tried to assassinate his former comrades of Eclipse Team, who had become officers of the New Republic. He managed to kill other New Republic agents including Candra, Klepish and Saloor, as well as at least seventy-two non-affiliated civilians. New Republic analysts were surprised at this low figure, as Ma'w'shiye was such a skilled sharpshooter that he could have killed many more if he wished."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "New Republic Intelligence confirmed that Ma'w'shiye had not joined the Galactic Empire. Nonetheless, the New Republic branded him as a threat to its members, offering a 70,000-credit reward for his capture.
