In 3 ABY, the Rebel Alliance's 61st Mobile Infantry targeted Obumubo as part of their campaign Operation Ringbreaker, which targeted a number of weak Imperial targets around the Rimma Trade Route to draw redeployments from the Kuat Drive Yards, the 61st's final target. Everi Chalis, the ex-Imperial governor who conjured Operation Ringbreaker, wished to eliminate an Imperial Military figure and create a vacancy for someone at the Kuat Drive Yards to be promoted to and take their security with them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 61st launched an attack on Obumubo's Imperial garrison. Deployed by dropships, the company took casualties during its first assault. After two days, though, the 61st's personnel setup siege cannons on the moon's fluid landscape which destroyed the garrison, completing the unit's mission. The 61st then fled Obumubo before reinforcements of Imperial destroyers arrived. Meanwhile, the Rebel Alliance Intelligence Service vetted Operation Ringbreaker, and Obumubo was listed in a report on the campaign's first phase by General Crix Madine. The archivist Hendri Underholt acquired the report and included it in a compilation of information called the The Rebel Files."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Obumubo first appeared in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
