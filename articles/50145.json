The base of operations for Lord Cravus, it was from here he led his battle droids with which he conquered the world during the earliest days of civilization on the planet. As Cravus' empire faded away, the Fort remained standing, aging very little over time. Fort Cravus was later renovated and turned into a museum, displaying artifacts and information from Lord Cravus' reign. Unknown to the new owners, however, was that fact that several of Lord Cravus' ancient battle droids were stored beneath the surface in a sealed vault, waiting to be reactivated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
