A forested world situated on the Commenor Run, it was colonized by Humans before 26,000 BBY and was already emerging as a hub of commerce when it became a founding member of the Galactic Republic. In 200 BBY, Tarzen Tagge provided aid to the planet after it experienced a series of groundquakes, precipitating the crime lord's founding of the Tagge Company.

In 200 BBY, crime lord Tarzen Tagge used his fleet of small freighters to deliver supplies and crews to an area of Tepasi that had been devastated by a series of groundquakes, thereby becoming a local hero. By the time the area's production facilities and roads were rebuilt, Tagge had founded the Tagge Company, a construction firm which operated as a front for his smuggling operations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tepasi eventually became the throneworld of the House of Tagge family of nobles, and in 22 BBY, Baroness Sanya Tagge reaffirmed the family's loyalty to the Republic in an address to the populace of Tepasi.

Tepasi was a stronghold of the New Republic during the Hunt for Zsinj of 7\u20138 ABY and the Thrawn campaign of 9 ABY.
