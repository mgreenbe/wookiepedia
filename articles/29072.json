Eleven months after the Battle of Yavin, the Imperial artificial intelligence known as Systems Infiltration Manager took control of the ship, setting off an alarm indicating the imminent meltdown of the reactor core which caused the passengers and most of the crew to evacuate. Comran was one of the few who volunteered to stay aboard with the ship's commanding officer, Captain Hajj, in order attempt to shut down the engines."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When it became clear that the meltdown was a false alarm, Hajj's team set off for the communications room to send a distress signal. Along the way they encountered several violent droids, including one group who were attacking three remaining passengers, Dash Rendar and the brother and sister, Zak and Tash Arranda. Comran helped to destroy the droids and both groups joined up in their efforts to reach the communications room. The group split into two turbolifts to make the journey up to the communications room, but SIM had control of the turbolifts and caused them both to drop uncontrolled. Comran, sharing a turbolift with Hajj, Rendar, the Arrandas and one other crewman, was saved when Rendar was able to halt the turbolift's descent; however, the four crewmen in the other turbolift were killed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The survivors attempted to continue their ascent through a nearby gangway, but a droid under SIM's control dropped a hovercar engine down the shaft at them.
