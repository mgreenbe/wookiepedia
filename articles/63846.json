During the Battle of Yavin the hyper-space navi-rods of R2-D2 were damaged and improperly repaired, leading him to make an error in plotting the hyperspace course of a Rebel scout craft soon afterwards. This led to the craft exiting hyperspace in the middle of an Imperial fleet, starting the Battle of The Keeper's World."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
