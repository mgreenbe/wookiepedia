Examples included many planets, moons, and large asteroids. Almost all species in the galaxy needed some form of atmosphere to breathe. During the height of the Galactic Empire's colonial period, a system of classification for atmospheres was established. This system, which was afterward adopted by nearly all subsequent governments in the galaxy, separates atmospheres into four distinct categories:"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Type I atmospheres"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Breathable"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Type I atmospheres had appropriate levels of oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen to be breathable by the majority of species in the galaxy.
