She was onboard the Fulminatrix when it traveled to the Ileenium system in around the year 34 ABY in order to destroy the Resistance base located there on the planet D'Qar. During the attack she was stationed on the vessel's bridge alongside its Captain Moden Canady, and when the lone Resistance pilot Poe Dameron began attacking the Fulminatrix in his T-70 X-wing starfighter Black One she disdainfully commented that his attack would fail to penetrate their armor. Canady retorted that Dameron was only aiming to destroy the dreadnought's surface cannons, and was proven right when the Resistance pilot destroyed the final turrets and signaled for a squadron of Resistance bombers to attack the Fulminatrix. Despite suffering massive casualties, the bombers were able to destroy the dreadnought, killing Goneril and the rest of the crew."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Goneril was played by Amira Ghazalla in the 2017 film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, but was credited only as \"Canady's First Order officer\".
