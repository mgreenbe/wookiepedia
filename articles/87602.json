They had reached the level of independence where the guilds offered them hunts, but no longer ordered them to take one. They could choose whatever bounty they wanted, when they wanted. They were also given authority to employ Journeyman and Apprentice Hunters to assist with hunts as needed. They typically had been successful enough to own their own ship as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
