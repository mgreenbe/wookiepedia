According to the myths, after Qel-Droma's Master was killed by the Krath, Qel-Droma volunteered to infiltrate and destroy the Krath. However, he was corrupted, turning to the dark side of the Force on Empress Teta, and took over the Krath alongside fellow fallen Jedi Exar Kun. Qel-Droma eventually turned away from the dark side and was redeemed by being cut off from the Force. During his time as a Jedi, he wielded a lightsaber with a powerful yellow-green blade."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ulic Qel-Droma was first mentioned in the new Star Wars canon in the Nexus of Power, a sourcebook for Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars: Force and Destiny roleplaying game published in March 17, 2016.
