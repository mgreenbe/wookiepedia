Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, knowing the Jedi were close to discovering his alter ego, Sith Lord Darth Sidious, ordered General Grievous, leader of the Military of the  Confederacy of Independent Systems, to kidnap him. Also he swept into the system and catching the Republic Coruscant Defense Fleet completely by surprise.

Before the Jedi could rescue Palpatine, Count Dooku arrived with an escort of two super battle droids. After a brief duel, Skywalker killed Dooku at Palpatine's behest. The duo, along with the now-freed Palpatine, were captured by General Grievous before they could make their escape. Skywalker and Kenobi were able to defeat his MagnaGuards, forcing the General to flee. With the loss of the flagship, the Separatist fleet retreated, having suffered heavy losses.

Unknown to them was that Palpatine was Sidious, and he was controlling both sides, in hopes of obtaining his true goal\u2014complete galactic control. Palpatine planned a lightning raid on the planet led by General Grievous, Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. Grievous assembled an armada of thousands of destroyers and frigates\u2014led by the Providence-class destroyer Invisible Hand\u2014for a strike on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, the Republic Group, an anti-Palpatine, pro-Galactic Republic group, decided to retrieve and unveil the Insignia of Unity, which had earlier been stolen by them.

Thousands of delegates, including Padm\u00e9 Amidala and Bail Organa, who would otherwise not have been on Coruscant, remained planetside for post-speech celebrations, and would be there when the Separatists struck. Through the use of a secret hyperspace passage through the Deep Core supplied to them by Darth Sidious, the Separatists managed to jump right on top of the Coruscant Home Fleet, catching them completely by surprise. Most of the Republic ships, caught off-guard with their shields down, were destroyed instantly, but at least a thousand Venator-class Star Destroyers remained intact and functional. Using a jamming signal similar to the one deployed at the Battle of Praesitlyn, the Confederate Navy managed to disrupt all HoloNet transmissions throughout the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the attack was taking place, an investigation conducted by a team consisting of Jedi Masters Mace Windu and Shaak Ti, Captain Dyne of Republic Intelligence, ARC commander Valiant, and his clone troopers within Darth Sidious' hideout in the Works. Inside the building, they were able to track Sidious' path from the building by his footprints; following the trail, the team ended up in the sub-basements of 500 Republica, where they were temporarily halted by security. After being cleared by the building personnel, they continued to follow the trail, but found it to disappear in the middle of an unremarkable ferrocrete floor, and numerous other footprints covering the floor masked where it might have picked up again. It was at this point that a group of ships surrounding the Republica plummeted to the ground. Alarmed, Windu and Ti took half of Dyne's soldiers and left the building through one of its skydock tunnels. Outside, they realized that Coruscant was under attack, and Ti was dispatched to find Palpatine while Windu put the clones on crowd control and left to get backup."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dyne and Valiant, meanwhile, remained in the Republica to continue the search. After scanning the basement, Dyne realized that transmissions on regular frequencies were jammed, and sent a group of probe droids to search for more unusual frequencies; they found one, emanating from the very spot Sidious' trail had disappeared. After discovering a hydraulic turbolift, the two rode it into the depths of 500 Republica. There, they discovered a large metal doorway, behind which, the probe droids said, was one organic and several droids. Dyne and Valiant moved to advance on the door, but upon hearing someone speaking Geonosian, they turned around to find a pair of Geonosian guards aiming at them with sonic blasters. The Geonosians opened fire instantly, and their blasts sent Valiant and his soldiers' mangled bodies flying into the door. Dyne slammed into a wall, his insides liquefied. As he lay there, the door opened and Sidious stepped through, observing the scene. In his dying moment, Dyne recognized him as Palpatine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Outside, the Republic fleet closed in on the Confederate ships and positioned themselves in a defensive screen around the planet. Grievous tried to create the impression that his strike was borne of desperation, as he haphazardly dispersed his warships to target communications satellites, orbital mirrors, and random targets on the surface. Numerically inferior due to half the home fleet being reassigned to the Outer Rim Sieges, the Republic naval commanders fought conservatively while they waited for reinforcements to arrive from the distant battlefields. Anticipating this, Grievous positioned warships at key hyperspace reversion points and deployed mass-shadow mines to delay the arrival of any additional Republic ships."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic quickly figured that the Confederacy was using the same jamming device as they did on Praesitlyn and were able to eventually return transmissions to normal. Thousands of new ships that had been secretly constructed by Kuat Drive Yards for Palpatine, along with many clone troops secretly bred on Centax-2 made their combat debut and entered the battle. They began inflicting some losses on the CIS fleet, even managing to destroy several battleships. In retaliation, Grievous ordered Vulture droid fighters to perform suicide attacks on landing platforms, skyways, and pedestrian plazas in Coruscant's Senate District, causing many military and civilian casualties. Separatist landing craft were deployed onto the surface of the planet, unloading hundreds of thousands of battle droids to create an elaborate diversion while Grievous prepared a raiding party intent on capturing the Supreme Chancellor. Chaos ensued throughout the city, with much collateral damage inflicted in the fighting."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Republic actions"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Desperate to repel the Confederacy, the Jedi sprung into action alongside the Grand Army of the Republic.

Afterward, he moved to help clone forces being overrun by Separatist battle droids and super battle droids in Sector Four. The clone troopers were aided by Windu, who crash-landed his Vulture droid in the middle of the battle droid formation. Hoping to gain reinforcements, Yoda contacted the Jedi Aayla Secura, located on the Outer Rim world of Felucia, but Secura determined that she was too far away and so instead put in motion a plan to capture Shu Mai, one of members of the Separatist Council."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic's Special Operations Brigade began to mobilize and Yayax Squad was sent to defend HNE headquarters in support of an artillery division based near there, to ensure that it could continue to broadcast.

Omega Squad soon responded and arrived in a GAR rapid assault vessel. They contacted Zey, who ordered them to make their way to Coruscant's main utility stations and give ground support to mobile anti-aircraft batteries. However, before they could do this, they were attacked by a Separatist fightercraft and were forced to crash land.

They were eventually deployed at HNE HQ and fought alongside Yayax Squad there, under the command of the ARC trooper, Lieutenant Aven. The Separatists were trying to capture it intact, so had sent in ground troops, which they had to fight off. A wave of super battle droids attacked them, but were easily defeated as some were weakened due to the sabotage of the factories where they were produced, to make them produce inferior droids. They also received air support, in the form of two Low Altitude Assault Transports, which finished off most of the droids.

He entered the center along with Bardan Jusik, Ordo Skirata and Fi Skirata; Kal and Jusik masqueraded as officials from the Chancellor's office, while Fi and Ordo dressed as regular clone troopers. They persuaded the center's staff that they had been authorized to take Uthan to a more secure location, to prevent the Separatists from freeing her. They also took with them Arla Fett, who they unexpectedly found in the facility.

The Jedi lent the senators Allie's speeder to get them to a shelter. With Organa piloting, they fled for safety, but were shot down by Vulture droids and crash-landed in a public plaza. Unfortunately for them, the droids followed them and prepared to attack the three Humans. Amidala and Organa found blasters in a nearby crashed speeder and began to goad the droids into a position where Low Altitude Assault Transports could take them out.

Upon hearing the first sounds of the battle, the troopers left to join the fray. Meanwhile, Shaak Ti returned to 500 Republica with fellow Jedi Stass Allie, Roron Corobb, and Foul Moudama, this time to Palpatine's suite. They were at first denied access by Palpatine's Red Guards, but when Palpatine completed his trip from the basement, the guards let the Jedi in just short of Ti forcing her way through. Palpatine, along with his adviser Sate Pestage and Director of Republic Intelligence Armand Isard, met with the Jedi inside. The Chancellor refused to evacuate to a secure bunker, insisting that he set an example by not hiding away, though Isard, Pestage, and even the captain of Palpatine's guards agreed with the Jedi that he needed to leave. Sensing a perturbation in the Force, Ti and Allie tackled Palpatine to the ground as the gunships outside the suite's window exploded, and a Separatist craft carrying Grievous and a band of battle droids rose into view. Grievous blew open the window and, as the battle droids poured into the room, Allie and the Red Guards set up a defense while Ti hurried Palpatine deeper into the suite."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The skimmers, meanwhile, had taken up the attack on Grievous' ship, and soon enough the general and his droids were forced to withdraw. As Isard alerted Homeworld Security that Grievous had broken through Coruscant's defensive perimeter, Palpatine had decided it was indeed time to evacuate. Grievous, however, quickly returned, bursting through the window. Palpatine stood his ground, facing down Grievous, but Ti pulled him back with the Force and the group ran, with a squad of clone troopers remaining in an attempt to hold back Grievous. Suspecting that the prepared escape routes had been compromised, Ti had the party hurry to one of Republica's private turbo lifts. Having defeated the troopers blocking him, Grievous ambushed the Chancellor's party as they were waiting for the turbolift to arrive. Corobb, an Ithorian, used his four throats to emit a powerful blast that tore up the hallway and drove Grievous back long enough for them to enter the lift. Grievous attempted to catch up with the turbolift, but the Chancellor's clone trooper escort fired a rocket through the lift's wall, blowing Grievous off the side of the building. At the bottom, Ti saw no sign of Dyne and Valiant, and the group made their way through the tunnel to the east skydock. They had not escaped the Separatist forces yet, though; Grievous was waiting with an army of B2 super battle droids outside. Corobb used his trick yet again, buying them the time they needed to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his search, one of Grievous's Magnaguards faced off against X2, who destroyed it. The clone trooper soon spotted the droid General himself and began following him through the battle-torn Coruscant; X2 eventually tracked Grievous to a Skylane transportation hub. Tired of X2's persistence, Grievous ambushed the trooper there and attacked him. X2, however, used explosives against Grievous that threw him into the planet's traffic and injured him. Having faced with a challenging enemy, Grievous decided to retreat and continued his search for Palpatine. Rejoining with X1, X2 took an ARC-170 starfighter and joined the space battle. Meanwhile, the Jedi hurried through the city, leaping from platform to platform with two MagnaGuards closely in pursuit. They jumped onto a floating barge, but were shortly joined by four MagnaGuards and Grievous himself, who disabled the barge's repulsorlift generators. The Jedi fled into a subway station, leaping over trains and narrowly avoiding death as they fought the MagnaGuards on the tracks. Shaak Ti finally managed to destroy two of the droids, and Corobb destroyed another. As Grievous appeared and backed the Jedi into a tunnel, Shaak Ti used the Force to wrap his cape around a pipe on a train carriage. She activated the train, and Grievous was yanked down one of the tunnels. The Jedi decided that air vehicles would be too risky, and, meeting with Windu and Fisto, boarded a maglev train that would get them near the bunker."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, Grievous's gunboat retrieved the General and he caught up with the Jedi's train.

The duel ended with Grievous being pushed off the train, although he was saved by a hijacked LAAT/i gunship, unknown to the Jedi. Once the train reached a repulsorlift platform, Ti, Allie and Palpatine, accompanied by Corobb, Moudama, Roth-Del Masona, and B'ink Utrila, rode a gunboat to Sah'c Town, where the secure bunker was waiting. Fisto and Windu split from the group and went in pursuit of Grievous' droid gunboat. However, upon destroying it, they found nothing more than a super battle droid, and returned to the bunker, realizing this had been a diversion that would lead to the Chancellor's kidnapping. Outside the bunker, Corobb, Moudama, Masona, and Utrila led the Chancellor inside while Ti and Allie stayed outside to assist in defense. Grievous's hijacked LAAT/i gunship suddenly appeared, successfully penetrating the bunker's shield and crashing in the process. He then made his way inside, with six of MagnaGuards in tow.

Ti insisted that she stay behind to hold off any of their pursuers; Palpatine and the Jedi felt unsure in abandoning Ti, but she claimed it was to assure the Chancellor's safety. As the turbolift hurried off, Ti engaged in combat with a large number of MagnaGuards that emerged from the darkness. She was temporarily deprived of her lightsaber and nearly overwhelmed, but managed to obtain an electrostaff from one of the MagnaGuards, reclaiming her lightsaber and using both weapons to fight her enemies off."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Once the four Jedi escorted the Chancellor to the center of the bunker, they were confronted by Grievous, who engaged them in a lightsaber duel. In the early stages of the fight, Corobb and Moudama managed to get the General into a saber-lock, but it was at this point that his arms split into four, grabbing the lightsabers on his waist and provoking the general to lunge forward at the Jedi. He toyed with his foes for a time before decapitating Masona first. Corobb, who accidentally kicked Masona's head across the room during the fight, lost his focus and became distracted long enough for Grievous to kill with a stab to the heart. Putting forth his best effort, Moudama charged the General but lost his lightsaber arm and then his left leg before being disemboweled. He then toyed with Utrila, letting her gain a slight advantage by striking the General in the arm. Finally, Grievous put his enemy out of her misery with a stab to the heart."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Shaak Ti finished off the last of Grievous's MagnaGuards, just as the droids retreated back into the shadows. Realizing they were a diversion for Grievous to reach the center of the bunker, she raced to the scene, just as Grievous was threatening Palpatine. As Shaak Ti ran into the room, she saw Grievous holding the Chancellor by the neck collar, the latter of which remarked dryly how she had come to his rescue. She charged at Grievous, but she was too exhausted from her engagement with the MagnaGuards. Grievous was aware of this, so he quickly subdued her by the neck with one split hand, confiscated her lightsaber for his \"collection\" and trussed her into a stun-net as to warn the Jedi of the Chancellor's capture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Grievous fled with his captor to a tri-wing shuttle stationed nearby, Windu and Fisto arrived in their gunship.

As the General coughed violently, his lungs cut by bits of duranium, the shuttle lifted off; Windu leaped upward in an attempt to board it, but the shuttle's laser canons fired at him, knocking him back down to the landing platform and leaving him fuming. Windu and Fisto, meeting up with Stass Allie and Corrob's Padawan Drake Lo'gaan, entered the bunker, searching for the occupants. Once at the central room, they found Shaak Ti incapacitated, with the four Jedi slain. Neither Grievous nor Palpatine were in sight, and Lo'gaan, distraught, cradled the body of his dead master while Allie collapsed at the sight of the slain Jedi Knights. Shaak Ti, lamenting her failure, showed Windu and Fisto a security recording of Grievous's escape, while a clone trooper explained that the General had exited through way of the south tunnels.

Windu and the Jedi were right behind Grievous when a swarm of five hundred droid fighters, launched from a Trade Federation battleship, enveloped the shuttle in a defensive screen. As the shuttle neared its destination, the flagship opened fire on the pursuing Jedi fighters. While one of their comrades was killed, Pablo-Jill and Sageon were captured by the Invisible Hand's tractor beams and brought into hangar bay.

Nonetheless, Skywalker immediately regretted the decision, with Palpatine feigning sympathy regarding Skywalker's regret, and also acknowledged it wasn't the first time Skywalker gave in to anger, alluding to Skywalker's slaughter of the Tusken Raiders after they tortured the latter's mother, Shmi Skywalker Lars, to death."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Continuing battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the confrontation between the Jedi and Sith ended, the Invisible Hand entered a direct engagement with the Venator-class Star Destroyer Guarlara, exchanging broadsides with the warship. Both sides fired at the other with heavy turbolasers. The Republic destroyer managed to damage the Invisible Hand's systems, causing it to lose control. Sustaining crippling damage, the Separatist command ship temporarily fell toward Coruscant before regaining control. However, with artificial gravity, tensor fields, and inertial compensators failing, the ship had become a rapidly decaying space wreck."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Escape was now Skywalker's priority. He gathered up the unconscious Kenobi, despite Palpatine's demand to leave him and headed back for the bank of turbolifts. However, due to damage sustained during its battle with the Guarlara, the turbolift system was rendered non-functional, and with the Invisible Hand accelerating a descent down to Coruscant, Skywalker and Palpatine were forced to travel directly down the shaft. Before they could reach their destination, however, the ship, due to the bridge crew activating the ship's emergency booster engines at Grievous's order, righted itself, thus causing Skywalker and Palpatine hang onto a ledge, the jolt of which also resulted in Kenobi regaining consciousness. To make matters worse, the turbolift Anakin called for earlier also descended to their location due to miscommunication with R2-D2, nearly crushing them. Skywalker attempted to call R2-D2 to stop it, but Kenobi told him to jump, realizing there was no time for that. They eventually ducked inside an open elevator door, narrowly evading the speeding elevator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi then headed for the hangar with the Chancellor. As they headed back to the hangar, the Jedi were confronted by battle droids, which they dispatched. They then received word that a Republic cruiser was being attacked by a Separatist cruiser, and its systems were failing fast. Anakin took control of a laser turret nearby, and fired on the Separatist cruiser, eventually destroying it. After this, the Jedi continued on to the main hangar bay. Before they could reach it, however, Grievous learned that they were in Hallway 328 of the Invisible Hand and ordered that the ray shields be activated; likewise, the shields dropped on the Jedi and Palpatine. Skywalker was sure that R2-D2 would arrive and release the shields, but as the astromech came screeching in, droidekas unfolded and aimed at him; a super battle droid even kicked him down to his back after being zapped in the blaster arm.

The Jedi were able to summon their lightsabers back as Grievous ordered his MagnaGuards to dispose of the Jedi and make sure they suffered. After a quick battle, the Jedi defeated the droid warriors (with Obi-Wan initially having difficulty due to beheading the droid not destroying it) and closed in on Grievous, intent on capturing him. Grievous, in his weakened state, grabbed an overloaded electrostaff wielded by one of his MagnaGuards and threw it into the damaged bridge viewport, shattering it violently."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grievous allowed himself to be sucked out into space, and later re-entered the ship through an escape pod hatch. In an attempt to foil the Jedi's escape, he launched every escape pod on his flagship and fled to a nearby Trade Federation battleship.

Losing structural integrity, the entire rear end of the Invisible Hand tore off due to atmospheric stresses. Despite this, Skywalker, in order to avoid adding to the already massive damage Coruscant had already sustained from the fighting, successfully crash-landed the ship on a long, seldomly-used landing platform at the industrial center in Galactic City with the help of Fire Team Three (at the cost of two of its members), although the landing also resulted in the destruction of one of the observation towers on the platform in the process. With the loss of their flagship, the failure of their main objective, and the recovery of their supreme commander, Grievous, the surviving elements of the depleted Separatist armada retreated in disgrace to the Outer Rim. A few pockets of fighting carried on among the anti-Republic elements of the Coruscanti population, who had risen up during the battle. However, they were eventually defeated. While the battle had been raging above them, a group of agents from the Cularin system had been fighting the Dark Jedi Garth Ezzar in the Undercity and not long after the fall of the Invisible Hand, they finally succeeded in killing him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was later revealed that the battle's only purpose was to get Darth Sidious off the capital to thwart the Jedi's attempts to track him down. Sidious also used the capture of his alter ego Palpatine to see if Skywalker could use his anger to defeat Darth Tyranus and become the perfect apprentice for Sidious. His ruse was so effective that even the Jedi were fooled. Afterward, Sidious contacted Grievous shortly after the latter arrived at his base at Utapau, ordering him to relocate the Separatist Council to Mustafar. Upon processing the order, Sidious then told the general that the war's end was near. Although Grievous protested that the loss of Count Dooku meant the Separatists are likely to lose the war, Sidious assured him that Dooku's loss was a necessary one, and inferred that he will soon gain a new Sith apprentice, one that would be much younger and more powerful."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the loss of Dooku, Grievous assumed the title head of state of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, but it greatly destabilized the Separatists' power structure.

However, the Revenge of the Sith novelization stated it lasted only a \"long, long day.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Accounts of this battle have been conflicting and which version is the canonical depiction is ambiguous. This discrepancy is primarily due to the fact that the Star Wars: Clone Wars series and the novel Labyrinth of Evil (published two months before the Battle of Coruscant Clone Wars episodes aired) gave differing versions of what happened. In the animated series, Mace Windu and Yoda together destroyed a small army of battle droids, whereas Labyrinth of Evil did not show Yoda participating in the battle and depicted Windu helping to protect Palpatine, dueling Grievous aboard a maglev train, which was mentioned in the Revenge of the Sith novelization. In Labyrinth of Evil, the Jedi defending Palpatine in the bunker (Roron Corobb, Foul Moudama, Roth-Del Masona, and B'ink Utrila) were defeated relatively quickly by Grievous and did not join in protecting him until relatively late in the battle, whereas in the animated series Corobb and Moudama assisted Ti in protecting the Chancellor from the beginning, going on a long chase through the city before finally being defeated by their quarry\u2014Utrila and Masona were never present.

First, they fought enemy droid fighters, and eventually X2 and some clone troopers boarded a Providence-class carrier/destroyer. Inside the ship, X2 commandeered its orbital strike cannon and used it against Separatist ground forces that had been deployed onto Coruscant's surface. This provided the Republic support by hampering the Confederacy's ground invasion. Once complete, X2 and his clone brothers departed the ship in escape pods and reached the planet's surface in order to support the Republic's forces against the Confederacy. X2 reached Jedi General Mace Windu's location, and Windu tasked him with repairing a defense turret in order to blast Separatist barricades surrounding the Senate building.
