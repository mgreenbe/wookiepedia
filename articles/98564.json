Attached to the workshop, the home featured a sizable yard, where Vevut could occasionally be found machining parts for weapons at a grinding bench. Though Vevut had little concern for leaving metal shavings in the yard, visitors to the home were expected to remove their boots upon entering, a common courtesy in the Mandalorian culture."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the start of the Second Galactic Civil War, the Keldabe home housed Novoc Vevut and his adopted son, Ghes Orade. However, in the year 40 ABY, Vevut's home also became the residence of Mirta Gev, the granddaughter of Mand'alor Boba Fett and Orade's girlfriend, and later, wife. Following the marriage of Orade and Gev in early 41 ABY, a large celebratory feast was held at the Vevut home."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Novoc Vevut's home first appeared in Star Wars canon in the Star Wars: Legacy of the Force novel, Legacy of the Force: Sacrifice, written by author Karen Traviss and published May 29, 2007.
