However, Shan betrayed her and teamed up Valss, who joined the Human after having experienced a vision of his victory. Together, they stole from Zenta the location of a holomap leading to a superweapon of the Sith Emperor Vitiate which had long been kept in secret on Copero by slicing into her personal datapad. Afterwards, they took Zenta's best fighters and abandoned her to the joint Ascendancy-Alliance team send by Aristocra Saganu of the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force to deal with the rogue Syndic. Raina Temple and the Alliance Commander engaged Zenta in combat and subdued her, after which she explained that she had been duped by the Shan just like they had been.
