Instructing the droids on the ground to activate the detonation sequence, Grievous also mentions that the Viidaav colonists should be left to live on in history. The signal is transmitted to the mining array, and is soon detected by both the Republic and Viidaav forces. Both rushing to stop the detonation, the two groups rush towards the same goal. Fighting gunships, battle droids, and security systems, only the two commanders are left in the end. Facing each other with only seconds before detonation, the fatal shot is fired and the Viidaav leader is dead, but not before he shoots the computer. The planet is saved, but not by the clone trooper, but by the Viidaav he shot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
