During the invasion of the planet Naboo in 32 BBY, he was a leader in the initial landing on the world and was tasked with protecting one of five droid control programs, physical brown cubes that kept the Droid Army active. However, OOM-14 was unable to protect the device, and a Royal Naboo Security Forces team called Force Command Two stole it, rendering his army inoperative at a Deactivated Camp. Knowing that the program in the Naboo's hands could compromise the Trade Federation's invasion efforts, Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray ordered OOM-9, his personal command droid, to steal back the program from the city Harte Secur, where it was being studied by the Naboo. OOM-9 retrieved it and reactivated OOM-14's army with the help of a Neimoidian technician, thereafter leading a retaliatory attack on Harte Secur."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "OOM-14 was a B1 battle droid that stood 1.91 meters tall.

However, OOM-14 is included in the scenario editor mode of the game, where he is a unit that can be put in a player-made level.
