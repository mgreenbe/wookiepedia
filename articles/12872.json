It was armed with a single turret-mounted laser cannon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the principal strengths of the Barloz-class freighter was its size: forty-one meters long, twenty meters high, and capable of storing over eighty-five metric tons of cargo. The size, coupled with the craft's durability, made it an ideal craft for cargo shippers and smugglers. Barloz freighters were woefully under-armed, however. A single laser cannon, fixed in a front-firing position, was the craft's primary defense system. In addition, the Barloz was not very maneuverable, making its only option in a fight a hasty retreat. Still, the craft had a thick, durable hull capable of resisting a fair amount of damage, allowing captains to pilot their craft out of a combat zone relatively unscathed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Barloz was equipped with a CEC NovaQuad-D Drive System, the precursor to the engines used in the YT-series craft.

It was considered affordable, sturdy, and spacious. In the latter days of the Old Republic, a medium freighter was equivalent to the light freighter of the Imperial era. Long since supplanted by the YT series, modified Barloz freighters continued to compete against its descendants in the Outer Rim Territories. The Barloz was developed roughly three decades before the Corellian Engineering Corporation unveiled the YT-series craft. Several of the \"design innovations\" touted by CEC pitchmen were in fact introduced aboard the older Barloz. However, CEC's aggressive marketing campaign for the YT-series spelled the end of the venerable Barloz."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
