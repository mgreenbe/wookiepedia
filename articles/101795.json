It was first used when Maarek Stele was set up by Admiral Harkov and had called for backup. Its next sighting was when the Immobilizer 418 cruiser Harpago, under the command of Grand Admiral Zaarin, tried to trap a TIE/D Defender squadron which had Darth Vader as one of the pilots. The Osprey picked up Darth Vader and, after the Harpago's destruction, escaped into hyperspace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
