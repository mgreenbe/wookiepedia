It destroyed rogue comets that strayed into shipping paths and supplied astrometric data to Cularin SpaceNav, showing safe courses through the cloud. They also occasionly used detonite or mines to alter the courses of large comets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The company employed about 40 permanent and 60 temorary members of staff and was based on Artom Station.

During the time of the Clone Wars, the Dark Jedi Garth Ezzar disguised himself as Jedi Master Lanius Qel-Bertuk and met with the two Wookiees to hire the Service to initiate the Cometary Water Reclamation Project. The project was supposedly meant to launch a comet into the atmosphere of the planet Almas, to add more water to the atmosphere, although Ezzar had other plans for it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ezzar deliberately placed a mistake in the data supplied by the Service. This resulted in the freighter Fricasseed Nerf being damaged and the heroes of Cularin were hired to investigate. They traveled to Artom Station and met with Mronk and Rroorgli, who assured them that there had been no problems with the data."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A short time afterwards, Garth Ezzar murdered Mronk and Rroorgli. Their bodies were discovered by a Comet Broom security team, which then stopped any ships from landing on or taking off from the station until someone could be sent to investigate the deaths."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
