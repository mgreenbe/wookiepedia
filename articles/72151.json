They featured two yellow wings, a lengthy purple tail with two widely separated ends, and a pair of spindly brown legs ending in three-clawed feet. They had a wide yellow beak with serrated edges on both mandibles and two nostrils located on the upper mandible."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behavior"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jubba birds were native to the swamplands of the planet Dagobah, where they used mud scooped from Dragonsnake Bog to make heavy nests that weighed down the trees in which they were built. As natural Force-users, the birds were known for their soothing songs, which reached beyond simple melodies and could calm creatures and beings through subtle manipulation of the Force. Jubba birds flew low enough above Dagobah's swamps to be within range of a dragonsnake rearing up from under the surface of the water to try and catch the bird in its jaws."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A handful of smugglers were among the only individuals who knew of Dagobah during the Galactic Civil War, and they occasionally traveled to the planet in order to capture jubba birds, which were prized throughout the galaxy for their songs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the dangers on Dagobah's surface, the smugglers never landed on the planet, instead snatching jubba birds from the upper section of the jungle canopy in their starships before leaving.
