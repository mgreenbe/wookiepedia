By the time period after the rebellion on Akiva, it was generally believed the Empire was in serious danger of losing the world. Among the Imperials trapped on the war-torn planet was Commandant Brendol Hux of the Arkanis Academy. Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax gave orders to escort Hux and his son safely off-world, a task accomplished by bounty hunter Mercurial Swift. Soon after, the world fell to the New Republic. In response to the defeat, Grand Admiral Rae Sloane was scheduled to issue a statement on behalf of the Office of Imperial Promotion, Galactic Truth, and Fact Correction."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
