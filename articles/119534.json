Imperial forces established a garrison in the capital, Netassa, with fortified outposts at key commercial and transportation facilities. The ISB organized aggressive undercover purges to eliminate potential malcontents and future political troublemakers from the general population of disgruntled ag laborers; the resulting mass arrests necessitate a recruitment campaign to lure beleaguered workers from other systems to labor in Salliche's agricultural industries.
