Around 5 ABY, the New Republic Intelligence flagged the massacre at Anx Minor as possible activity of the Galactic Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing. The event was then reviewed by the New Republic Intelligence agent Caern Adan and his colleague Yrica Quell. Quell felt that the massacre had similarities with the 204th's raid on Beauchen, but also noted that it was distant from other reviewed events on her and Adan's map."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The massacre at Anx Minor was mentioned in the 2020 novel Shadow Fall, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
