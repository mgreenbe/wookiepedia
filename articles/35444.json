The development was still underway, with even a sequel in pre-production, when LucasArts saw major changes in its leadership, management, and strategies in early 2008. According to Free Radical direction, this led to Battlefront III being stalled by LucasArts for several months before being ultimately canceled. The situation was quite hard for Doak, who described it as \"the most depressing and pointless thing\" and the cause of a \"nervous breakdown\" that saw him leaving Free Radical around that time."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External Links"}]}
