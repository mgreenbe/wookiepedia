A blue-eyed man with a ginger mustache and fair skin, the technician worked at the main hangar of the Redemption two months following the pivotal Battle of Yavin. He was secretly contemptuous of the young Princess Leia Organa, refusing to consider her as a full-fledged soldier of the Alliance. After Organa returned to the Redemption following a mission to the Dominus sector, she handed her helmet to the technician and asked him to take care of her T-65 X-wing starfighter. The technician made a sarcastic comment behind her back, but was overheard by Organa's wingman and fledgling Jedi, Luke Skywalker. Skywalker informed the man about Organa's action during the mission, and the technician apologized to the pilot."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The technician wore tan fatigues and a helmet while on duty."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The technician appears in the first issue of Dark Horse Comics' 2013 title, Star Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
