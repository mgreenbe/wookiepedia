When Yoda first arrived on the Force planet he was greeted by Serenity, who informed him that he had arrived later than expected by the priestesses, who were waiting for him. She then led Yoda to a gathering room where Confusion and the other priestesses manifested around him. Each of the priestesses reacted to Yoda in a manner befitting the emotion they represented, with Confusion questioning why Yoda was on the planet. After Yoda had explained why he was there, Serenity asked for other Priestesses to give their blessing for Yoda to receive the \"great gift\" of immortality. The five Priestesses then began spinning around Yoda while holding hands, becoming a blinding blur. The Grand Master then awoke elsewhere on the planet, finding only Serenity there to guide him to the first test."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yoda succeeded in overcoming his fears and passing the first test, after which Confusion and the other priestess manifested behind Serenity as she claimed Yoda must trust in their teachings to succeed. Yoda was then directed to pass through the Valley of Extinction, where the Priestesses warned him he must avoid emotion, as otherwise he would see their faces and be seduced. Yoda failed to control his emotions, but successfully resisted the Priestesses attempts to tempt him promises of a world of peace and no war. Once Yoda emerged from the valley, he was greeted by Serenity, before Confusion, Anger, Sadness and Joy set his final test, ordering him to travel to the planet Moraband, homeworld of the ancient Sith. Their challenge issued, the Force Priestesses then de-manifested, leaving behind only their robes and masks, which fell to fall to the ground."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Moraband, Yoda was confronted by specter of the Sith Lord Darth Bane who tried to tempt him to the Dark side but was unsuccessful. Confusion and the other priestess then manifested before Yoda, warning him that while all his previous trials have been conjured by them, the final test was out of their control. Yoda was to enter a chamber of darkness where the Sith once sacrificed Jedi, and where he would have to face the Sith of his time, Darth Sidious and Count Dooku. The five then faded away, leaving the Grand Master alone for his final challenge. Yoda faced the Sith, and emerged from the chamber, where he was informed by Serenity that Jinn would commune with him and train him to become immortal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Confusion's form was mutable and while interacting with Yoda she manifested as an aspect of Confusion, wearing black robes and a white mask bearing a confused expression.
