The dish was considered a delicacy by the Human scholar Ebenn Q3 Baobab, who advised any Humans visiting the spaceport of Mos Eisley on the planet Tatooine to try it in the Hutt eateries found there. The advice was part of his recommendation of the dish as one of his favorites in his book, Galactic Phrase Book & Travel Guide, which was authored in 6 ABY. The dish was mentioned in the Huttese section of the guide, which also explained that Huttese dishes were usually eaten casually in a random order. Baobab also claimed that Hutt cuisine was expensive, and that utensils were optional when eating it, although gloves were recommended."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Scurrier tips were first mentioned in the 2001 book, Galactic Phrase Book & Travel Guide, which was written by Ben Burtt.
