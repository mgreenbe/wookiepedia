Usually, that process was used only for short periods, and prolonged stasis could cause a form of poisoning. Having learned of a Sith plot to destroy the Jedi Order toward the end of the Clone Wars, the clone trooper CT-6116 was abducted and put in a cryo-cycle stasis pod aboard a Separatist cruiser by Count Dooku. He was freed from the stasis fifty years later, when Sidon Ithano's crew discovered his pod."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
