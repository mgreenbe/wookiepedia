In 3637 BBY a group of individuals hired by exiled Ravagers Captain Ruugar boarded the vessel while it was docked in Coratanni Town. Aboard they faced and defeated the Chief Engineer Torque, who was defending engine room. After the Wookiee was killed, Ruugar took the ship to the skies and announced to the crew that he has returned as their captain. As the Soaring Duros approached Coratanni's flagship Pearl's Girl, the droids Blaster and his maker Master were send to stop the invaders, but they failed and were destroyed. Ruugar's team then took a shuttle from the Soaring Duros to Pearl's Girl, where they killed both Coratanni and Ruugar, after he decided to backstab them instead of honoring their deal."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Soaring Duros appears in the Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan expansion, released on December 2, 2014."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
