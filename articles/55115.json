GoCorp employed the EV-series supervisor droid EV-9D9 to supervise the plant's droid workforce for a stint in the year 1 ABY. Unfotunately for its dozens of worker droids, the corporation appreciated and encouraged the supervisor droid's derangement. Under her supervison, the laborers were unbelievably overworked and had a high attrition rate, but production was well beyond what droids were normally able to accomplish. While the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure was commissioning several sand skiffs at the GoCorp repulsor plant, a few of his agents discovered EV-9D9 supervising the plant. Impressed by her ability to drive droids far beyond their capacities, the henchmen bought the supervisor droid and put her to work in Jabba's Palace on the planet Tatooine."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The GoCorp repulsor plant was first mentioned in Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi, a 1990 Star Wars Legends reference book written by Michael Stern."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
