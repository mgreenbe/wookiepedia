The family's origins dated back to Shmi Skywalker, who, as a young girl, was captured by pirates and forced into slavery. In 41 BBY she conceived a son, Anakin Skywalker, who was born without a father. Anakin was the Chosen One destined to bring balance to the Force by destroying the Sith. Posessing the highest concentration of midi-chlorians in his blood, Anakin had the potential to become the most powerful Force-sensitive being in the galaxy. The Force was strong in Anakin's bloodline, passing down to his progeny, the twin siblings Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, as well as Ben Solo, Organa's son and the last Skywalker in the direct line."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Skywalkers were living on the desert planet Tatooine as slaves of the Toydarian junk dealer Watto when they encountered Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn in 32 BBY. Intrigued by Anakin's origins and raw connection to the Force, Jinn sought to have him trained in the Jedi arts. After gaining his freedom, Anakin left his homeworld in the Outer Rim Territories to begin his new life at the Jedi Temple on the Core World Coruscant, the capital of the Galactic Republic. As a Jedi Knight, he gained the reputation of a war hero while fighting in the Clone Wars. Although he became one of the strongest members of the Jedi Order, his fear of loss left him susceptible to the dark side of the Force. After his mother's death in 22 BBY, he vowed to not lose another loved one. In 19 BBY, Anakin foresaw that his secret wife, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, would die in childbirth. Determined to learn the power of immortality, Anakin pledged his life to the teachings of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. The newly christened Darth Vader spearheaded the Great Jedi Purge. While most Jedi were executed under Order 66, Vader was defeated by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi who left his former Padawan for dead on Mustafar. Sidious had his Sith apprentice reconstructed as a cyborg, but Amidala died of a broken heart caused by her husband's deeds. The New Order rose to power across the galaxy, and Vader embraced his role as a Sith Lord during his Sith Master's reign as Emperor of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unknown to Vader, his children survived their mother's death.

During the Galactic Civil War, the Skywalker twins emerged as members of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Vader attempted to turn Luke to the dark side by revealing the secret of his parentage to him. Luke, however, believed that his father could be turned back to the light side of the Force. During the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, Vader sacrificed his life in order to save his son from Sidious.

During the New Republic Era, Ben was trained as a Jedi by his uncle, but like his grandfather, the dark side seduced him from the light. Adopting the persona of Kylo Ren, he assassinated his new master, Supreme Leader Snoke, subsequent to killing his father in 34 ABY. Though disillusioned with the Jedi, Luke passed on their teachings to a final student, the scavenger Rey, before sacrificing his life for the Resistance in 34 ABY. As Ren stood poised to rule the galaxy as Supreme Leader of the First Order, Organa died while calling her son back to the light. The persona of Kylo Ren was destroyed, and Ben Solo stood with Rey against her grandfather, the resurrected Darth Sidious, during the Battle of Exegol. The Emperor was destroyed again, but Solo also died in order to save Rey with whom he shared a unique Force-bond, making them a dyad in the Force.

Removed from her homeworld, Shmi was sold in a marketplace similar to the Zygerrian slave market. From there, she was moved from one star system to the next, serving several masters before ending up on the barren planet of Tatooine. By then, Shmi's parents were no longer part of her life. She was alone by the time she was sold to the Hutt gangster Gardulla Besadii the Elder.

In addition to being a gifted engineer, Anakin's raw strength with the Force allowed him to \"see things before they happened,\" granting him heightened reflexes despite his lack of Jedi training. As a result, he was the only human on Tatooine who was capable of competing in a podrace in which the other contestants were aliens.

Despite his inability to leave Tatooine due to his status as a slave, Anakin once declared that he would be the first person to see every star system in the galaxy. Longing for freedom, he dreamed about becoming a Jedi and liberating the slaves of his homeworld. Anakin possessed very limited information about the Jedi during his early childhood, and what little he knew about them came from bedtime stories told by his mother.

Learning about Jinn's situation, Anakin vowed to help his new friends. He suggested entering his custom-built podracer in the Boonta Eve Classic, knowing that the winnings would be more than adequate to purchase the spare starship parts that Jinn's group required.

He questioned Shmi about the identity of her son's father, given how powerfully attuned he was to the Force, and discovered that Anakin never had a father.

Jinn did not believe in accidents or coincidence; as such, he believed that the Force meant for him to find Anakin so that he could be trained in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. He used the Boonta Eve Classic as an opportunity to free Anakin by convincing Watto to wager his slave against the podracer that Anakin would pilot in the race.

Anakin readily agreed, but his decision forced him to leave behind his mother whom he missed. Bearing an attachment to Shmi, Anakin vowed to return and free his mother, but Shmi encouraged him to go with Jinn and never look back. Although she loved her son, Shmi did not want to hold Anakin back from pursuing his dreams. She believed it was his destiny to become a Jedi.

Mortally wounded in a lightsaber duel against the Sith Lord Darth Maul during the Battle of Naboo, Jinn's dying wish was for Anakin to be trained so that he could fulfill his destiny as the Chosen One. Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi vowed to fulfill his master's final request and, having gained the rank of Jedi Knight, he took Anakin as his apprentice with the approval of the High Council.

Knowing neither why he dreamed of her nor the meaning behind them, Anakin grew tired with fatigue. He confided his dreams about his mother to Kenobi who told him that they would fade in time. By then, the High Council had given them an assignment to protect Senator Amidala in the wake of an assassination attempt against her in 22 BBY.

As a result, the Jedi weapon was carried into battle by Rey's friend, Finn, a rogue stormtrooper who used it against other troopers of the First Order.
