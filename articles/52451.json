Tark owned three durnis and worked hard for years to train them as racing durnis. However, circa 1 ABY, the durnis were stolen by the criminals of the Chirq Council and held captive in a bunker near the city of Doaba Guerfel. Galvain Tark thus hired a spacer to recover the animals. The spacer infiltrated the bunker successfully and managed to liberate the three durnis and bring them back to their master."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Galvain Tark was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.
