Amidst the pan-galactic Clone Wars between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Katan pledged her loyalty to the radical Mandalorian splinter group known as the Death Watch, faithfully serving the group's leader Pre Vizsla as a trusted lieutenant. Ironically, she was also the sister of Duchess Satine, whom the Death Watch sought to usurp multiple times. After Vizsla was killed by Darth Maul, who claimed the title of Mandalore, Bo-Katan led a splinter group of Death Watch loyalists."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A female Mandalorian, Bo-Katan was the sister of Satine Kryze, the Duchess of Mandalore and the leader of the New Mandalorians. Bo-Katan worked as a lieutenant for the Death Watch leader Pre Vizsla during the Clone Wars. At one point, while on Carlac, she met with the Separatist-affiliated Lux Bonteri, who brought along a close acquaintance and fake betrothed, Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano. Katan, suspicious of Tano, immediately commented on how skinny Tano was for someone betrothed (engaged) and thus slapped Tano's backside to make a point of it. After the Padawan and Bonteri turned against them, Katan helped chasing the two, while the other members of Death Watch got rid of the droids who helped the young escapees."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "New allies"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Clone Wars scorched on in the galaxy, Pre Vizsla and Katan found an escape pod containing the two Sith Force-sensitive Zabrak brothers known as Darth Maul and Savage Opress who were knocked out after the Skirmish on Florrum. Vizsla and Katan later brought the brothers back to their camp on Zanbar for repairs. Once Maul had awaken, he showed aggression to the Death Watch members when Katan threatened him by pointing her blaster towards Savage if he tried anything to harm them. The brother and Vizsla later gradually introduced each other then later swapped stories on how they came to where they are. Both Death Watch and the brothers later found that they had a common enemy in Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. Vizsla invited Maul for a tea in his tent, where he told Maul the plans of taking over Mandalore. When Maul said it was will of the the Force which made them meet, Katan pointed out her scepticism in allying with the Sith, saying that the Sith brothers are no better than Count Dooku, who once betrayed them. She also said that the brothers are weak, as they were \"put together\" by the Death Watch after Kenobi defeated them on Florrum. Maul got angry on hearing it, and started choking Katan, saying that they will defeat all the pacifist Mandalorians, Dooku and all other common enemies. After it, he released Katan, who smirked at Vizsla. The Sith brothers later aligned themselves to Death Watch to help them liberate Mandalore from Satine Kryze."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mission to Mustafar"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After pointing out that the Death Watch warriors were not yet ready to takeover Mandalore, Maul suggested enlisting the help of the Black Sun who were located at Mustafar to begin creating an army.

After the death of the Black Sun leaders, Maul gave the opportunity to join them to Ziton Moj, who carefully chose to help them embark on their campaign to Mandalore.

After negotiations have failed, bounty hunters pursued the brothers and Vizsla outside where Bo-Katan and her Nite Owls were awaiting the return of them. While Katan and her warriors fought on The Hutt guards, Maul, Vizsla and Savage faced off Sugi and Embo. After the fight had cleared up, the bounty hunters managed to get away safely with minor injuries. The Death Watch warriors were then able to capture a member of the Hutt Council who was left behind known as Oruba.

However, outside the castle Vizsla told Katan to be aware, as they are going to take over Mandalore and they would finish with Maul and Opress."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Takeover of Sundari"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Shadow Collective was at its full potential, Maul and Death Watch advised a plan to turn the people of Mandalore to Pre Vizsla that instructed the crime gangsters to attack several locations around the New Mandalorian capital city of Sundari, including the shipping docks and the Mandalore Banking Center. Then, Death Watch would come in and stop the vile thugs and claim Mandalore for themselves in order to gain the trust of the people. After the plan had gone underway, Vizsla alongside Katan approached Satine while she tried to calm the people. After gaining support from the people, Death Watch began to capture the attackers.

After witnessing the death of her former leader, Katan refused to serve under the clutches of Maul, an outsider, and took a few still-loyal soldiers including her Nite Owls and fought against the traitors.

Unfortunately, Satine was soon recaptured, and it was revealed that Maul allowed her to escape so that she would contact Obi-Wan Kenobi for help. As Mandalore was a neutral planet, the Jedi Order had no jurisdiction so he would be forced to come alone. Bo-Katan watched as Kenobi arrived and rescued Satine from prison yet again, only to be stopped and captured along with her. After Maul killed Satine, she rescued Kenobi as he was being taken to prison, and they and the Nite Owls fought their way to a Kom'rk-class fighter/transport. Bo-Katan told Kenobi to go to the Republic for help, because, with the Sith involved, it was now a Republic matter. When he mentioned that the Republic would invade, she replied, \"Mandalore will survive. We always survive.\" Kenobi deduced that Satine was Bo-Katan's sister and gave her his condolences before flying away."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bo-Katan was a confident and brave woman and a fierce warrior. Proud to serve the Death Watch and its goals of restoring the glory of the Mandalorians' past, Katan was steadfast in her loyalty to both the group and it's leader, Pre Vizsla, who in turn trusted Katan to lead and act as an enforcer in his absence. Her loyalty was shown after the takeover of Sundari, when Vizsla was killed by Maul, she collected the still-loyal members of Death Watch, and joined forces with Obi-Wan Kenobi, in order to gain back what was taken away by the Sith brothers. Despite being on opposing sides, Katan apparently still loved her sister Satine, and showed sadness when Kenobi expressed his condolences at her death. She believed that the Sith and Jedi were equally bad and that there was no difference between them, though this viewpoint may have changed when Obi-Wan Kenobi sided with her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bo-Katan was also able to withstand heavy physical punishment, as shown when she was choked for half a minute by Darth Maul, but when released, she just smirked at Vizsla, after she told Maul straight what she thought about the Sith in general, also showing her plain-spoken personality."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a leader of Nite Owls, she always tried to help out the rest of Death Watch, making victory the first goal.

The unique visor was also outlined with a white trim that, together with the detailing of the surrounding face of the helmet, was reminiscent of a stylized predatory bird, likely a reference to her affiliation, the Nite Owls. Katan's armor was equipped with numerous mounted weapons, including dart launchers, blasters, and blades encased within her gauntlets.
