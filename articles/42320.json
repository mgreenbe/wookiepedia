Later known as the Eradicator network, it included cells on a number of planets, such as Tholatin, Molavar, Balmorra, Alderaan, Tatooine, and Nar Shaddaa. The Balmorran resistance had ties to the network, and the ghost cell was one of the network's training cells. VerveGen Corporation was purchased to serve as a front company for the group to procure Cyclone, and House Cortess was one of the group's backers. The network was eventually defeated by Cipher Nine and its plans for the Eradicators were averted."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
