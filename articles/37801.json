A stilt-city built high above the surface of the planet on elevated platforms, the city's foundations were laid down in a large cove on the eastern coast of the Crystal Sea. Using Dewbright as a center for clean-up efforts on the planet in response to the devastation wrought by the many wars that plagued the planet over its history. Using boats to trust the sea and its tributaries to reach restoration sites across the planet, the Ithorians and other citizens worked to clean-up the debris left by the New Sith Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
