In a matter of hours, she was re-captured by Talas Piran, leader of the Mytaranor Slaving Council. Piran, however, decided to keep her instead of returning her, thinking that the resourceful fugitive could be a useful addition to the Council. L'andara began helping the Council in business transactions with Twi'lek slavers; she usually behaved seductively with male Twi'leks before they became stubborn.
