These emplacements were armed with two heavy laser cannons for use against heavy armor, alongside another two medium laser cannons for additional firepower. The emplacement itself had viewports for troops to fire out of, or gather visual data for the gunners to aim and fire. The V-120 was used against the First Order during their attack on Crait, providing covering fire for the Resistance's counterattack against the First Order. They were later destroyed after multiple attack runs against the outpost's defensive line."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
