Elder Tromak later divulged the location of the relic to Krix Kamerat in order to keep the information safe from the Nihil. However, Kamerat betrayed Tromak and shared the information with Eye of the Nihil Marchion Ro. Tromak managed to escape the Nihil, and approached Jedi Grand Master Yoda for assistance retrieving the relic from Vrant Tarnum before the Nihil could get it. However, Ro and Kamerat got there first, leading to Yoda and Tromak's starship being shot down and the Grand Master going missing. Ro set up a Nihil base at the ruins, which was later investigated by a Jedi team shortly before the Nihil attacked Valo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vrant Tarnum, a terrestrial astronomical object, was located in the far reaches of the Stygmarn system.

The complete relic was a weapon which controlled the Great Leveler, a creature designed to attack Force-sensitives. The Leveler was buried in ice on the planet Rystan, and the locations of the two pieces of the control rod were kept secret to all but the Council of Elders."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the Nihil, a dangerous pirate group, were formed from part of the Elders of the Path as a \"sickness\" within the larger organization. They came under the control of Marchion Ro, the Eye of the Nihil, who had designs upon the group and wished to gain control of the Leveler in order to wreak revenge upon the Jedi Order and Galactic Republic. Having already acquired half of the control rod, Ro sought the location of the other piece, and to that end arrived on Trymant IV to collect Elder Tromak from Bralanak City in the midst of an Emergence of hyperspace debris from the Great Hyperspace Disaster, which Ro had also caused."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ro successfully extricated Tromak, as well as his \"assistant\" Krix Kamerat, from Trymant despite the arrival of a Jedi team led by Grand Master Yoda which had arrived to assist with the disaster and had fought Ro's forces. However, due to the sacred nature of the knowledge, Tromak refused to share the artifact's whereabouts with Ro. Hoping to loosen the Gran's tongue, Ro ordered him and Kamerat thrown into a death match onboard the arena of the Gaze Electric. Having raised Kamerat, Ro decided to share the artifact's location in strict confidence, asking him to keep it secret if Tromak died. However, when Ro stopped the match because he had discovered a holoprojector Yoda had given Kamerat to speak with his former friend Zeen Mrala, as it had a homing beacon inside it, Kamerat betrayed Tromak by claiming that the device was his, although Ro saw through the ruse and persuaded the boy to assist in laying a trap for the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite being ordered fed to the bogaranths, Tromak managed to escape the Nihil on the moon Quantxi, and encountered Jedi Masters Yoda, Torban Buck and Kantam Sy while they were searching for their wayward Padawans, who had gone to fight the Nihil. Although he strongly distrusted the Jedi, due to the gravity of the situation, Tromak privately asked Yoda to come with him to retrieve the artifact, stating that the matter was even more urgent after he learned from Yoda that the Nihil already had the other half, which Yoda had seen onboard the pirates' starship. As per Tromak's request, Yoda left his comlink behind and did not tell anyone where he was going."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kamerat, however, had told Ro where the artifact was hidden, and the Nihil reached Vrant Tarnum first. When Yoda and Tromak arrived, their ship was shot down by security drones left in orbit. Ro, meanwhile, entered the Kharvashark Ruins with Kamerat and retrieved the artifact, which he declared the \"missing piece\" he had been searching for. Telling Kamerat that he reminded him of himself, Ro put him in charge of the Nihil outpost he subsequently established at the ruins. Still possessing some care for his former friends, however, Kamerat sent a message to the Elders on Trymant, telling them the Nihil had a base in the Stygmarn system and asking after Mrala's location. As the Force-sensitive Mikkian had gone with the Jedi, the Elders had no answers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some months later, Mrala, Talisola and Sy returned to Trymant for answers about why the Nihil had wanted Tromak. Speaking to Elder Barbatash, they learned about Kamerat's message and where it had been sent from, deciding to check Vrant Tarnum because its remoteness meant Nihil activity could go unnoticed. Linking up with Jedi Knight Vernestra Rwoh and her Padwan Imri Cantaros, the group went to the Stygmarn system in two starships, the Star Hopper and the Varonchagger. While Sy, Mrala, and Cantaros stayed onboard the larger ship to monitor activity on the surface, Rwoh and Talisola took the Varonchagger up close over Vrant Tarnum in search. With Talisola piloting, she and Rwoh flew the Varonchagger over the many canyons that slashed across the surface, passing through a natural rock loop."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two young women dropped low when their sensors picked up a burst of activity, and Talisola hid the Varonchagger behind a rock formation before gliding. Taking a closer look, they saw that the enemy starships were flying in some kind of formation and realized that the Nihil were on the move. Rwoh alerted the Star Hopper, and they saw that the ships were emerging from the Nihil's hidden base. After watching the ships depart on their mounted Path-jumper engines, Talisola and Rwoh received a message forwarded through the Starlight Beacon which revealed that the Nihil intended to attack Valo, site of the Valo Republic Fair. The Varonchagger and Star Hopper departed Vrant Tarnum for Valo immediately."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Locations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Kharvashark Ruins, the hiding place of part of the rod that controlled the Great Leveler, were located in Vrant Tarnum's southern hemisphere.
