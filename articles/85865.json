Around 0 BBY, Malinth held the rank of Fleet Commander and was stationed on the Outer Rim planet Honoghr, the homeworld of the Noghri, a species allied with the Empire. During that time, the Zann Consortium, a criminal organization led by Tyber Zann, tried to reestablish its previous dominance of the criminal underworld after the escape of their leader from the Imperial prison on Kessel. To this end, the Consortium tried to get a foothold by gaining influence on Honoghr. Zann sent a team of soldiers, including his second-in-command, Urai Fen, to attack Honoghr and kill Commander Malinth. Upon landing on the planet, Consortium troops engaged the Imperial and Noghri forces in battle, during which Malinth was killed. The Commander's death lessened the Imperial influence on the planet, allowing the Consortium to undermine the Imperial command on Honoghr."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Malinth first appeared in the 2006 video game Forces of Corruption, an expansion for the game Star Wars: Empire at War.
