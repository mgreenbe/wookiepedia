Hera Syndulla is convinced that the station's owner Galus Vez will be able to get the parts that they need. Galus is quick to turn down their request for parts, citing the previous Imperial attention that The Ghost's visits have brought. Galus challenges Hera to a race in Fool's Run, with The Ghost placed as the stakes. Fearing that Galus might turn them over to the Empire if she declines, Hera accepts his conditions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the crew leaves Galus's throne room, Sabine Wren reveals that no one has ever beaten Galus at the Fool's Run course. Kanan Jarrus and Ezra Bridger look on as Hera boards The Ghost and takes her place beside Galus's ship, the Splendour. Galus begins the race with a heavy lead, but Hera is able to use her exceptional piloting skills to navigate a shortcut through an asteroid field. Galus activates several decoy false asteroids to block Hera's path. Kanan and Ezra look on in horror as The Ghost takes damage from the new obstacles. They decide to take matters into their own hands, using the force to move asteroids into Galus's path. He is surprised by this quick change in the course and his ship is badly damaged in an impact.
