He led Squadron Two at the time of the First Corellian Insurrection, in which the CDF space forces joined with the insurgents, while the CDF ground forces formed a loyalist faction. Talpron participated in an elaborate ruse designed to project an image of trustworthiness on the part of the CDF, in which a staged attack upon the Millennium Falcon by Uglies, purported to be space pirates, was to be thwarted by CDF Pocket Patrol Boats. The ruse went awry when Han Solo came out of hyperspace ahead of the designated coordinates."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
