However, when the rebel ship Phoenix Nest made maneuvers to draw out the Interdictor, Admiral Kassius Konstantine ordered his crew to move to intercept against the Grand Admiral's orders. Konstantine's insubordination led to his demise and the destruction of the Interdictor, as Commander Jun Sato changed his ship's course at the last minute and rammed the Phoenix Nest through it, destroying both ships. This allowed Ezra Bridger to escape the blockade and bring back help for the rebels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
