Later known as the Ninth Sister, she became a member of Emperor Palpatine's Inquisitorius program and was trained alongside the Seventh Sister, Fifth Brother, Sixth Brother, and Eighth Brother by the Grand Inquisitor in the Inquisitorius Headquarters on Coruscant. They soon fell under the command of Darth Vader when Darth Sidious introduced the Inquisitorius to Vader, who continued their training in the ways of the dark side of the Force.

Before entering, the Ninth Sister asked Vader why he was investigating this, as there had been many recent Jedi reports that had turned out as misjudgments. She exclaimed that she should have been the one checking it out and sending back a report. Vader told the Ninth Sister that she should be pleased with his assistance and in their following trade of words, she deduced that Vader was there in case they got lucky and found a Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Vader told the Ninth Sister to remain outside the bar unless he called upon her. However, once Vader entered the bar, a family of bounty hunters attacked the Dark Lord. They had taken a bounty on Vader unknowingly placed by someone from the very heart of the Republic Executive Building on Coruscant. They set off an ion grenade and destroyed Vader's lightsaber, leading Vader to contact the Ninth Sister to request her to bring him her lightsaber. The Ninth Sister, however, ignored the call, blaming the ion pulse for frying her comm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the family was forced to withdraw from the fight as their ray shields would eventually run out, and Vader was killing even the patrons of the bar to prevent them from attacking him. As the family fled the bar, they held the Ninth Sister at blaster point until Ramat Cha acquired and started up a speeder. As the family escaped, Vader arrived and accused the Ninth Sister of attempting to have him killed. The Ninth Sister told Vader that she had not been the one to place the bounty, suggesting to Vader that one of the other Inquisitors may have done so. Vader ordered the Ninth Sister to remain outside the bar until he returned from dealing with the bounty hunters and told the Ninth Sister that he would kill her if she attempted to flee."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She then traveled with Vader back to Coruscant aboard his ship, when their transmitter was jammed, halting their ability to send clearance codes to the surface. This caused Coruscant's defenses to mobilize and fire missiles at their ship. The Ninth Sister was unable to shake them off and Vader took control of the ship. They were hit by one of them, and they managed to crash land on Coruscant. Vader then ordered Ninth Sister to stay with the ship whilst he dealt with the matter at hand.

Their objective was to investigate whether a possible Jedi had been influencing King Lee-Char's negotiations with the Empire and with them they took fourteen Purge Troopers. Upon their arrival at Dac City, Ninth Sister was confronted by the king's Chief of Security, Gial Ackbar. Ackbar asked of their business and Ninth Sister gave him a writ that legally protected the Inquisitors from harm. Ackbar told her it was an outrage and she told him to take it up with Vader as he approached them. Ackbar continued questioning for their business on Mon Cala until Vader told him they were searching for a possible enemy of the Empire on Mon Cala. Ackbar denied the possibility but as he said that, a shuttle carrying the ambassador exploded, killing all on board.

The Mon Calamari Guard began defending their cities. The Ninth Sister fought them on the landing pad at Dac City where they secured the area.

She then asked him if why they would find the Jedi there, to which Vader said they were there for Lee-Char, hoping they could obtain the Jedi's location from him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After slaying the guards, they entered the palace and took Lee-Char prisoner. Ninth Sister then interrogated him for the location of the Jedi. Before long, a school of large creatures rose through the sea level, generating a wave large enough to rip through the city.

As they marched down the corridors, Vader received a transmission from Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, with a request to capture the King in return for a favor at some later date. Vader acquiesced and ordered the rest of the squad to continue as planned while he went to find the King. The Inquisitors did as instructed and continued to find the Jedi and his last two disciples at a dead end.

The Ninth Sister rebuffed all of this saying that their past no longer affected them. Barr stated otherwise, saying that despite their turn to the dark side they were still Jedi underneath. Barr then used a mind trick on the clones, telling them to execute Order 66."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Barr's mind trick worked and the clones turned on the three Inquisitors. After Tenth Brother was shot fatally in the chest, Barr Force jumped over the fight between the Inquisitors and clones with his acolyte Verla escaping through the only exit.

As the two began to make their way out, Sixth Brother betrayed Ninth Sister, severing her leg and leaving her behind as a distraction for the remaining clones so he could escape. As the Sixth Brother ran off mockingly wishing her good luck, Ninth Sister swore she would get her revenge on him.

She told them of the Jedi fugitive and threatened the execution of the whole group if the Jedi was not turned over. As the Purge Troopers took aim at the Scrappers, the Abednedo Prauf spoke out, shaming the Empire as a whole for overworking the Scrapper Guild. The Second Sister then killed Prauf, and his friend Cal Kestis reacted by trying to cut her down with his lightsaber, revealing himself as the Jedi. She blocked the Jedi's attack and lifted him with the Force, throwing him to the Ninth Sister. The Ninth Sister then held him above a ledge, proclaiming that she found the Jedi, before Cal ignited his lightsaber causing her to drop him in surprise."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kestis, however, survived the fall and landed onto another train.

The Ninth Sister told the Grand Inquisitor that she did not think Kestis would return to the world. She was proven wrong when Kestis began climbing the Origin Tree there. The Ninth Sister, in her ship, confronted him at the tree, expressing her feelings of his return to Kashyyyk. She then proceeded to chase him in her ship, shooting at the Jedi padawan periodically.

However, Kestis soon slashed the Ninth Sister in the left leg and arm, causing her to cry out in pain and ignite her second blade. After the two fought some more, Kestis was able to cut off her right hand, disarming her. Using the force originating from her caterised wounded hand to hold her lightsaber, stating that the Inquisitiors were trained in special abilities. The Ninth Sister continued to fight Kestis, expressing her wish for Kestis to undergo the same torture that she and the other former Jedi endured to become an Inquisitor. As she grew more angry, Kestis outmaneuvered her and slashed her back.
