Talzin was able to use ichor to create a goblet of blackroot. Soaking a kyber crystal in the ichor perverted its connection to the Force, and create a Tainted Nightsister Crystal. These crystals, if used in a lightsaber-like weapon, emitted a green smoke when active. Talzin was able to produce a sword out of ichor that she used to duel Jedi Master Mace Windu."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
