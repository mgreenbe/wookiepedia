During the last years of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire, she worked as a prison guard at a One Sith-run labor camp on the planet Drash-so. While working as a prison guard, she developed a reputation for her brutality and cruelty, and wielded a laser whip. At some point, she came into contact with Ania Solo, a descendant of the smuggler Han Solo. Ania and her lover Ramid attempted to escape the prison camp. While Ania succeeded in escaping offworld, Ramid was recaptured."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unwilling to report her failure to her Sith superiors, she instead assumed Ania's identity. Following the defeat of the One Sith, the labor camp was liberated by the Fel Empire. Due to her stolen identity, the guard was able to evade prosecution for her crimes. At some point, she encountered the Imperial Knight Teemen Alton and murdered him. Since she had stolen Ania's identity, the Galactic Federation Triumvirate believed that Ania had committed the crime. After Ania resurfaced following the Carreras Incident, the Triumvirate placed her on their Most Wanted list in 139 ABY.

After shaking him off, the bounty hunter advanced on Ania, but the latter managed to snag the remote for her TIE/sa bomber, causing it to crash into the bounty hunter and killing her.

At some point, she lost her left hand and obtained a prosthetic hand that was capable of linking to her laser whip. During her stint as a prison guard, she encountered Ania Solo, a descendant of Han Solo, who had been sent to the labor camp with her lover Ramid for murder. Ania recalled that the guard regularly beat and tortured her.

After learning that Ania had traveled to the Carreras system following her prison break-out, she visited Ania's abandoned junkyard on Carreras Minor's moon.

However, Ania was instead kidnapped by her old lover Ramid, who had a grudge against Ania for leaving him for dead during their escape attempt from Drash-so. Ramid intended to collect the Triumvirate bounty on her head. Ramid and his crew ended up on a barren planet that rained acid and glass. While entering the planet's atmosphere, they were pursued by the masked bounty hunter, who had by then procured an antique Imperial TIE bomber.

After sending a medical droid to tend to the wounded Ramid, Ania exited Ramid's starship and open fire on her pursuer, knocking her out with a blast to the head.

During the journey, Ania denied killing the Imperial Knight on the grounds that she had been caught so easily. However, her captor retorted that Ania had shot her in the head, which did not make her sympathetic to her cause. The bounty hunter then used her remote to summon her TIE bomber. Ania attempted to taunt her captor for being a lone wolf but the bounty hunter would have none of her banter. Before the bounty hunter could take Ania away in her transport, Ania's old lover Ramid resurfaced on his speeder bike and rescued Ania.

She then proceeded to strangle Ramid, who tried to disable her prosthetic hand with his knife. However, the bounty hunter proved stronger and succeeded in breaking Ramid's neck.
