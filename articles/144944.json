It was located two-thirds of the way down the Grand Promenade. A pedestal there held a Toydarian noble helmet concealing a control pad for lowering and raising the vault. The room was fifteen-meters square and ten-meters tall. Transparent panels wrap around it allowing those outside to see inside, but not touch it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
