Serving under Kes Dameron, Tyrell participated in the Battle of Endor as part of the Rebel forces deployed to the moon of Endor in order to destroy the shield generator bunker providing protection for the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station in orbit. The bunker and Death Star were both successfully destroyed, and following the end of the battle the Pathfinders spent the night celebrating their victory. Tyrell, who had been wounded in the battle, was approached by Dameron's wife Shara Bey during the celebrations and flirted with her as she asked where Dameron was. Before Tyrell could reply, Dameron interrupted, giving Tyrell a medkit and scolding him for flirting. The next morning the Pathfinders joined General Han Solo in capturing an Imperial holdout on the other side of Endor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tuck Tyrell first appeared in the comic book Shattered Empire 1 which was written by Greg Rucka and released in 2015 with illustrations by Marco Checchetto."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
