When attached to the exterior of a starship, it could cut through the hull of another ship, allowing the crew of the former ship access to the latter ship. In 16 ABY, the portside escape pod of the YT-1300 light freighter Millennium Falcon was replaced with a hull-cutting ring, which was utilized during a mission to the Koornacht Cluster. After the Falcon landed on the side of the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Pride of Yevetha, the hull-cutting ring cut through the Star Destroyer's hull and allowed the Falcon's Wookiee crew access."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
