In 1 ABY the journalist asked a spacer on the streets of Tyrena to visit the Imperial Stronghold on Corellia. She couldn't visit the base herself, as the Empire was aware of her activities and didn't allow her to get near the stronghold. She uploaded the stronghold's coordinates to the spacer's datapad, hoping that she could use the adventurer's observations in future news stories."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The excited journalist is a Non-Player Character (NPC) in Sony Online Entertainment's MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies.
