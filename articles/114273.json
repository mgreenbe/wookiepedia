Although the agency existed prior to the Great War's initiation in 3681 BBY, as a monitoring and decryption arm of the Senate Library, the rapid expansion of the conflict prompted the Galactic Senate to shift the group from a small-scale decryption agency to a full-fledged information and espionage bureau."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The SIS was much younger, smaller, and was stretched thinner than its intelligence counterpart in the Sith Empire, yet it served efficiently during the Great War and the subsequent Cold War. In 3643 BBY, under the direction of Marcus Trant, Agent Theron Shan undertook a mission to the Vesla system to find and gain information about the Sith Empire from Jedi Master Ngani Zho. In the process, Shan discovered the Empire's secret warship builder, the Sun Razer, designed by Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Mekhis. Shan destroyed the Sun Razer and the resulting political fallout pushed the Republic and Empire ever closer to a renewed, full out war. The agency was also called in to investigate the theft of secret plans for the Republic's superweapon, the Planet Prison. Through the investigation, the plans were recovered and the designer of the superweapon, Doctor Tarnis, was revealed to be a Sith Lord. With this, other secret Republic research such as the Power Guard Project were put at risk and the SIS and Jedi moved to secure the projects from Sith control."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Overview"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic Strategic Information Service was an espionage agency of the Galactic Republic. Though it was smaller and younger and managed a smaller network of spies and informants than its intelligence counterpart in the Sith Empire it was still deemed to be an effective intelligence service. Serving as an agency with the Senate Library before the Great Galactic War, the SIS was charged by the Galactic Senate with monitoring and decryption duties. With the outbreak of war, the agency was responsible for providing intelligence to the Republic Military and the Jedi Order. By the end of the war and the start of the Cold War, its duties included the management of networks, counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence, military intelligence, and assisting local law enforcement agencies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The SIS was headquartered in the Heorem Complex on Coruscant and was led by the Director of SIS who would have several agents on special assignments answer directly to him.

Before that, Republic Intelligence had been in operation during the Mandalorian Wars then later disbanded, yet the SIS continued to be known as Republic Intelligence. Years before the war, Republic scientists discovered an ancient Rakatan prison complex on the planet Belsavis and, during several secret sessions, the SIS decided to convert the complex into a new detention facility, to be used to house dangerous prisoners whose execution was not possible or simply impractical."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the emergence of the Sith Empire and the outbreak of war, the Senate removed the agency from the Senate Library and expanded its duties. Due to its small size and relative newness, the SIS lacked the large network or bureaucracy that its Sith counterpart possessed. This became both an advantage and a disadvantage. The SIS had little oversight systems to worry about yet it remained within its legal boundaries even as it sought loopholes around it and ethical boundaries as evident when imprisoning the Cathar hero Prince Shange. However, the agency had a hard time penetrating the Sith Empire. Following its emergence as an intelligence bureau, conspiracy theorists claimed the SIS was the Republic's thirtieth or fortieth attempt at an espionage agency, a theory not far from the truth."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3661 BBY on Belsavis, the Cathar hero Prince Shange opposed the Cathar's joining the Republic. Needing the Prince quieted, SIS operatives abducted him and his followers and took him to the Belsavis prison and placed them in stasis. During several confrontations with the Empire, Republic warships went missing with their crew overcome by some unknown terror. SIS listing posts in the Outer Rim were able to intercept coded messages referring to these incidents and to a group of Sith Lords known as the Dread Masters. With the information in hand, Jedi Knight Jaric Kaedan and a team of Republic Special Forces troopers were able to infiltrate the Imperial dreadnaught and capture the Sith Lords. The Masters were then taken for internment to The Tomb prison complex on Belsavis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During Hylo Visz's attack on the Mandalorian blockade of the Hydian Way, the SIS was informed of the battle and scrambled starfighters to aid the smuggler in her mission to break the blockade for the Republic. The battle was a victory for Visz and the Republic, and the Rimma Trade Route was once again open for the transportation of goods and military wares.

In Anchorhead on Tatooine, the SIS was able to establish a spy network. At the same time, however, an SIS station on Nar Shaddaa was shut down and rumors of Imperial mobilization in that area were increasing. Consequently every lead was vital. When Ngani Zho, a great Jedi warrior who had disappeared after the war, was spotted near the Imperial border, the SIS took immediate interest. Discovering that Zho had claimed to have returned from the Vesla system, a \"Black Sector\" ceded to the Empire as part of the treaty, the SIS sent several agents to investigate hoping to gain knowledge from Zho's time behind enemy lines. However, none of the SIS agents returned. In the aftermath of the Treaty of Coruscant, the SIS became spread thin. The Director was under pressure not only to find information on the Sith but he also had a bounty placed on his head and his ex-wife was under investigation by the Senate. Needing new leads into Imperial Intelligence, the SIS director decided to send Agent Theron Shan to find Zho and discover his knowledge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After several weeks, Shan, along with a female Twi'lek criminal named Teff'ith that Shan had picked up on Coruscant, was able to track down the missing Jedi Master Zho on Taris. The three were followed and attacked by Sith Knights under the control of Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Mekhis. They managed to defeat the Knights and escape Taris. Shan then questioned Master Zho on his experiences in the Vesla system. Except for knowing that the system was under the control of Darth Mekhis and that she was constructing horrible weapons, the old Jedi was not able to remember much of what happened. He was insistent though that Darth Mekhis must be stopped. Shan consulted with the SIS Director and learned that the Sith Empire had shut down an SIS station on Nar Shaddaa and there were rumors that the Imperial Guard was mobilized. Feeling the need to press their advantage then, the SIS Director authorized Shan to investigate the activity within the Vesla system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After securing clearances and navigation charts at Port Nowhere, Shan and his team entered the Vesla system and set up an observation post with telescopes and a spy ray developed by SIS scientist Dr. Nasan Godera. Several days later the planet's rotation allowed Shan to view the other planets in the system. He was able to see Darth Mekhis's shipyard that was fueled by the Sun Razer, which used the energy of the system's sun to create a new and experimental class of warship called the Javelin Dreadnought. The warship was capable of using its weapons to flash irradiate a planet's surface from space, wiping out all life below within a three kilometer radius. Shan recorded the information and attempted to leave the system with his companions; however, they were spotted and captured by the Imperial Navy dreadnaught Valor Prevails under the command of Captain Eisek."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Taking action"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When they were captured, Shan was taken on a tour of the facilities by Captain Eisek while Master Zho was placed under interrogation. During this, Zho revealed his adventures and how he had slipped into the slave labor force the Empire was using to build the Sun Razer so that Zho could investigate the Vesla system. After the tour, Shan was taken to the same room as Zho and placed in restraints. Darth Mekhis then ordered the execution of Zho but before that could be carried out, Shan was able to free them both from the restraints. They then met up with Teff'ith to plan their next move. Instead of attempting to leave again and report to the SIS, Shan decided to destroy the Sun Razer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shan then made his way to the control center in order to bring down the shields of the facility thereby destroying it by exposing it to sun. Meanwhile Teff'ith and Zho made their way towards the hangar and engaged in a fire fight with Imperial forces to distract from Shan's goal. Teff'ith and Zho had made it to the hangar, however, Zho was killed by Imperial troopers when he pushed Teff'ith out of the line of fire. Meanwhile, Shan entered the control center and found Darth Mekhis there. After fighting with her Sith Knights and other Imperial soldiers and was seemingly captured by them, Shan drew Mekhis closer by revealing his name and claiming to be a Jedi. When Mekhis came closer, Shan shot her with a toxin from his arm. He then killed the other Imperials and lowered the shields of the facilities. Upon reaching his ship, Shan and Teff'ith escaped the explosion and destruction of the Sun Razer and the shipyard. Shan returned to Coruscant and reported to the Director of his activities. Though the Sun Razer and it's surrounding shipyard were destroyed, several of the warships created there were in operation in the Sith fleet and the Director felt that the Cold War was ready to heat up again into full conflict. Shan told the Director his intentions to keep investigating with a special interest in a light-speed cannon that was capable of eliminating hyperspace targets called the Gauntlet."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Coruscant operations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the reconstruction efforts, the Republic government began secretly building weapons in expectation of an inevitable renewed war with the Empire.

Beginning at the SIS base outside of Shadow Town, a Imperial prison camp, the Knight fought to where Galen was located. However, Galen had been turned into a Power Guard cyborg and was slaved to the commands of Sadic through pain infliction. After fighting the Knight, Galen fled to Sadic's lab and attacked the Sith only to be defeated and severely wounded. The Knight also went to Sadic's lab but was able to kill him. Special Agent Tander along with Agent Diyaz and commandos from Black Star Squad destroyed the Power Guard files as well as Sadic's lab and any equipment associated with the project.
