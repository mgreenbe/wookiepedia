Pilots operated their vessels from cockpits, managing a variety of instruments that controlled the vehicle's speed, direction, and other operations. Anakin Skywalker was once ordered to stay in the cockpit of an N-1 starfighter during the Battle of Naboo in order to stay out of harm's way. Skywalker inadvertently flew the craft into battle, however. Although cockpits were normally a part of a vessel's main body, Podracer cockpits were tethered to the engines they controlled via cables.
