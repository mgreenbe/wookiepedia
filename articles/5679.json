The Alliance was formed from a less organized movement to oppose the Empire that existed, which was secretly led by Organa. This early group came together from a number of rebel cells, including the crew of the Ghost and the Phoenix Cell.

The Alliance was publicly and formally declared with the Declaration of the Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Alliance and the cells before it were born from the overall discontent within the Empire of those who wished the Old Republic restored.
