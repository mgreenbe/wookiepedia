At this time, the crazed Arkanian mutant, Zeta Magnus had brought a pathogen to Skye and unleashed it on her people, declaring himself Magister in the process. When Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his two Padawans, Anakin Skywalker and Halagad Ventor were brought before the Council to discuss the future of the Tyrant which ruled over them, Thyswar voiced his shock and disdain for Patriarch Klarym\u00e9re's proclamation that the Outland Clans might have a good reason to attack them based on the outdated bylaws that governed S'kytri society. Speaker Neba\u00e9l silenced Thyswar and reprimanded him for speaking out of turn and later granted the Patriarch and the Jedi permission to neutralize the self-appointed Magister."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
