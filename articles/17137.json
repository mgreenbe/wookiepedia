They were connected to a monitoring console beside the vat. Out of the lungs, a black fluid was being siphoned into a series of black tanks nearby. The laboratory was visited by the Imperial Corrections Officer Armitage in 1 BBY while he was attempting to salvage parts to repair the Imperial prison barge Purge. The vat containing the lungs began to emit a loud screaming sound, which deafened Armitage temporarily. When he turned to leave the laboratory, he was ambushed and killed by Blackwing-infected members of the Star Destroyer's crew."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
