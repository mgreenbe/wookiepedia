Admiral Flanken tracked the attacks to the Light Calamari cruiser Lulsla. Flanken ordered Colonel Vistore to send his Assault Gunboats to rally with his own and assault the Rebel starship in a two-phase attack. Before the assault on the Rebel forces, Secret Order agents became curious about the source of all the Imperial equipment that was emerging from Rebel hands, and tasked the Imperial pilots to be on the lookout for additional stolen arms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "First phase"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first phase consisted of Colonel Vistore's Assault Gunboats from D-34 attacking the Lulsla while it was restocking supplies, rallying its starfighter defenses of X-wings, A-wings and B-wings and using transports Leven and Modd to lay a minefield around the ship. Maarek Stele inspected the containers C440 to discover Imperial probes in one of the containers stolen from Outpost D-34. It was believed that the probes were provided by a traitor. After destroying the two transports and destroying all the fighters that the Gunboats were dogfighting, the second wave arrived to destroy all the containers and effectively cut off the supply lines. Stele assisted with the second wave and inflicted heavy starfighter casualties in the process. With the supplies and most of the Rebel starfighters destroyed, the Imperials withdrew to regroup for another attack. The Lulsla meanwhile re-laid a large minefield around the cruiser and relayed whatever fighters were left as its last line of defense in preparation for the next phase of the attack. But the commander knew his defenses weren't enough and prepared whatever transports and shuttles he had left for abandoning the ship."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Second phase"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperials prepared a strike force consisting of transports Sigma and Omega armed with rockets along with two squads of Assault Gunboats arrived to destroy the Lulsla. Maarek Stele launched missiles at the Lulsla's warhead launchers, destroying them, and began clearing the minefield while the transports launched their rockets. The gunboats meanwhile made short work of a Y-wing that was launched from the cruiser. After the cruiser suffered heavy hull damage, two groups of two transports Starway and Gargon and two Lambda-class T-4a shuttles Derris were launched from the hangar bay containing most of the crew abandoning the ship. However, the Gunboats destroyed all but the ship's commander's shuttle, disabling it with ion cannons. When it was disabled, transport Zack 1 arrived to board and capture the shuttle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the destruction of the Lulsla and the capture of its commander, the Imperials were soon able to pacify the surrounding systems. As impressive as this accomplishment was, it was also the beginning of Admiral Harkov's defection to the Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the game there are differences based on difficulty level. This battle follows the storylines of both Battle 1 missions 5 and 6, following \"Medium\" difficulty. In Mission 5, the Lulsla is invulnerable and cannot be destroyed. If attacked the Lulsla launches five waves of five A-wings from Gold Squadron and five waves of three A-wings from Yellow Squadron. A \"bonus\" objective in this mission is to destroy five waves of five X-wings from Blue Squadron. This is on all difficulties. In \"Hard\" difficulty, the A-wings in the primary objective increase to three and are designated Red rather than Blue, there are four B-wings instead of two, and the cruiser will launch five waves of three additional X-wings as well as the two squadrons of A-wings to make it more challenging. In mission 6 all but one of the bonus objectives is to destroy all the mines that the Lulsla laid. The last bonus objective is to ensure Zack 1's boarding operation succeeds. In \"Hard\" difficulty, as soon as the Lulsla is attacked it launches three A-wings, X-wings and Y-wings to attack the Gunboats, the player's in particular."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
