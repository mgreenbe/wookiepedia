They could be found swimming in the bodies of water of multiple worlds throughout the galaxy, including Corellia, Dantooine, Dathomir, Endor, Naboo, Rori, Talus, and Yavin 4. They could even be found in the sulfur pools and rivers of Lok, and in the few oases of the desert world of Tatooine. Small and black, with beady dark eyes, one of the blackfish's most distinguishing features were their stripes, which could come in a variety of different hues. By affixing various forms of bait to a fishing pole, including grubs, insects or worms, it was possible for individuals to lure and reel blackfish out of the water through the act of fishing. After being caught, blackfish meat could be used as ingredients in various foodstuffs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the Galactic Civil War, following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, a spacer scoured the galaxy for fish, including a particularly rare variety of blackfish.

With the release of Chapter 7: A Collection of Heroes on November 1, 2007, a collection quest titled The Reel Life was added to the game. To complete this collection, players had to successfully catch seven fish, including a \"Rare Blackfish\" which could be found on any of the original aforementioned worlds. Completing this collection would award the player with the title of \"Novice Angler.\" Although players could choose not to complete this collection, this article assumes 100% game completion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
