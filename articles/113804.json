It was similar in appearance to the Nu-class attack shuttle in use thousands of years later during the Clone Wars. It had a roughly inverted \"V\" shape with two downward sloping wings that would fold upwards when in landing configuration. Its propulsion system consisted of two drive engines and it was armed with at least two forward-mounted laser cannons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lucky Lancer was a Rendaran-class that was widely celebrated for having survived over one hundred combat missions throughout the Great Galactic War."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the signing of the Treaty of Coruscant, the Jedi Master Orgus Din and Lieutenant Harron Tavus were dispatched on a diplomatic mission to Balmorra.
