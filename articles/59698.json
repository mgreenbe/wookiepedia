Consisting of a number of Weequays, the Harlok Gang possessed a small fleet. Shortly after the Battle of Hoth, the Harlok Gang encountered the Millennium Falcon above Tatooine, and, assuming it was being piloted by its owner, the smuggler Han Solo, demanded that the freighter follow their fleet. However, the starship was being flown by Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca on a mission for the Rebel Alliance. Calrissian, as the former Baron Administrator of Cloud City, lied to the Harlok Gang, claiming that he wished to negotiate a deal with Jabba the Hutt. The Harlok Gang agreed to escort Calrissian to Jabba's Palace in exchange for a cut of the supposed agreement."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
