It consisted of a crown of purple leaves sitting on top of a mound of brown roots, and was sturdy enough for an adult human to sit upon. Members of the tee-muss species fed upon the plant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Onderonian Civil War in the year 20 BBY, it could be found growing in the forests surrounding the world's capital city Iziz as well as those close to the camp maintained by the resistance movement fighting in the war. The resistance member Lux Bonteri sat on a purple kings' crown next to the camp while comrade Steela Gerrera treated a wound he had sustained in training. The shrub also grew in the mountain region where the insurgent fort known as the nest was built."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Purple kings' crown first appeared in \"A War on Two Fronts\" the second episode of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television show's fifth season, which aired on October 6, 2012.
