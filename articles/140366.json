Founded by Governor Wilhuff Tarkin, it gave birth to both the first and second Death Star battle stations. Officers within the Initiative, like Director Orson Krennic, were guarded by Imperial Intelligence's death troopers.

The droid, however, was revealed to be homicidal, wiping out everyone at the base and then self-destructing the base itself. At some point before the secret mission to Geonosis, it was found by Doctor Aphra, who, after adjusting the droid's behavior and activating it, put it under the service of Darth Vader. The initiative developed the Hutt clone trooper, though they did not see wide scale deployment and were instead stored aboard Hivebase-1."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The logo of the Tarkin Initiative was a hexagon representing a stylized faceted kyber crystal.
