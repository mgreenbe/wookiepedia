The DCP also provided security for local corporations, such as Shankti Drive Works and Tumleh Navigation. The city's right to maintain its own police force was written into its charter. Historically the city was peaceful, and DCP officers rarely wore armor, but their association with corporations specializing in prototype equipment meant they always had the latest technology available for us."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite this, after it was reported that Demophon's sun was going supernova during the Galactic Civil War, the DCP found itself unable to keep up with the boom in criminal activities. This led them to harsher measures, often shooting first and asking questions later. The departure of DCP officers evacuating the planet only intensified the crisis."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
