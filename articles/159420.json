She became one of the most dangerous members of the group and was amongst its leadership along with the male Human San'sii, who was the Kursk of the Blackguard while she was a member. In 1 ABY during the Galactic Civil War, a Sullustan Archaeologist called Mi Fon Lu wished to carry out research in the Southern Jedi Ruins where the Blackguard were based. Not wanting to be attacked while working there, Fon Lu hired a group of spacers to clear out the ruins and kill all Blackguard inside.
