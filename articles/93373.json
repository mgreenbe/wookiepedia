Han and Qi'ra don't have a lot in common other than not having a lot. They're street kids on the industrial planet Corellia, doing whatever it takes to get by, dreaming of something more. They each jump at a chance to prove themselves in the perilous world of Corellia's criminal underbelly, only to discover they are on the same mission for the same unscrupulous boss. When the job goes disastrously wrong, Han and Qi'ra are on the run\u2013from pirates, a droid crime syndicate, the Empire, and their boss\u2013and will have to learn to trust each other if they are going to survive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Plot summary"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An Imperial engineer created a portable deflector shield, and after she realized the value of her creation, she left the Empire to sell it to the underworld. She organized an auction on Corellia with three factions, the White Worms, the Kaldana Syndicate and the Droid Gotra. Lady Proxima sent both Qi'ra and Han on secret missions to the auction: While Qi'ra went to the Obsidian Room in the Bucket Center to bid, Han went to the Foundry to await the results. However the White Worms' bid was insultingly low, and Qi'ra, afraid she'd be disposed of, set the other bidders against each other, while the Droid Gotra won the bid, however the Kaldana Syndicate then stormed the Foundry to take the plans for the shield, but the Gotra representative, TD-H4, passed the shield plans to Han, while the Kaldana gunned him down. Han and Qi'ra met on the sewers and decide to work together, and after realizing the White Worms would also be after them for their failure, decide to secretly ask Tsuulo for help. They steal Tsuulo's brother's speeder, and escape to Qi'ra's safehouse. Realizing that the only way to be accepted back into the White Worms was to give the plans back to the engineer so she could resell the plans, they returned to the Foundry to get more information on her and found TD-H4, who explained to them the situation. On their way out, they were intercepted by stormtroopers loyal to the engineer, who gave them a way to contact her. On Qi'ra's safe place, they contacted the engineer, and organized for their escape from the planet if they released one of her assets from the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They rescue Kirroo, the engineer's asset, but the plan goes south and they found themselves being chased. The engineer's shuttle rescued them in time and took them to the engineer's ship. They give the plans back to the engineer, and Qi'ra plans to organize a second bid, this time with the help of the White Worms. The engineer accepted, and impressed with Qi'ra, offers her a job working for her. The engineer contacts Lady Proxima and organizes the second auction, hosted by the White Worms for Proxima's contacts, in exchange for 0.65% of profits. This time the Kaldana Syndicate wins, and send their ship to make the exchange, and take Han, Tsuulo, and Qi'ra if she refused the offer. She did, so the engineer warned her that the Kaldana might try to kill them once they had the chance. Once the exchange was effected, however, the Kaldana turned on them. They escaped, but Tsuulo was shot dead before they made it to the escape pod. Once they were out of the Kaldana Ship, the Nimbus Red blew it up as the engineer had been paid by the Droid Gotra to destroy the ship, effectively extinguishing the Syndicate. Han and Qi'ra returned to the White Worms, and after Han told Lady Proxima that Qi'ra rejected the engineer's job offer, Proxima made Qi'ra the new Head. However Han and Qi'ra realized they didn't want to be White Worms anymore and began planning their escape from Corellia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Media"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Editions"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Cover gallery"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bilbiography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
