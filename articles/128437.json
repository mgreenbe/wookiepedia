Belonging to a family of beings who possessed a unique connection to the Force, the Son embodied the dark side whereas his sister was attuned to the light. Their father maintained a delicate balance between his children until his growing infirmities led him to lure Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker to Mortis, hoping that the Chosen One would take his place. The Son, who resented the Father's authority, yearned to escape into the greater galaxy\u2014a goal both the Father and the Daughter were determined to prevent. Intrigued by the potential of the Chosen One, the Son saw Skywalker as the key to his liberation from Mortis and, therefore, sought to turn the young Jedi to the dark side. By corrupting Skywalker's Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, the Son forced a confrontation between the apprentice and her Jedi Master while, at the same time, battling his sister. By then the Son's Force powers had grown stronger with the dark side, allowing him to overpower the Father. However, he inadvertently caused the death of his sister by attempting to kill the Father with the Dagger of Mortis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Son's next attempt to turn Skywalker proved successful; as a result of the Son's powers, Skywalker saw a glimpse of his future as the Sith Lord Darth Vader\u2014a future paved by the fall of the Jedi Order and Darth Sidious' rise to power; the slaughter of Jedi younglings and the death of his wife, Padm\u00e9 Amidala; and his fateful duel on Mustafar with Obi-Wan Kenobi, which would result in Vader's reconstruction as a Sith that was more machine than man. Overwhelmed by the revelation of his fate, Skywalker accepted the Son's offer of an alliance in the hope of altering the future and bringing an end to the Clone Wars. However, the Father interfered with his offspring's plans by erasing Skywalker's memory of the visions.

Unlike his sister, however, the Son aligned himself with the dark side of the Force, acting as the embodiment of selfishness."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Father sought to maintain balance in the Force after realizing his children could rip the very fabric of the universe apart and, together, the Ones retreated to the Wild Space world of Mortis.

During this time, the Son grew tired of waiting to take his father's place, and continued to succumb to the seduction of the dark side.

The signal was received by the Galactic Republic Admiral Nils Tenant, who relayed it to Skywalker and two other Jedi, his Padawan Ahsoka Tano and the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. When Skywalker attempted to rendezvous to the point of the distress signal, he and his Jedi companions instead encountered the Mortis monolith, which blocked their communications and pulled them into the realm of Mortis. There, the Daughter approached the trio and offered to take them to the Father. The Son, however, intervened, causing a rockslide and separating Skywalker from Kenobi and Tano as they traversed a mountainous path. The Daughter ordered the group to wait for her to return, warning them that her brother's work put them all in danger and that they needed shelter before nightfall."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skywalker, however, insisted that Kenobi and Tano return to their shuttle and attempt to send a distress signal, meanwhile he would follow the Daughter. The Son, in cohesion with his father's plan to test if Skywalker was truly the Chosen One, hid away the Jedi's shuttle and confronted Kenobi and Tano when they arrived looking for it. The Force wielder, with curiosity, asked if Skywalker really was the Chosen One, which prompted the two Jedi to draw their lightsabers against him in suspicion. The Son implored the group to wait and told them they could not leave Mortis yet, using the Force to effortlessly deactivate their lightsabers. When Kenobi said to the Son that he was a Sith, the Son replied he both was and was not, and that the Chosen One's test was about to occur regardless of their efforts to stop it, as a thunderstorm began. Before leaving the duo, the Son warned Kenobi and Tano that the storms on Mortis were lethal, forcing them to take refuge in a nearby cave as he shapeshifted into his gargoyle form and flew away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By nightfall, Skywalker had already reached the Father's monastery and had reluctantly remained as his guest, due to the storm outside and having nowhere else to go.

Skywalker, despite being wary of the Son's form, opened up to the Force wielder and admitted that he believed he had failed both Shmi and the Jedi Order when he indulged in vengeance the night his mother died. The Son promised Skywalker that he was destined to become more than a Jedi, but that he could only fulfill his destiny if he renounced his love for Padm\u00e9 Amidala, his wife, whom the Son called the \"poisoner.\" Skywalker, seeing through the Son's form, confronted the Father about seeing his deceased mother, accusing him of being a Sith Lord.

The siblings brought the two Jedi to the monastery arena, where the Father and Skywalker were already waiting. The Father then revealed that Skywalker was to choose which of the two Jedi to save, as the Son and the Daughter had been instructed to kill them both, implying he could only save one. Skywalker refused the ultimatum, however, instead using the Force to overpower both the Son and the Daughter, proving he was, in fact, the Chosen One. After the Son and Daughter were forced to kneel before Skywalker, they both reverted back to their humanoid forms. Following this, the Father informed Skywalker that the Chosen One's destiny was to remain on Mortis to keep the balance between his children, but Skywalker rejected the Father's warning of dooming the galaxy and chose to leave Mortis instead."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Embracing the Darkness"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later that morning, the Son manifested in Skywalker's dream as a mirror image of the young Jedi Knight. During the dream, the Son tried to tempt Skywalker into embracing the dark side and restore balance to the Force. When Skywalker refused and turned away, the Son morphed into the form of a monster and attacked the Jedi, jerking Skywalker awake. Shortly later, before Skywalker and his companions could leave Mortis, the Son entered their ship and kidnapped Ahsoka Tano. He then jumped out of the shuttle and morphed into his gargoyle form, while taking the captive Tano with him. Skywalker and Kenobi pursued the Son in their ship into a canyon of mist-shrouded spires.

After unsuccessfully trying to convince Tano to forget her master, the Son bit her on the arm, infecting Tano with the dark side of the Force.

Touching her forehead, the Son drained her off her life force, causing her to die. Enraged, Skywalker attempted to attack him, but the Son easily repelled him with the Force. The Son then attempted to stab the Father but was blocked by the Daughter, who took the brunt of the blade and was mortally wounded as a result.

There, the Son sought to bring the young Jedi to his side by revealing glimpses of Anakin's future including the death of his secret wife Padm\u00e9 Amidala, the Great Jedi Purge, the rise of Palpatine's Galactic Empire, the destruction of Alderaan and his transformation into Darth Vader. With Anakin overcome by fear and anguish, the Son offered to help him change the future. When Skywalker asked whether they would bring peace, the Son claimed this was so.

The Son then made his way to the monastery where he was confronted by the Father and the three Jedi. The Son proved too powerful for the three Jedi and his weakened Father to overcome. In order to strip the Son of his Force powers, the Father sacrificed his own life by stabbing himself. Shaken by remorse, the Son reconciled with the Father just before he was impaled by Skywalker's lightsaber.

The Son was also capable of conjuring up powerful Force visions, and appearing within Skywalker's dreams. He was also capable of entering physically secure structures, like buildings and starships, unhindered by appearing and disappearing at will without alerting others to his presence. The Son was also able to use telekinesis as well as a powerful Force push. He was also able to use Force speed and can also fly without being in his Gargoyle form. The Son also had the power of Tutaminis, as he was able to turn off the lightsabers of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Ahsoka Tano. One known weapon capable of harming him was the Dagger of Mortis.
