The child of slaves, Spinner was born in the city of Eorm during the Festival of Nida's Rise in 3000 BBY. He was a descendant of an ancient rebel Ermon Parrah who had been cast out from the Tribe and whose descendants had been forced to become lowly weavers and ropemakers. Due to his genealogy, Spinner endured the stigma of being an outcast and was denied any opportunity of social mobility. In his youth, Spinner rebelled against the Tribe's establishment and became an outlaw who perpetrated acts of vandalism and mischief against the state. He even rejected his first name \"Parlan\" and became known as \"Death Spinner\" among both his peers and the public.

While the youth faced capital punishment for his various crimes against the Tribe, Varner showed clemency towards Spinner and decided to give him a second chance as a mariner serving on the exploratory vessel Southern Star. The ship was assigned with exploring the frozen continent of Eshkrene in Kesh's South Pole. While Spinner and Takara were bitter opponents, their paths ultimately crossed again and the two Human found themselves on Eshkrene. Following a scuffle with the ship captain Chegg and his crew, the two Human Sith encountered the Doomed\u2014the descendants of stranded Jedi and Dark Jedi warriors from the Hundred-Year Darkness who had made peace after their actions unleashed the Great Calamity that ravaged much of Kesh and inspired legends of the Skyborn and Destructors amongst the indigenous Keshiri."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Doomed and their S'kytri leader Kaliska took the intruders captive.

Dreypa had also intended to keep Takara as insurance in negotiations but the Sith princess had escaped with Kaliska back to Eshkrene with a large flight of uvaks, winged reptilian steeds indigenous to Kesh. There, the Doomed rallied to stop Dreypa's megalomaniac ambitions. Dreypa's forces retreated to the volcanic crater of Sessal Spire where the Dark Jedi unleashed his pet Leviathans, monstrous serpentine Sithspawn who fed on the life energies of sentient beings.

The Lost Tribe were the descendants of Human Sith slaves from Naga Sadow's Sith Empire that had fled the Great Hyperspace War in 5000 BBY. His ancestor Ermon Parrah had once led a failed attempt to steal the crippled Sith warship Omen and escape into hyperspace. As a punishment, Parrah and his future descendants were enslaved and ordered to spin a chord that would reach the stars in return for being readmitted to the Tribe.

At a young age, he left home and took to living on the streets as an outlaw, an anarchist opposed to the contemporary status quo. As an outcast, Parlan was denied access to education and any other forms of social mobility that would have enabled him to lift his status on Kesh.

Likewise, Spinner rationalized his actions as part of his anarchic guerrilla struggle against the authorities on Kesh.

Prefect Hilts investigated Spinner's involvement in several crimes including an assassination plot against all the Keshiri cake decorators prior to the wedding fete of High Lord Nikoll, and a terror plot to hijack an airship and ram it into the southeastern aqueduct. By 2975 BBY, one of his latest strings of crimes included an attempt to desecrate the Keshiri Burial Cairns beneath the old Circle Eternal.

For centuries, the Lost Tribe had been able to maintain domination over the Keshiri by claiming to be the Skyborn, ancient protectors from the annals of Keshiri mythology who had fought against the evil Destructors. Thus, the Lost Tribe came to occupy a demi-god status among their Keshiri subjects. Officially, Spinner told his fellow gang members in \"Spinner's Web\" that they were only there to create mischief and trouble.

However, Takara ensured that her subordinates did not permanently maim or cripple him because her father Grand Lord Hilts had ordered that he be captured alive and brought into his presence. However, Spinner's accomplices were not so fortunate since the Grand Lord's wife Iliana had ordered their summary execution.

Unlike his Sith compatriots, Hilts believed that time was more valuable than power since nobody had ever broken the chains of time.

The Keshiri were a backward, premodern society that was deeply superstitious. One of their legends described an ancient cataclysm between two powerful series of gods known as the Protectors and Destructors.

Takara then revealed that further investigations had confirmed that \"Death Spinner\" was actually the working-class vagabond and slave Parlan Spinner.

Spinner remained unmoved by Hilt's words and commented that the current political order only benefited the elite while the masses remained powerless. Grand Lord Hilts sensed that Spinner was impatient but reiterated that he could be put to good use. Under the Hilts Restoration, the Grand Lord had commissioned the construction of a new fleet of wooden ships as part of a program to explore new frontiers in the continent of Alanciar.

However, Iliana still distrusted Spinner and told her daughter Takara to kill him if he created trouble again. At that point, Spinner realized that Varner and Iliana Hilts were the parents of Takara. He then expressed his surprise that the daughter of nobles of such high social standing was doing patrol work, which was considered a lowly occupation delegated to Keshiri. Takara then explained that this policy reflected her father's idea that power in the tribe was not hereditary but was rather earned through merit.

As a final parting, Spinner commented that Takara could enjoy being her parent's slave while he would be gaining riches as a mariner. Captain Chegg was a Keshiri, a member of the indigenous species of Kesh that had been subjugated by the Lost Tribe millennia earlier. Chegg was a hard and demanding taskmaster who assigned the young Spinner with the task of manning the ship's sails and rigging. Chegg disdained the arrogant disposition of many of the Human Sith on Kesh and took advantage of Spinner's employment to exploit the young Human.

Despite their initial hostility, Spinner and Takara were destined to cross paths yet again. One day, Spinner was below deck sharpening his daggers when he encountered Takara, who had stowed aboard the ship. She had grown tired of working as a Constable and like Spinner, she wanted to start a new life in Alanciar.

Spinner attempted to speak up for Takara and tried to explain that she was someone important. However, Takara claimed that she was only another passenger. Due to the privileged status of Humans in Keshiri society, Takara insulted the Captain by telling him to watch his mouth since he was a Keshiri. However, Chegg was not amused by the Human girl's recalcitrance and reminded her that the only \"gods\" above his ship were the surveyors and straw bosses on his crew.

Takara responded that her parents would not give her the advantage of her family name and stated that she would thus not use it to her own advantage. Due to his impoverished background, Spinner thought that Takara was wasting her power and privileges. Takara then replied that he could make his own way while she made her own way.

He instructed his men to set up shelters since there was a snow storm approaching. Meanwhile, Spinner and Takara attempted to sneak back aboard the Southern Star but were caught by the crew.

By the climax, he considered accepting Grand Lord Varner Hilts' offer to make him one of the Grand Lord's Hands, an elite secret agent in the service of the Tribe. Despite this, Spinner was still sometimes willing to risk his life to save others.

This cavalier attitude dated back to his prepubescent years when he defaced a statue of the Tribe's founder Yaru Korsin at the age of eleven.

During their adventures, Spinner's relationship with Takara evolved from one characterized by mutual hatred to cooperation when faced with a common foe.

Dreypa also shared Kaliska's assessment that Spinner was an opportunistic individual who could not be trusted. Dreypa was further disgusted that Spinner had risked his own life to rescue his former enemies Takara and Iliana from death.

He along with the Lost Tribe princess Takara Hilts served as one of the two main point-of-view characters. According to Miller's production notes, he envisioned Spinner as a cross between a vandal and a revolutionary with deluded ambitions of being a \"master-criminal.\" Miller also wanted use Spinner's origins as a slave to explore the Human slave caste within the Lost Tribe's society, which served as a control mechanism for recalcitrant members of the Tribe. Miller surmised that Spinner rejected his calling as a slave while the rest of his family kept on weaving even during the dark ages. He also added that Spinner's decision to return to Kesh despite discovering a way offworld was fuelled by a desire to prove to Takara that he was not who she thought he was.
