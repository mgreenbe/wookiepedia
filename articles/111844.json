By 43.5 ABY, she had attained the rank of lieutenant, and was stationed at a secret Galactic Alliance Security blockhouse on the galactic capital of Coruscant. In that year, several Jedi Knights began to develop a psychosis which caused them to believe that everyone they knew had been replaced by impostors. The Galactic Federation of Free Alliances decided to deal with the matter by encasing the afflicted Jedi in carbonite. Two of these Jedi, Jysella and Valin Horn, were placed in the blockhouse in which Ke'e was stationed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around this time a group of Jedi, led by Jedi Knight Jaina Solo, acquired a legal document from Judge Arabelle Lorteli granting them visitation rights to the Horns. They arrived at the blockhouse with the Horns' parents and a large contingent of press. Solo presented the document to Security Captain Atar, who was forced to lead them to a turbolift that would take them to the carbonite-encased Jedi. Ke'e stood outside the turbolift, and Atar ordered that she allow only the Jedi and the Horns' parents through; as well as to check them all for weapons. Ke'e attempted to carry out her orders, instructing Jedi Master Cilghal to wait so that she could be searched, but Cilghal disregarded her request to search her for weapons, claiming she hadn't brought any. Frustrated, Ke'e ordered the rest of the present Security troopers to secure the lobby. She then tried to prevent the press from entering the turbolift, but Solo questioned the lieutenant's ability to stop them and led the reporters into the turbolift. Ke'e then threatened Solo, who disregarded the comment and followed the rest of the Jedi and reporters to the Horns."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rasher Ke'e attempted to follow her orders to the best of her ability and became very frustrated when the Jedi ignored her instructions.
