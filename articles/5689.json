Many of these territories were ruled by warlords who joined the Republic instead of fighting it during the early days of Republic expansion. The rulers of these territories were given the title of Moff or Grand Moff, depending on the size and population of the Region."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Over time, most of the Allied Regions were divided into Republic Sectors and faded away. The Ruusan Reformation did away with the last of the Moffs and Grand Moffs. A millennia later, very few Allied Regions remained by the rise of the Galactic Empire; some managed to hold onto their meager powers, such as the Ollonir Boundaries and the Botor Enclave. In some ways, the Allied Regions were similar to the later Imperial client states."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Known Allied Regions"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
