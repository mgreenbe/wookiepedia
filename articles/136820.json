Originally elected just by the Sullustans, the Council increasingly came under the control of the SoroSuub Corporation. Shareholders gained the right to vote in elections for the Council, even if they were not Sullustans or on Sullust. By the Clone Wars, the President of the Council, Beolars Bribbs, was also CEO of SoroSuub. Eventually, SoroSuub dissolved the Council when it declared its allegiance to the Galactic Empire. However, the Council was restored after some \"changes\" in the membership of SoroSuub's Board of Directors. As of the Yuuzhan Vong War, the Sullustan Council had control of internal affairs, legislation, and foreign affairs, though SoroSuub shares several civic duties with the Council, and remained the default representative of Sullustans in the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
