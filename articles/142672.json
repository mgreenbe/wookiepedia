It was published on the Wizards of the Coast website on December 20 2001. It consisted of two parts: an in-universe press release from Thurm Loogg of the Metatheran Cartel, followed by an out-of-universe explanation of Loogg's speech. The in-universe speech addressed the concerns of the Cularin public over the Cartel's gift of the XP-38, a starship outfitted for defense, to the planet, and the subsequent discovery of a transmitter aboard the ship. This referred to events that occurred during An Uneasy Peace, the Living Force interactive held at Winter Fantasy 2001."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
