Originally a member of the Fian Security Force, he entered politics at the age of forty, when he became a devotee of the God of Age known as Gotagei. During the Yevethan Purge, Knox went to Coruscant to appeal directly to Chief of State Leia Organa Solo for protection from the Yevetha, waiting outside the Solo residence at the Imperial Palace for at least a day. Acting outside the powers of the Chief of State, Leia admitted Galantos into the New Republic. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, however, he made a deal with the Peace Brigade, agreeing to sever contact with the New Republic in return for the Yuuzhan Vong removing the threat of the Yevetha. When Leia Organa Solo arrived on Galantos, Jobath tried to wait them out, but after the Yuuzhan Vong attacked Galantos while Leia was on planet, he quickly brought Galantos into the Galactic Alliance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
