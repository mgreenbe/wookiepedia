The TL3 was a small processing device that was tied into the droid's existing photoreceptors. It was capable of recording everything from the droid's perspective, and the information could be downloaded onto datacards, data plaques, and holoprojectors. The basic model of the package was only capable of recording in Human-range, but upgrades were available that allowed the droid to record in the macrobinocular range and in three-hundred and sixty degrees."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
