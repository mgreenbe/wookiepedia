The tyrant rancors were known to grow almost twenty meters in height, and could weigh up to thirty tons. The rancors' main prey was the detyun, a large herbivorous bipedal reptile that roamed the wastelands of Dathomir. The tyrant rancor also preyed upon qwerton bathers, lirsk birds and even the sand rancors that lived in the same area."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tyrant rancor also ate humans and was feared by the inhabitants of Dathomir. Like common rancors and sand rancors, tyrant rancors were often used as a tool in the disposal of enemies. This was a fashion throughout the galaxy and was performed by many crime lords, including Jabba the Hutt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
