Based out of the city of Iziz, Nadd's reign was marked by his iron fist and his institution of martial law to help bring the world under his control. During this time, Nadd made the decision that all criminals were to be banished outside the walls of the city where they would be hunted and killed by the predators that roamed free there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, contrary to Nadd's planning, some of them managed to survive and learned to domesticate the predators, eventually building a large force which they then used to attack Nadd and his followers, thus starting an enormous war which engulfed the whole of Onderon. The Beast Wars soon grew out of the control of Freedon Nadd, who was ultimately unable to stop them, thus allowing them to continue well after his death\u2014the war would not end until 4000 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the events surrounding his death, Freedon Nadd's remains were buried on Onderon beneath the royal palace in Iziz, eventually becoming a focal point of dark side energy to be used and exploited by his descendant's.

When they had what they came for they retreated to the sub levels of the city."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Master Jeth, Ulic Qel-Droma and Queen Galia then searched the sub levels for King Ommin, who was rumored to live there, in search for a way to remove the darkness from the planet. When they found Ommin, Freedon Nadd's spirit appeared and the King revealed that he was the leader of the Naddists. While Qel-Droma fought Warb Null, King Ommin was able to capture Master Jeth and escape.

After receiving Qel-Droma's message, the Galactic Senate's Defense Committee engaged in a heated debate about sending the Republic fleet to Onderon or not. Some of the senators felt that fighting the dark side was a matter for the Jedi, not the Republic. The Tchuukthai Jedi Master Thon managed to convince the senators to come to the Jedi's aid and Republic battlecruisers and troop transports converged on Onderon, together with a team of handpicked Jedi Knights from Ossus."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Republic rocket-jumpers attacked the Naddists in Iziz while the Jedi Knights Dace Diath, Qrrrl Toq, Shoaneb Culu, Kith Kark, and Nomi Sunrider, who used her Battle meditation against the Naddists, assisted in the defense of Fortress Kira and drove back the Naddists. Kith Kark was killed during the battle, and Nomi was knocked from her feet by the Dark Side, but was unharmed. The Jedi then returned to Iziz to rescue Master Jeth, when they entered Ommin's lair they destroyed several Sith war droids. Cay Qel-Droma lost his droid arm while his brother and Sunrider attacked Ommin, who proved to be a formidable opponent. But the Jedi eventually triumphed when Qel-Droma destroyed Ommin's mechanical exoskeleton and the King fell to the ground like an Arkanian jellyfish.
