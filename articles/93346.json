Qui-Gon took him back to their camp in the Arorua jungles, where Mosko arrogantly demanded food from them. Qui-Gon gave it to him, much to the chagrin of the annoyed Obi-Wan. Mosko left after that, but came back later and attacked the Jedi camp with several of his Moggonite friends; they were all quickly vanquished by Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
