The weapon buzzed, thrummed, and glowed ember-hot when ignited and, when tasked to cut, could be used as a crude surgical implement capable of cutting into an animal's innards. They were also capable of punching through the plastoid armor of a stormtrooper. Such weapons were often kept in sheaths or scabbards."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The bounty hunter Jango Fett had vibroblades hidden in his gauntlets.
