He was a nondescript-looking man who could easily blend into any crowd, traits that served him well on many missions that required stealth. Page was born to a wealthy Imperial senator and spent his youth training himself in various combat techniques before being sent to the Imperial Academy. After graduating with honors, Page briefly served in the Imperial Army, but had no love for the Empire and quickly defected to the Rebellion after hearing a passionate speech given by the Rebel leader Leia Organa to the Council of Galactic Rights. In his first years as a Rebel, Page served on the ground at the Battles of Hoth and Endor. Following the latter battle, he was given command of the Katarn Commandos, and he trained them to be an irregular and independent unit that was given a great deal of freedom in completing its mission objectives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Page led his commandos on many successful sabotage and retrieval missions throughout the early years of the New Republic, and in 8 ABY, struck at Kal'Shebbol, the fortress world of the Imperial warlord Moff Kentor Sarne.

Sarne escaped with a potent new form of weapons technology, and Page organized an operation to pursue the rogue Imperial throughout the Kathol sector before he could become a serious threat to the galaxy. Although Page did not join the strike force, Sarne was defeated and his threat neutralized.

He served aboard the Memory of Ithor, but the cruiser was destroyed by the enemy and its crew taken prisoner on Selvaris. Page and Commander Pash Cracken received vital intelligence while incarcerated at the prison compound and arranged for four inmates to escape and bring it to Galactic Alliance High Command. The information helped the Alliance rescue Page, Cracken, and a score of other prisoners, and Page was soon sent on a mission to Caluula to destroy a Yuuzhan Vong war coordinator. Shortly afterward, he led the Katarn Commandos onto enemy-held Coruscant, the former New Republic capital world, and joined a team of Jedi in storming the Citadel of the Yuuzhan Vong's Supreme Overlord Shimrra.

When he was four years old, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine of the Galactic Republic reorganized the galaxy's ruling body into a Galactic Empire and ordered the execution of the many members of the Jedi Order, a group of Force-using peacekeepers who had been protecting the Republic for over a thousand generations. Page's father became a wealthy senator in Palpatine's New Order, giving his son a pampered childhood. Page grew up hearing tales of the Jedi Knights and began idolizing the legendary group, despising his father for not possessing any of the traits that the Jedi had embodied. Although he was not Force-sensitive, Page committed himself to following in his heroes' footsteps and took advantage of his father's wealth to train himself in various combat techniques. While the children of other senators in the Empire's Core Worlds grew fat and lazy, Page honed his skills, unsure of what advantages they would bring him but content that he was staying active. His efforts were supported by his father, who supposed that Page's youthful idealism would eventually fade away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Years later, Page's father sent his son to the Imperial Academy in order to put his combat training to use. Although Page had no desire to serve the Empire, he quickly discovered the vast avenues of study afforded to the son of a prominent Imperial senator and set himself to learning the theories of planetfall combat from the Empire's best teachers. He despised his instructors, but accepted their teachings and was groomed to be an officer. He graduated from the Academy with honors and was assigned to the Imperial Army, serving under General Veers in a ground assault unit. Around the same time, he was on leave and at the galactic capital of Coruscant when he heard a speech given by Senator Leia Organa of Alderaan. He found the younger woman beautiful and passionate, and he listened to a speech she gave to the Council of Galactic Rights. It was unlike any speech he had heard Imperial senators give before, most of which he had found sweet-coated and rambling. Organa spoke out against the Empire's positions on slavery and humanocentrism, and made several implicit references to the Alliance to Restore the Republic, a rebel movement that had recently begun stirring across the galaxy. Page, understanding the speech's hidden meaning, realized that the Alliance was the dream he had been following his entire life."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Page deserted his post at the first opportunity and joined the Rebel Alliance. Relatively new and still somewhat rag-tag, the Alliance had no special forces or commando brigades until General Crix Madine, himself another defector from the Empire, convinced his fellow members of Alliance High Command that elite commando units would improve the Alliance's chances in their war against the Empire. Madine had led one such commando unit during his Imperial service, and he went about organizing several similar units within the Alliance. Page joined a unit of the new Alliance Special Forces, led by Major Bren Derlin, that was charged with protecting the Alliance's Echo Base on the ice planet of Hoth. In 3 ABY, Derlin was appointed the base's chief of security and operations by General Carlist Rieekan, who commanded all Rebel forces in the Hoth system. Rieekan hoped to keep the base's existence a secret from the Empire, but when an Imperial probe droid arrived onworld and caught wind of the Alliance's operations, the base was attacked by Page's former commanding officer, General Veers, who led a ground assault composed of several AT-AT and AT-ST walkers. Commander Luke Skywalker led the Alliance's Rogue Squadron in snowspeeders against the walkers while Derlin commanded a battalion of soldiers.

He was with the fleet when it massed off of Sullust; the fleet's ranks were still doubtful and demoralized after the Alliance's defeat at Hoth. The fleet received a much-needed morale boost when Captain Han Solo, who had been frozen in carbonite and in the clutches of the crime lord Jabba the Hutt for a year, arrived in-system after being rescued by some of his closest friends. The Supreme Commander of the Alliance, Mon Mothma, soon called a meeting of all Rebel commanders aboard the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser Home One, and Page attended as she announced that the fleet would be striking at the Empire's unfinished battle station orbiting the moon of Endor\u2014the second Death Star. Solo, promoted to General, assembled a strike team to land on the forest moon, and recruited men who had served at Echo Base. He had witnessed their loyalty and dedication, and was aware of their resourcefulness and ability to devise creative situations. He appointed Derlin as his planet-level unit leader. Eager to serve, Page joined Derlin's commando unit. Their mission was to destroy a deflector shield generator, which would allow the fleet to mount an attack on the Death Star."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On Derlin's recommendation, Page also recruited into the strike team a group of Rebel operatives that had been pivotal in delivering intelligence on the Death Star's location to Alliance High Command."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The strike team traveled to the Endor system aboard the stolen Imperial Lambda-class T-4a shuttle Tydirium piloted by Solo, and bypassed the Imperial fleet when Solo transmitted a stolen Imperial code and claimed to be delivering supplies to the forest moon. After landing on Endor's surface, they began scouting the area, but Solo, Luke Skywalker, Solo's co-pilot Chewbacca, and the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 separated from the rest of the commandos in order to track down Leia Organa, who had chased after Imperial scout troopers in order to keep the team's presence a secret. The plan was to rendezvous at the shield generator bunker at 0300 hours, and as Page and the rest of the strike team made their way through the moon's forests, they stealthily avoided several Imperial patrols before making camp for the night in a shallow ravine. Upon the approach of a patrolling AT-ST, the strike team fanned out and took cover, but Major Derlin feared that their discovery was inevitable. Strike team members Corporal Dansra Beezer and Lieutenant Greeve jammed the walker's transmissions and destroyed its spotlights with a sniper rifle, respectively, and the entire strike team began circling it in an attempt to keep it off-balance. The pilots began firing randomly, however, until the rookiee Corporal Delevar tossed a smoke canister into the walker's cockpit."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The pilots evacuated their vehicle and surrendered, and the strike team coerced them into making several apparently normal comm reports to their superiors. The next morning, the team rendezvoused with Solo, who had formed an alliance with the moon's native Ewoks. The Ewok tribe of Bright Tree Village helped show the commandos a route to the shield generator's back door. A large group of Imperial stormtroopers, scout troopers, and AT-ST walkers ambushed them, but the Ewoks began attacking the Imperials in force. Page led his own detachment of commandos and deployed them in the ensuing confusion; the Ewoks helped turn the tide of the battle in the Rebels' favor and the commandos were able to set explosive charges and destroy the generator. With the Death Star's deflector shield down, the Rebel fleet was able to enter the station and fire at its power core, setting off a chain reaction that destroyed the battle station. Both Galactic Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader, the Supreme Commander of the Imperial fleet, were killed, dealing the Empire a crippling blow."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the loss of the Death Star, the space battle continued to rage for several hours. Derlin placed Page in temporary command of the entire commando force while he supervised incoming ground forces. When Page learned of the trouble in orbit, Solo and Chewbacca grew eager to take the Tydirium to the fleet and lend assistance. Unable to contact Alliance High Command due to disrupted communications, the three took Page's complement of commandos and piloted the shuttle into the battle, where Solo hatched a plan to commandeer the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Accuser. He transmitted the same Imperial code that had granted them planetfall on Endor and told the Accuser's captain that they had escaped from the Death Star prior to its destruction; the Accuser's crew subsequently used tractor beams to bring the Tydirium onboard. The commando team then donned stormtrooper armor taken from defeated Imperial infantry on Endor, while Solo dressed as an Imperial general. They stormed the warship's bridge and secured all members of its crew while Solo knocked the captain unconscious; they then activated the ship's hull-breach alarm and caused the rest of the crew to abandon ship. The Alliance was now in control of an Imperial Star Destroyer, and the remaining ships of the Imperial fleet eventually fled the system.

Under Derlin's command, the unit had been in charge of protecting Alliance High Command, but Page turned it into a rogue group of twelve soldiers that took on any assignment that would promote the cause of the New Republic, the Rebellion's successor state. They often disappeared into the field and operated undercover for weeks or months at a time without reporting to any New Republic contacts.

They then stormed the heavily-armed flying fortress of the Imperial governor Nistola and forced his surrender. When New Republic General Garret landed onworld with an invasion force, he was able to take the capital without firing a shot.

Former Grand Vizier Sate Pestage had been ruling in Palpatine's wake for a year, but fled Coruscant to Ciutric IV when Director of Imperial Intelligence Ysanne Isard sought to remove him from power. He had earlier met and bargained with Organa Solo, and the New Republic sent starfighter squadrons and Kapp Dendo's Commando Team One to Ciutric IV to rescue the defecting Pestage. Page joined Dendo's commandos as they infiltrated a city on the world's surface and extracted their target, but the Imperial Interdictor Star Destroyer Binder prevented them from fleeing the planet into hyperspace. The starfighter unit Rogue Squadron joined Pestage and the commandos onworld as they camped in Ciutric IV's forests for the night. New Republic reinforcements arrived the next day and disabled the Binder's gravity well projectors, and Page helped Dendo bring injured commandos onto evacuation shuttles during a firefight with stormtroopers.

Page arrived with several of his team members and rendezvoused with Calrissian, who had already hatched a plan. A group of spice dealers were due to shortly arrive, and two thieves had taken over a nearby junkyard that housed an AT-AT with the intention of using the war machine to interrupt the spice deal and claim the contraband for themselves. As two of Page's commandos lay in wait to hijack the AT-AT, Page and Calrissian watched from behind a warehouse as the walker marched out of the junkyard and towards the deal. The thieves fired the AT-AT's weapons at the spice dealers, and when they descended to the ground to nab the spice, Page's team emerged from the shadows and stunned them before ascending the side of the vehicle and dispatching their comrades. The commandos' work was done, and after Calrissian told Page that the AT-AT was one of forty he needed for an upcoming mining project on Nkllon, the lieutenant headed over to help his men secure the AT-AT."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Midway through 6 ABY, Rogue Squadron began leading a New Republic push toward the core that was intended to conclude with the capture of Coruscant. The Colonies world of Borleias was targeted as a good staging world from which to strike at the galactic capital, and General Laryn Kre'fey devised a plan to capture the Imperial base there. He hoped to bombard the base from space before landing commandos in assault shuttles. At the New Republic's base on Noquivzor, Page approached Kre'fey and suggested delaying the assault by three weeks in order to use a meteor shower as cover for his commandos to land on Borleias and disable the base's ion cannons; but Kre'fey, eager to strike as soon as possible, refused. The assault went ahead, although very few were notified which planet they were actually attacking; the target was codenamed \"Blackmoon.\" Page and his commandos were stationed aboard the assault shuttle Devonian during the invasion. After the New Republic forces penetrated the Imperial base's shield, General Evir Derricote, the Imperial officer in charge of the base, launched several secret TIE interceptor squadrons at the fleet and suddenly brought the shields back up. The New Republic forces suffered heavy losses, and the Devonian was saved from a group of attacking interceptors by the Rogues Corran Horn and Ooryl Qrygg. The fleet then fled into hyperspace and back to Noquivzor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Page tracked down Horn at the Noquivzor base recreation center, introduced himself, and bought the pilot a mug of lum. The two discussed the failed mission, and Page offered his opinion that Kre'fey had hurried his battle plans in the hope of being given command of the forthcoming invasion of Coruscant. Rogue Squadron's quartermaster M-3PO commed Horn at that moment to inform him that Horn's astromech droid Whistler had calculated wind currents on Blackmoon; Page and Horn, eager to learn more about the world they had failed to capture, investigated the information and discovered that Blackmoon was Borleias. Further research into Borleias revealed that an Alderaan Biotics facility was housed there, and the two deduced that the facility's generator had allowed Derricote to reinforce his shields. They brought the information to Rogue Leader Commander Wedge Antilles and General Horton Salm, and the four of them worked together to plan a second strike at Borleias. Several weeks later, the New Republic fleet returned, and the Rogues destroyed a power conduit that supplied energy to the Imperial base. This allowed Page and his commandos to land onworld, slip in through the exposed tunnel left by the destroyed conduit, and gain control of the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With Borleias under their control, the New Republic's plans for taking Coruscant went ahead in full force. In 7 ABY, the Provisional Council authorized Rogue Squadron to land on the prison world of Kessel and free several criminals, who would then be dispatched to the Coruscant Underworld to stir chaos. The Rogues performed a flyby of an abandoned Imperial base on Kessel's Garrison Moon to neutralize any remaining defenses, which allowed Page and his commandos to land on the moon and secure the base. Afterward, the Rogues cleared a landing zone on Kessel itself, which the commandos also secured by setting up a perimeter around a hillock at the center of the landing zone. After several Rogues landed, Page noticed an incoming landspeeder, and spoke with the driver as his commandos inspected the vehicle. He then authorized the passengers, Kassar and Myda Forge, to speak with Antilles about transferring the prisoners that they were employed to educate. Several prisoners were brought to Coruscant, and Rogue Squadron was covertly inserted into the planet's underworld, where they were able to bring down the fortress world's planetary shields, allowing the New Republic to take the planet."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Striking at Sarne"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One year after taking Coruscant, the New Republic received intelligence that Moff Kentor Sarne, an Imperial warlord who ruled the isolated Kathol sector, had gained access to a potent new form of weapons technology. Hoping to neutralize the threat before it emerged, the New Republic organized a quick strike against Sarne's capital world, Kal'Shebbol. An energy shield protected the planet from orbital attack, and scores of anti-assault weaponry provided a ground-level defense. Rather than take the time to gradually wear down the shield, the New Republic sent the Katarn Commandos onto the planet in order to manually lower it. The Pathfinder Lilla Dade was inserted three days prior to the assault; on the day of the attack, Page and five of his commandos entered the system in a Ghtroc Industries Class 720 freighter, masquerading as a merchant vessel. The New Republic task force followed them in, allowing Page's freighter to make its way to the Imperial Government Complex amidst the ensuing confusion. They were fired on by an Atgar defense tower, but their vessel crashed through the complex's perimeter fence, allowing them access to the compound. Syla Tors, who had been piloting the vessel, rigged it to explode when Imperials came to investigate, and the team was met by Kl'aal, a local Defel who had been recruited by Dade. Kl'aal brought them to Dade, who showed the team an entrance to an armored tunnel she had discovered during her pathfinding. Page ordered his team into the tunnel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Five Imperial officers sat in a control room at the end of the tunnel, but they were quickly neutralized by Page and his team. The commando Keleman Ciro accessed a control panel and discovered that the energy shield control room was halfway across the complex, but also located a hangar that housed a Carrack-class light cruiser that Sarne kept as an emergency escape vehicle. Page figured that either the hangar or the cruiser contained a cutoff for the shield, and brought Ciro, Tors, and Vandro, another commando, through the tunnel to the hangar. He sent Dade, Kl'aal, and his commandos Kaiya Adrimetrum and Gottu to the complex's detention center to free any captives. En route to the hangar, Page's team encountered Sarne and a stormtrooper guard and opened fire. Two stormtroopers fell, but Sarne opened his Mindwarper module, an advanced piece of weaponry that emitted a mist and knocked Page's team unconscious. Sarne and his surviving guard fled, and Page's team awoke after two minutes, slightly disorientated. After regaining their bearings, they continued their pursuit of Sarne, eventually reaching the hangar and engaging more stormtroopers in a firefight. Vandro launched a grenade from a Viper grenade launcher, killing the troopers, but Sarne had already escaped in his cruiser, the Ambition. Ciro accessed a control panel, and, using a handheld beamdrill, locked the planetary shields in an open position after Sarne deactivated them for his escape. The New Republic task force was thus able to take the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the planet had fallen, Page worried that Sarne had escaped with a large portion of his forces and the advanced technology that he had witnessed firsthand. He converted a small office in an apartment complex into a command room, and from there contacted the task force's admiral to request additional forces to pursue the Moff. The New Republic was thinly spread, however, and Page resigned himself to recruiting from Kal'Shebbol's civilian population. Jessa Dajus, an Imperial officer who had been incarcerated in Sarne's detention center, entered his office and told him of a project she had overheard Sarne utter: DarkStryder. Sarne had flash-cleared all information from the base's computers, and Page was thus glad for the lead the codeword provided, however slim it may have been. Dajus claimed to be a victim of Sarne's \"loyalty purges\" and on the side of the New Republic, and told Page of a secret dock in the planet's Sorbiss Valley where a CR90 corvette named Renegade was undergoing an extensive refit. She and Page set off to find it, but were accosted by a Twi'lek named Loh'khar on the city streets along the way.

He recruited heavily from the civilian population as well, including Dajus and Loh'khar. Page prepared a mission briefing for Ciro, giving him several objectives: In addition to finding Sarne, Page wanted him to determine where the Moff's technology came from; perform reconnaissance and report on Imperial Forces in the Kathol sector and unknown space beyond the Kathol Rift; perform reconnaissance and report on the Kathol sector and worlds in unknown space; and to represent New Republic interests to any settlements or civilizations he encountered. Page was unable to join him on the mission, but had faith in his command ability. The crew of the Renegade, renamed the FarStar, was able to find and defeat Sarne, discovering that powerful artifacts in the Kathol system were the source of his technology. To Page's dismay, Ciro lost his life in the process. Page lobbied the Provisional Council to hold an honors ceremony for the ship's crew, but Mon Mothma denied the request, believing that knowledge of the powerful artifacts Sarne had found should be kept a secret.

Imperial troops found the pilots in the jungle shortly before nightfall, but made camp for the night rather than take them back to base in darkness. Page watched the Imperials and their HAVr A9 Floating Fortress through a pair of macrobinoculars and decided to feign surrender in order to better commandeer the vehicle. He and his commandos Frorral and Idow approached the transport and announced their surrender to the two troopers standing guard outside of the vehicle, who in turn opened its hatch to fetch their backup. Frorral, a Wookiee, attacked the two troopers as Page lobbed a grenade at the stormtroopers emerging from the transport. Idow retrieved the blaster rifle of one of the downed troops and began firing, and Vandro rushed into the clearing with a repeating blaster and disabled the repulsorlift engines of the transport.

The task force faced a fleet more than thrice its strength and was trapped by Yuuzhan Vong interdictors, but was given a fighting chance when a large portion of the Yuuzhan Vong fleet left, believing the task force's arrival to be a feint. The Galactic Alliance fleet battled the remnants, and destroyed several ships before the Yuuzhan Vong who had departed returned. The Memory of Ithor was heavily damaged in the clash, but most of its crew, including Page and Cracken, reached escape pods before it was destroyed. Antilles was able to take his remaining ships into hyperspace and flee the battle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The surviving crew of the Memory of Ithor were brought to a prisoner-of-war compound in the dense jungles of Yuuzhan Vong-held Selvaris. Roughly 100 prisoners were incarcerated under the watch of the Yuuzhan Vong Commander Malik Carr and Subaltern S'yito, having been captured at Bilbringi and Gyndine. Although all notions of rank were abandoned among the inmates, Page and Cracken became leaders, well-respected and able to give orders. After two months, both had learned to speak the Yuuzhan Vong, and Page sported a thick beard on his face. The two helped dig a tunnel out of the compound that had been under construction by prisoners at the camp for months. Although they completed the digging and fashioned an escape route, Yuuzhan Vong defenses stationed around the compound's perimeter prevented them from organizing a mass escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Resistance movements began sprouting across the planet with the intent of opposing the Yuuzhan Vong, and a Ryn member of one of the groups infiltrated the compound two months after Page's arrival. While serving gruel during a meal, he identified himself to Page and Cracken as Ryn one-one-five of the information-gathering Ryn Network and slipped a holowafer into Cracken's food. The former commander summoned a man who had been christened Coruscant into the grashal that served as their mess hall, who brought with him a sabacc deck. A mock-game was staged, complete with a rowdy circle of kibitzers who protected the viewing of the holowafer's contents from any guards that might enter the grashal. Page and Cracken watched as the message\u2014several seconds of mathematical equations\u2014played, before the wafer self-destructed. Thorsh, a Jenet, and three Bith committed the contents to memory just before several Yuuzhan Vong guards entered with their coufee daggers drawn, and told the prisoners to quiet down.

When Malik Carr was alerted by sentinel beetles of the escapees, he ordered sensislugs, creatures whose exhalations could render most humanoids unconscious, to be placed in each prisoner dormitory. Page, Cracken, and fifty other prisoners awoke in a yard with their hands tied to wooden stakes behind them. Carr brought the captured Bith before them and fitted a tkun around his neck, which would coil itself tighter when disturbed. Page and Cracken insisted that he punish the two of them, but Carr continually prodded the tkun until the choking Bith recited the mathematical codes. He then died before Carr could glean what the code meant, and the commander punished the rest of the prisoners by having them dropped into an immolation pit and left to bake in the sun for more than twenty-four hours. Page insisted on being the first in, and rejected an offer of leniency from Carr, choosing to risk death rather than betray his comrades and give more information on the codes.

Galactic Alliance High Command learned of the convoy and its route from the decrypted mathematical formula that Thorsh had brought them, and sent a strike force to ambush the ships after they made their final pickup at Selvaris. The Alliance fleet's surprise attack decimated the convoy, and the carrier that held Page was boarded by Galactic Alliance strike troops, Han and Leia Organa Solo, and C-3PO. They reached the hold that contained the prisoners and freed them by using arsensalts to dissolve the jelly. Page approached a captive Malik Carr and taunted the commander, pointing out that he would arrive on Coruscant without any prisoners.

They arrived outside of Caluula Station several hours later, but were followed through hyperspace by the slayer ships and discovered a Yuuzhan Vong battle group in the system to boot. The station had been under siege for several weeks, its peril unknown to Galactic Alliance Command due to the disabled HoloNet, but opened its shields long enough to let the Falcon dock.

Caluula's governor had surrendered the world peacefully under the condition that several select scientists could visit to observe the natural phenomenon known as the Nocturne of the Winged-Stars, and as such, Page, Solo, Organa Solo, Kyp Durron, and the Bothan Intelligence officer Wraw posed as the support team of the Ho'Din scientist Meloque. Unbeknownst to any of them save for Wraw, Caluula's governor had in fact surrendered the world so that the Galactic Alliance could test out Alpha Red, an airborne pathogen designed to target the Yuuzhan Vong and all of their living weapons.

In the morning, Meloque found a large number of winged-stars that were puzzlingly inactive, and Page and Durron discovered signs of Yuuzhan Vong beasts tracking the team. They rode their timbus into a canyon, and stationed themselves on two sides of a gulch in order to catch their attackers in a crossfire. The plan worked, and after the warriors fell, Page shouted at Meloque to kill a fleeing bissop hound. The pacifist Ho'Din hesitated, but Wraw fired the shot that would prevent the beast from returning to its base.

They pressed on regardless, and after several hours reached a low ridge overlooking Caluula City, where the yammosk was housed. While they hatched an infiltration plan, four Yuuzhan Vong Slayers arrived and killed Sasso and Ferfer. The elite warriors then overpowered the rest of the team, resisting blaster shots and lightsaber strikes. While Page and Wraw held two off with their blasters, the amphistaff of another sank its fangs into Solo's neck and injected him with venom.

The Slayers departed Caluula while the captives were stuck to the floor of the yammosk's chamber with blorash jelly. Not even the jelly was immune to Alpha Red's effects, however, and soon liquefied enough to allow its prisoners to roam free. Solo awoke, the potency of the venom having also been reduced, and a dying Carr was dragged into the chamber by two equally exhausted warriors and a priest.

Durron realized what had happened, having been one of few privy to the knowledge of Alpha Red, and Wraw nonchalantly explained the true nature of the mission to those gathered. He hoped for the Slayers who had departed the planet to bring the pathogen to Coruscant and end the war, but his companions recalled the dead insects and realized that Alpha Red in fact affected more than just Yuuzhan Vong.

Many Yuuzhan Vong feared the planet as a portent of doom, while their heretical Jedi-worshipping Shamed Ones interpreted its arrival as a symbol of their salvation. When the Solos dropped Page off at Mon Calamari, he learned that Galactic Alliance High Command were taking advantage of the planet's appearance and had ordered a siege of the galactic capital. Wedge Antilles commanded an operation to retake Corulag to be used as a staging point for the attack, and secured the world with aid from the planet's revolting citizens, who had been galvanized by the rescue of Page, their unofficial hero.

This allowed troop transports and gunships to land; the Katarn Commandos were escorted to the surface by Rogue Squadron, Wraith Squadron, Vanguard Squadron, and the Taanab Yellow Aces. After making planetfall, Page sent a group of his commandos to make contact with Shamed Ones, and another group to search for survivors from a transport that had been shot down. The Wraiths Garik Loran and Kell Tainer, commandos in their own right, landed as well and joined Page's team as they extracted Vanguard Leader Jagged Fel from his downed Nssis-class Clawcraft and gave the pilot some water. A barrage of Yuuzhan Vong thud and razor bugs soon came their way, prompting the commandos to take refuge behind a screen of YVH-series battle droids. Several X-wings strafed the attacking Yuuzhan Vong warriors, and the ensuing calm saw four Shamed Ones approach the commandos, led by the Wraith Baljos Arnjak and Pash Cracken. Arnjak had been inserted onto the planet two years prior and had since organized the Shamed Ones into an effective resistance unit, and Cracken had been taken to Coruscant from Caluula to be sacrificed to the Yuuzhan Vong's Gods, but had been rescued by Shamed Ones.

Solo dropped a team of six Jedi off: Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker, Jacen and Jaina Solo, Kenth Hamner, and Tahiri Veila. Page quickly briefed them on the Shamed One's revolt and Shimrra's desire to ruin the world, and the team moved out to storm the sacred precinct and, in particular, Shimrra's Citadel. Fel and several others remained behind, however, waiting for a shuttle that would ferry them to Westport where they could board empty starfighters. En route to the Citadel, the Jedi used the Force to propel them across the rooftops and balconies of the ruined esplanade, and the commandos kept up with the use of jetpacks. Starfighters strafed overhead as the team made their way to the Bridge of Unity, which provided access to their target. As they arrived, a mon duul creature rounded the corner of a nearby building and, through special villip communication devices, relayed a message from Shimrra that told his enemies to perish.
