The creature inhabited Ando's coastal swamps, and had a dull brown scaly hide. Possessing a flat head with eyes angled at forty-five degrees, the Andoan marsh lizard could see above the water when submerged. Andoan marsh lizards had four legs; the front two terminated in sharp claws, while the rear two were flippers used from propulsion. Growing to a size of four and half meters long, the creature also had a short flat tail that could be used as a third flipper when swimming and could also be used as a rudder to turn in water."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
