He was assigned to level 120, just above the wild and raucous Port Town. By the time Lando Calrissian had won the rights to the title of Baron Administrator, Blendin gained the rank of captain and had become a corrupt Guard known for his use of intimidation to secure peace. He readily accepted bribes and was on the payroll of several minor criminals. He commanded his men to never go too far or take too much and draw attention to themselves. In 3 ABY, Jerrol Blendin was one of the two Wing Guards who accompanied Lando when he went to visit several prisoners such as Han Solo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The character of Jerrol Blendin first appeared in the first edition of the Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game sourcebook Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back as an example of a standard Bespin guard, and was only given roleplaying stats.
