Unlike most Huttlets, Rotta did not spend the first fifty years of his life inside his parent's brood pouch, as his father Jabba wanted him to directly experience the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, during the Clone Wars, aged just 10 standard years old, Rotta took part in a pleasure cruise on his father's barge, when his escort skiffs were attacked. With a sole survivor left to share the news with Jabba, the Huttlet was kidnapped by Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress at the direction of Sith Lord Count Dooku, and in cooperation with Rotta's great-uncle, Ziro. Taken aboard the Trident, he was flown to the B'omarr Monastery on the planet Teth. The kidnapping prompted Jabba to make a deal with the Galactic Republic to rescue his son, in turn for free passage through his shipping routes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While being held prisoner on Teth, Rotta became sick, possibly due to his being unaccustomed to the planet's atmosphere. Sometime after his imprisonment, Rotta's cell door was opened and the distressed Huttlet started to wail when he saw Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano. Before leaving, Ahsoka commented upon Rotta by saying he was \"so cute\", to which Skywalker replied by saying that Rotta would not be so cute when he grew up. However, while being taken back to the monastery's front exterior, Ahsoka realized that Rotta was sick and informed her master, prompting Skywalker to call for a backpack to put Rotta in. However, Separatist reinforcements arrived and attacked the squad, prompting Rotta and the others to go back inside. While Rex and the clones stayed at the entrance, Rotta, who was still being carried by Ahsoka, Skywalker, and R2-D2, went deeper into the monastery. They eventually stopped in the throne room; by this time, Rotta was asleep and Ahsoka put him down onto the throne."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, Rotta woke up and started to crawl under the throne. When Captain Rex, under the influence of Ventress, called for their position, Skywalker went looking for Rotta and dragged him out from under the throne. Once the group made it to the docking station at the back of the monastery, they were confronted by Ventress and two droidekas, which prompted R2-D2 to close the door. When Skywalker said that they had run out of options, Rotta wailed, pointing out to the others that there was another docking station with a ship on it. After a duel ended between Ventress \u2014 who cut through the door R2D2 had previously locked \u2014 and Tano, Rotta and the others flew to the docking station via can-cells. Once at the docking station, Skywalker had R2 carry Rotta, with Ahsoka destroying several battle droids and another droid. R2 then carried Rotta onboard the ship, though once on board, Skywalker continuously tried to help his troops, endangering Rotta's safety, though Ahsoka convinced him not to."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While heading towards their ship, vulture droids chased them and ended up running into the star destroyer's side-docking doors, prompting Rotta to wail. With the group unable to take Rotta to a med station onboard the frigate, they had to take the ship to Tatooine. However, as Rotta's condition worsened, Tano had to go in back to look for medical supplies, and while she was gone, Anakin reassured Rotta that they would get him to his father alive, showing that he was developing a begrudging fondness for the Huttlet. With the assistance of a hologram of a medical droid, Tano was able to successfully treat Rotta's illness, though the medication caused him to burp."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the trip through Hyperspace, Rotta eventually fell asleep but was eventually woken up during a dogfight between the Jedi and several IG-100 MagnaGuards. The Twilight was eventually shot down in Tatooine's orbit by enemy forces. Once they crashed, Anakin took Rotta and carried him on his back and started to walk across the treacherous Dune Sea. At some point, Rotta seemed to sense the dark side approaching, and hid inside Anakin's pack. To keep Rotta safe, Skywalker had his pack filled with rocks to distract Count Dooku while Tano and R2-D2 took Rotta to his father. When Magna Guards stood in their way, Tano defeated them. Ahsoka and Rotta eventually made their way to his father's palace, but just as Jabba was about to have Skywalker killed, thinking the Jedi had killed his son, Tano arrived with the lost Rotta. Jabba was overjoyed by the safety of his son and Ahsoka handed Rotta over to him after he woke up. However, once Jabba was about to have Rotta's saviors executed, he closed his eyes, but Rotta's great-uncle Ziro Desilijic Tiure called for Jabba. Instead of Ziro appearing, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala appeared and brought proof that Ziro orchestrated the kidnapping. Jabba was then willing to sign the Republic's treaty, but not before settling a score with Ziro first."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A year later, when Notluwiski Papanoida arrived at Jabba's Palace searching for his daughters, Rotta was also present with his father. After the Baron's arrival, Rotta started to play with a bug and beat it to death on Jabba's tail, prompting Jabba to tell Rotta to stop. The Baron appealed to Jabba's sense of fatherhood, asking him to help him find his own missing daughters. Jabba looked to his son, smiled, and relented, allowing Papanoida to present evidence against the bounty hunter, Greedo, and take the Rodian with him afterward."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 20 BBY, Jabba heard of the activities of the Shadow Collective and sent Rotta away from his palace before Darth Maul and his criminal army arrived."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Post-war"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, Zorba Desilijic Tiure, Rotta's grandfather, produced Jabba's Will, which claimed that he did not have any children to run his criminal empire, and therefore Zorba was to inherit it.

Rotta appeared to often be scared at some points, though had good reasons to be too. Even though Rotta was young, he was able to solve problems easily when others could not, as was shown when Ahsoka and Anakin could not solve the problem of being trapped by Ventress, but Rotta could. Rotta also appeared to be very cheerful and easily amused, for example, when Anakin had his \"we're in trouble look\", Rotta and Ahsoka were amused when Tano said that they couldn't miss it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rotta had grayish-green colored skin, with orange-brown eyes.
