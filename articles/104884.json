The successor of the Phase I clone trooper armor, Phase II was adopted by nearly all clone soldiers of the Galactic Republic by the final days of the Clone Wars. Phase II was eventually retired by the Republic's successor, the Galactic Empire, which provided its stormtroopers with their own unique armor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Phase II clone trooper armor was manufactured by Kaminoan armorsmiths. More advanced than the Phase I clone trooper armor, Phase II armor was capable of supporting more specialized equipment. It was, therefore, more expensive to produce, costing 3,000 credits per suit whereas Phase I cost 2,000 credits. Unlike Phase I, Phase II did not feature an internal life support system, necessitating the use of an external respirator in the absence of breathable atmosphere. As such, Phase II helmets were featured an advanced filtration system, and were also designed to be more comfortable to wear than Phase I helmets."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Like its predecessor, Phase II was a set of form-fitting white plastoid plates over a black body glove. In addition to providing its wearer with better vision, the armor plates were lighter and stronger than that of Phase I. While Phase II was capable of withstanding impacts, pressure, heat and acrid vapors, the armor was vulnerable to a direct hit from a laser blast."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, the armorsmiths of Kamino redesigned the Phase I clone trooper armor, creating the new and improved Phase II armor partway through the galactic conflict. Field-tested by Advanced Recon Commandos, it quickly spread through the ranks of the Grand Army of the Republic, and was adopted by nearly all clones near the war's end. As with the earlier Phase I, clones customized the new armor to their liking, using special markings and color patterns to denote unit affiliation. This trend was introduced by the Jedi Generals, who encouraged the clone troopers to embrace their individuality instead of thinking in lockstep."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Galactic Republic was reorganized into the Galactic Empire, the Phase II kit was initially retained by the clones, who became the first stormtroopers. The once individualistic clones were made to fully conform to the new Empire through their behavioral modification biochips, with their once colorful armor being brought back to an all-white state as they enforced the will of the Empire. Although the troops under their command wore blank white armor, Clone Officers CC-10/994 \"Grey\" and \"Styles\" did retain markings on their gear. Captain \"Howzer\"\u2014who displayed more free will than his blank armored subordinate troopers\u2014possessed teal markings on his gear."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In time, the Empire introduced a new armor set. While large stocks of clone armor had been mothballed, it remained an occasional sight in the galaxy during the Imperial Era, as bounty hunters and pirates made use of scavenged armor plates. The Empire also continued to utilize Phase II armor for specialized soldiers, such as the Imperial shock troopers of the Coruscant Guard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
