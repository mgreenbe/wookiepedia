Convincing the more technologically sophisticated Nikto of Kintan to serve the Hutts was more challenging. However, Churabba realized that the Cult of M'dweshuu which ruled Kintan was feared by the Nikto people, and that the Hutts would be seen as saviors if the Cult's hold on the Nikto was broken. It was believed that she admired the Cult for its ability to galvanize the Nikto people, even as she sought to destroy it and bring the Nikto into the Hutt Empire. She ordered that the Cult's main headquarters be bombarded, killing off many of their leaders and leaving the Nikto people without a strong leadership. The Nikto then signed their support over to her and to the Hutts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
