Despite their defeat, the Republic succeeded in recapturing much of the Sluis sector. The Separatist victory at Sullust allowed the planet to remain one of the Confederacy's most prized holdings until the end of the war."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As regards to the Battle of Sullust, The Clone Wars Campaign Guide stated that Sullust seceded to the Confederacy at the beginning of the war and that the battle took place less than a month after the planet's secession. This likely disputes with The New Essential Chronology, which stated that for a year into the war, Sullust remained a loyal member of the Galactic Republic, serving as a fortress world along the CIS border, until eventually it seceded to the Confederacy\u2013leading the Republic to send a task force in an attempt to reclaim the planet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
