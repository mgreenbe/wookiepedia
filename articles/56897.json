The tree was named after cake because, like many cakes, it was layered, with each layer smaller than the other. The species was extremely tall and appeared very thick, covering the surface of Saleucami. Flocks of starklebirds took shelter in these trees."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
