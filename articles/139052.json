The ship had several large halls where visitors could purchase goods from the shrewd Ithorian traders. A popular area to visit was the Great Atrium; it was nearly a kilometer across, with moss-covered walls leading to the open air above. Other popular destinations included the upper and lower observation decks, which offered stunning views of the jungle and Ithor's brilliant violet night sky. Adventurous visitors were allowed to rent speeders for guided sight-seeing tours above the jungle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tafanda Bay was the flagship of the Ithorian ground fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The majestic eco-city was a popular destination for tourists and a center of commerce in the Lesser Plooriod Cluster."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the reign of the Galactic Empire, Emperor Palpatine sent the Star Destroyer Conquest to persuade the Ithorians to give up their ecological secrets.

The Yuuzhan Vong invaded Tafanda Bay during the Battle of Ithor. The Legacy of Torment arrived in the system above Ithor after Corran Horn discovered on Garqi that the Bafforr trees reacted violently with the Yuuzhan Vong armor. As Admiral Gilad Pellaeon, Rogue Squadron, and a force of Chiss aliens led by Jagged Fel engaged Coralskippers in space, the Yorik-trema landed their troops inside Tafanda Bay. Luke Skywalker and his Jedi allies engaged the Yuuzhan Vong and Chazrach aboard the herd ship. Relal Towron had to be evacuated to the Core Worlds after the invasion. Ithor was destroyed in this battle, presumably taking Tafanda Bay with it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
