When threatened, a dragon could also project venom directly from its mouth, causing the organic tissues of the target to dissolve. Once dried and ground into an orange powder, krayt venom could be used as a poison. However, it was more difficult to obtain, and less toxic than other poisonous substances, such as rock wart venom or crystallized chall. Bib Fortuna, Jabba the Hutt's majordomo on Tatooine, was known to carry krayt venom powder."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
