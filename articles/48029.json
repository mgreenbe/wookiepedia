It was a non-profit endeavor, asking members to pay only the cost of the blank CD-ROM. However, when members approached Lucasfilm's licensing department for permission to create the CDs, that permission was denied, and the CD-ROM was never distributed. This attempt by the fans did encourage LucasArts to create some early commercial Star Wars media compilations\u2014such as Star Wars: Behind the Magic\u2014and it was also the initial impetus for Lucasfilm to begin thinking seriously about how to interact with networked online fans, and to develop a strategy to deal with the protection of their intellectual property online."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A letter from Shayotovich was printed in the comic book Dark Empire 1, which is now highly collectible.
