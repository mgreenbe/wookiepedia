Gruff and opinionated, Sskeer concealed a secret that threatened to tear him apart. Sometime after losing his left arm during the Battle of Kur, where he also lost his close friend, Jedi Master Jora Malli, Sskeer took his Padawan, Keeve Trennis, to the planet Shuraden for her Jedi Trials. Although they did not go as planned due to a disturbance from a species of star-locust called the ridadi, Sskeer's Padawan was nonetheless knighted due to her heroic actions to save a small city from being destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Starlight Beacon picked up a scrambled distress signal from the Kazlin system, Sskeer, Trennis, and the  Kotabi bond-twins Terec and Ceret took a T-1 shuttle to investigate. The Jedi encountered a trashed starship with bodies and wreckage floating around it. They boarded the ship to search for survivors."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sskeer commanded his companions to don their rebreathers as they realized the ship was filled gas, which was typical for a ship attacked by the Nihil attack. Sskeer split the force in two, going with and Terec to search the rest of the ship as Trennis and Ceret went towards the flight deck. When the other two encountered a dead Hutt, Sskeer noticed grain on the floor, guessing that it was barley. Just then, they were attacked by a lone Nihil marauder, who injured Terec. An enraged Sskeer chased down their foe and quickly slew him, even continuing to slash at the bisected corpse in his rage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sskeer reported that they had found no survivors, only an abandoned member of the Nihil, saying that they were animals that had no honor. Avar Kriss, who was Marshal of Starlight Beacon, warned Sskeer against demonizing their enemies, to which Sskeer responded that he would attempt to find peace through meditation. However, Kriss assigned him and Ceret the task of going to the Sedri system to find the origin of the shipment of Vratixia renanicus, the grain that he had identified onboard. They took the ship to the system as Trennis and Terec waited for Kriss to arrive with Jedi Knight Vernestra Rwoh. As they arrived on Sedri Minor, Sskeer was told by a local Artiodac Kalo Sulman that Jedi were not welcome in their independent colony."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sskeer is a character created for the Star Wars: The High Republic publishing program who features in the Marvel Comics series of the same name, written by Cavan Scott.
