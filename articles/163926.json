A large ice canyon, it featured small volcanoes along the canyon floor, and the Chilling Death Spire was constructed from the ice mountain that the ravine encircled. The Firefrost Lavaworks and the Firefrost Reactor Facility were both located in caves accessible from the the floor of the pass, and the Volcanic Trench and the Eruption Impasse were two offshoots of the White Maw Pass."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
