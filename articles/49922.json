The resulting wave could be so powerful that it could manifest visually unlike a normal Force push, creating a ring of displaced air resembling the shockwave of a sonic boom. The technique could be used to push targets away from the user, or to pull targets towards the user.  It could be used by practitioners of both the light and dark sides of the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 20 BBY,[source?] during the Clone Wars, Savage Opress betrayed his Sith Master Darth Tyranus aboard the latter's Providence-class Dreadnought. Seeking an escape from the dreadnought, Opress headed to a hangar where his solar sailer was waiting. However, he was intercepted by numerous battle droids, who surrounded the Sith assassin and began firing on him. The droids quickly overwhelmed Opress, striking him with blaster fire multiple times. Calling on the Force, Savage used a pulse of Force energy to knock the gathered battle droids off their feet, allowing him to escape."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime later, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker confronted Count Dooku in Rish Loo's laboratory on Naboo. The Jedi engaged in a duel with the Sith Lord. During the fight, Tyranus had his four IG-100 MagnaGuards attack Skywalker. The four droids shocked Skywalker simultaneously using their electrostaffs, forcing the Jedi Knight to the ground. Determined to defeat Dooku, Anakin used a Force pulse to throw the MagnaGuards of him, but was subsequently defeated by the Count of Serenno. Skywalker could also create an inward pulse of Force energy, dragging opponents towards himself rather than away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 14 BBY, Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis used the technique during his secret mission to rebuild the Jedi Order. He displayed the ability to both push and pull targets with his Force pulses. During a mission to Kashyyyk, Kestis dueled the Ninth Sister of the Inquisitorius atop the Origin Tree of Kashyyyk. The Ninth Sister used Force pulses to upturn the surface of the tree, hoping to damage Kestis in the process. Later, during the Mission to Nur, Kestis fought the Second Sister within the Fortress Inquisitorius. Similarly to the Ninth Sister, the Second Sister used Force pulses in an attempt to knock Kestis off his feet. Luke Skywalker was also capable of creating Force repulses."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
