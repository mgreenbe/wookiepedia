Kimble used the stolen money to set up a refugee hospital on the planet Alderaan for his fianc\u00e9, Prudy, though he later ended their engagement. However, the gang eventually tracked down its stolen credits and learned of Prudy's hospital in 3642 BBY. The gang held Prudy hostage and attempted to blackmail Kimble into delivering either the spice or the credits, and Kimble's attempt to go undercover for the Republic Customs Office went sour when he was forced to replace Prudy as the gang's hostage. Fortunately for Kimble, Republic hostage negotiators were eventually able to secure Kimble's release\u2014but not before the gangsters had burned Prudy's hospital to the ground."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This gang first appeared in the 2011 BioWare video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, in which they are mentioned in the conversation \"Best Intentions\" with the Jedi Knight companion Kimble, who was also known as Doc.
