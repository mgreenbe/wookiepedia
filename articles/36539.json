The Alliance sent Granit to Delantine to bolster Rebel sympathy. Trux Zissu was chosen to be the Governor of Delantine by the Alliance after the Battle of Yavin. Trux and his son Stuart Zissu traveled to the Delantine system from Yavin 4 with C-3PO, 4B-X, and R2-D2 in Timespan, but the ship was disabled by an Imperial warship when it reached the system. Trux gave himself up to the Imperials, buying Stuart time to escape to the surface of Da'nor in Escape Pod 4 with the droids.
