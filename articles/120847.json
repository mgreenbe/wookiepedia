The mental torture he endured led to the development of paranoid delusions and egotism. This condition had gone unnoticed by the crew of the FarStar, but Chase gradually became more outspoken and insubordinate. Eventually, the full extent of his paranoia was made known when he organized a mutiny against Captain Kaiya Adrimetrum. He became unstable and would rant and demonstrate impulsive behavior."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The depiction of schizoid personality in The Kathol Rift, printed in May of 1996 by West End Games, differs significantly in diagnostic criteria and symptomology of the real-world disorder. A diagnosis of schizoid personality disorder involves a pervasive pattern of social detachment, and restricted expression of emotions. An individual with this condition would begin to develop it in early adulthood and be seen by others as a \"loner.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Schizoid personality disorder does not include the paranoid delusions or the grandiose pattern of thinking that are present in Lowen Chase.
