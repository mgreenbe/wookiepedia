The pirates however didn't count on Mara Jade, who was stationed onboard. After arriving at the pirates' orbital shipyard via a crate, she stowed away on a ship to Kaerobani's base on Rathalay. There, due largely to the raiders' sloppiness, Jade was able to recover the Holocron and escape."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
