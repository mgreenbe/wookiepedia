This was due in large part to their intelligence and natural ability to climb the trees when hunting. They were also adept at ambushing tactics, leaving their prey nowhere to escape where the beasts would then use their sharp claws and teeth to take down even large animals. Their aggressive nature and intelligence made the clamberwolf virtually impossible to train and difficult to even study."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
