Ecclessis Figg had thermo-converters on Cloud City built from tursturin in order to provide the multitude of energy needed to keep the city operational. In general, thermo-converters were not constructed of tursturin since the energy required to create the heat was greater than the energy produced. However, Bespin's free heat and the size of the thermo-converter's surface area made the use of tursturin cost-effective."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1 ABY industrial saboteurs tried to steal Corellian Technologies' tursturin supplies. As the company did not want to involve local or Imperial law enforcement agencies to avoid questions about the tursturin's provenance, they hired an independent strike team to destroy the saboteurs and their stronghold."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
