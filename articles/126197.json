The exodus allowed for the survival of the Sith species and the birth of a new Sith Empire. However, Vitiate had in fact known the location of Dromund Kaas, a lost colony of the old Empire, the entire time, and the true purpose of the twenty-year exodus was to build his people's devotion to him and make them dependent upon his wisdom and guidance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
