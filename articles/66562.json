The unexpected presence of former Colossus residents turned First Order cadets Tamara Ryvora and Jace Rucklin, as well as Commander Pyre, former commander of the Colossus occupation garrizon, posed a complication, as all three knew who Xiono and Vozo were and would recognize them. In addition, the Titan was hosting an important meeting attended by General Armitage Hux at the time. Xiono and Vozo eventually succeeded in their mission with the covert assistance of Ryvora, who was beginning to question her decision to join the First Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to the First Order/Resistance War, the First Order occupied the Colossus under the pretext of protecting the supertanker fuel depot from pirates. Following the Hosnian Cataclysm, the Colossus resistance led by Resistance spy Kazuda Xiono and former New Republic starfighter pilot Jarek Yeager led a successful uprising against the First Order and brought the station into space. In response, the First Order launched a hunt for the station, seeking to use it to support their war effort."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Colossus escaped First Order forces and operatives on several occasions including the BB-series astromech droid MB-13A, the undercover spy Nenavakasa Nalor, and Pyre's Resurgent-class Star Destroyer in the Ileenium system and near a signal beacon.

They infiltrated the station disguised as First Order technicians. Their mission coincided with a conference of senior First Order officers including Commander Pyre, General Armitage Hux, and First Order Security Bureau Agent Tierny. In addition, the First Order TIE Fighter Pilot cadets Tamara Ryvora and Jace Rucklin were dispatched on an escort and supply run mission to the Titan due to their familiarity with such space stations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kaz narrowly crossed paths with Tam and Rucklin, the former of whom recognized him but did not report his presence. To find a working port, Kaz and his team traveled through the cargo bay. However, Kaz was dragooned by General Hux and his stormtroopers into ushering them to the tower conference room. The First Order forces on the Titan were unfamiliar with the station so the technician Kaz was enlisted for that task. Kaz managed to escort Hux to the conference room and narrowly avoided blowing his cover when Hux made a flippant remark about destroying space stations."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Neeku and CB-23 managed to find a port for CB to plug in. They were questioned by inquisitive stormtroopers but Kaz managed to convince them they were genuine technicians. Kaz and CB learnt that the trans-binary deflector was located in the hyperdrive chamber. While CB-23 stayed behind to man the controls, Kaz and Neeku headed to the hyperdrive chamber, dodging First Order forces on the way. They eventually found the chamber and proceeded to reroute power from the terminal.
