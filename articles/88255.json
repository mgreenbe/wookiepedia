Jinkins was known to have multiple drone fighters attached to his Freefall, about twenty to a magazine. When Jinkins locked on to a target he could launch these drone fighters and they would swarm onto the target and attack it from multiple directions. The speed and agility these drones made them impossible to be hit. Once the target was destroyed or the drone fighters needed to recharge they returned to the Freefall to be used again. But Jinkins could only use them one target at a time and could not launch them until he had locked on to his target."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
