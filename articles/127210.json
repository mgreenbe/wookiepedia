Jedi General Skywalker's task force were under orders to await the arrival of Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi the Negotiator. Skywalker ignored orders, and began his attack on the blockade, although the Separatist fleet was able to hold the line against Skywalker's task force, inflicting heavy casualties on Skywalker's starships and the Pelta-class frigates. As Trench's flagship, the Invincible, rained fire upon the task force, Skywalker decided to order the engines on his vessel, the Resolute, to full power and push past the Invincible and reach the surface.
