Over four millennia would pass before another recorded sighting, followed by a second within a relatively short period, both during the Clone Wars. At this time, the Sliviliths captured the imaginations of holo-serial producers. The creatures were featured in both pre-Imperial Jedi dramas, and the later Voyages of the VSD Protector series of the New Order."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3 ABY, a hibernating Slivilith found its space-borne self caught within the gravitational pull of the planet, Arbra. It awakened from hibernation and thrived on the new mobility that the planet's atmosphere offered it. Seeking relative warmth, it forged a nest for itself inside of an immense cavern filled with geothermal energy crystals. This grotto was one of many habitats occupied by an indigenous rodent-like species known as the Hoojibs. The Hoojibs, incapable of defending themselves against the Slivilith, evacuated the cave and the creature made it its new home."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Not long after the Battle of Hoth, Princess Leia led a survey team to Arbra in the hopes of finding a suitable environment for a new Rebel base. The Rebels met the Hoojib known as Plif who told them of their plight concerning the Slivilith. Leia assembled a team to track the creature down to its cave. The Slivilith attacked Leia's crew and nearly killed an officer named Burtt. Leia and several others, including an officer named Lieutenant Gemmer fought against the creature, but it was Chewbacca the Wookiee that dealt the final blow. Chewbacca grabbed the Slivilith by its anterior tentacles and swung it down into a pile of geothermal crystals. The crystals impaled the Slivilith at various points, ultimately killing it and saving Burtt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
