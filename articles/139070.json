The scene featuring them was cut from the finished version of the film despite Kasdan's objection.

Although the scene was always present since the film's first screenplay draft, director Ron Howard was forced to cut the scene because it was deemed unnecessary."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 2018 canon reference book, Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide by Pablo Hidalgo, confirmed Tag's first and last name."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
