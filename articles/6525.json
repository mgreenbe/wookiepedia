When Tathis was of sixteen or seventeen years, Caryn approached her and told the girl that she had sensed her in the Force. Caryn told Tathis that her presence in the Force was a strong one and that she wished for Tathis to become her apprentice."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tathis eagerly took to Caryn's training, and labored in her master's tropical gardens, making them lush with beauty. Through her physical labors, Tathis learned focus and concentration. Over the course of three years, Tathis learned the skills of controlling her body, Force healing, seeking out knowledge and farseeing. Though Tathis became quite skilled, she was never able to read Caryn's mind. After a time, Caryn felt that she had taught Tathis all she was able, and bid her farewell."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
