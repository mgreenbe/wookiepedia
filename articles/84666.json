During the Confederation Rock Rush in c. 31 BBY, the Nuurglat traveled into the Cularin system asteroid belt carrying a crew of five Caarites that were led by the Cartel executive Niim Stroolg, and they landed it in a cavern inside an asteroid. However, their arrival awoke a shadow creature that lay dormant within the asteroid, and it wrecked the Nuurglat and drove the Caarites to kill themselves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
