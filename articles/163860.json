Armed with missile batteries and the typical blue-beamed Chiss masers, she packed a powerful punch for a ship of her size. The missile launchers could also be used to deploy large shock nets, which could disable target vessels. A precisely-tuned hyperdrive enabled her to make tactical microjumps, and a powerful communications array allowed her to deploy electronic warfare techniques that could confound far more heavily-armed enemies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Mitth'raw'nuruodo seized a Vagaari gravity well projector near the Geroon homeworld, he installed it in the Whirlwind. This allowed the Whirlwind to play a crucial role in the destruction of the Outbound Flight and a large portion of the Vagaari fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
