Sparkers dealt almost no damage to enemy ships' hulls, but rapidly eliminated the target's shields and disabled systems. Inaccurate at long range and possessing a slow rate of fire, Sparkers only had a moderate energy consumption rate."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
