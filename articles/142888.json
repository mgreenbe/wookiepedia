The water interacted with their silicon-based physiology, and acted similar to how alcohol acted on Humans. Kemmel Attapi was the reigning champion until he challenged the Human Dannen Lifehold. The Contest ended with Lifehold winning due to the fact that the Silika water had no effect on his system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
