Shortly after being named a Jedi Master, Ka-Teen was captured by the Black Sun bounty hunter Kallyx the Piner, and was tortured for weeks. During that time, Master Ka-Teen created a complex web of deception and successfully lied, something Ka-Teen thought he would not ever do. Eventually, Ka-Teen was rescued by his Jedi companions, and became reclusive."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his time in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, Master Ka-Teen became interested in the Crown of Verity, an artifact that could detect any lie and conversely force its user to always tell the truth. While the crown was in his possession during the Clone Wars, Ka-Teen felt a vergence on the planet Auratera. Although Ka-Teen was not a Jedi General, several squads of clone troopers accompanied him. At that time, Order 66 was implemented against the Jedi Order, and Ka-Teen was presumed killed, with no reason that he survived. Despite this, the clone troopers that accompanied him never returned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
