Although she tried her hand with smuggling and black market sales, she made her fortune by counterfeiting credits. Gyrr employed her natural Givin talent for mathematics to create false Imperial and New Republic currency, with which she then purchased goods. Although her operation alone did not pose a threat to the stability of the New Republic credit, General Airen Cracken posted a bounty on Gyrr to prevent her from inspiring other criminals to follow her lead. She was believed to have several bases on trade worlds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Born on her species' homeworld of Yag'Dhul in 33 BBY, the female Givin Pendor Gyrr found herself ill at ease among her own people. She instead left the planet and made a name for herself as a currency forger. After the Battle of Endor destabilized the galaxy in 4 ABY, Gyrr capitalized on the economic turmoil to create vast amounts of false currency, including both Imperial and New Republic credits. Gyr played the financial markets by waiting until the value of a particular currency was high, then using her fake credits to make purchases. One of her employees was Qan Gindoch, a Human smuggler, until he was captured on the planet Mantooine by agents of the New Republic, who suspected him of involvement in the counterfeiting operation. Gindoch confessed all he knew and was released in 6 ABY. Gindoch's testimony helped the Republic link confiscated counterfeit money to Gyrr's organization, and thus detect telltale imperfections in her forgeries."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gyrr supplemented her operations by selling stolen items on the black market and smuggling spice.

In 7 ABY, Cracken accordingly put out a bounty of 15,000 for the Givin's capture. Cracken noted unconfirmed reports that suggested the Givin's whereabouts at the time of the posting were on Ord Mantell."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pendor Gyrr used the mathematical talents of her Givin heritage as a boon in creating her false currency, a skill at which she was an expert\u2014despite imperfections that allowed a skilled analyst to detect her handiwork. She was a competent businessbeing, but she was especially knowledgeable of banking procedures, currencies, and financial markets. She was also able to get along in criminal circles. Nevertheless, Gyrr did not fit in with Givin society and instead preferred life off Yag'Dhul."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gyrr was a hairless, black-eyed, 1.6-meter-tall Givin with the bone-white exoskeleton characteristic of her species.
