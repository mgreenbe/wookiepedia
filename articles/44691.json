Some filters were sealed, with an integrated oxygen supply, to allow the wearer to breathe in the absence of an environment. The bounty hunter Mist had a sealed enviro filter as part of her suit of armor, with a three hour supply of oxygen; the helmets of many armor sets had air filters. They were a standard part of starships and space stations, and even some heavily-urbanized worlds such as Coruscant. Servicing of the air filters was part of a standard maintenance package."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
