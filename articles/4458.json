The text was written in an ancient, lost language and was preserved in two volumes, the Aionomicum I and Aionomicum II by Jedi Master and historian Ri-Lee Howell. The two-volume combination of codex, correspondence, and scrapbook collected many of the earliest accounts of explorations and codifications in the Force. The physical books contain passages written in the hands of the original sages, however the books' contents would later be stored in holocrons which were lost prior to 34 ABY. There was rumored to be a third volume of the Aionomica, which was the subject of a forgery scandal 300 years prior to the Great Jedi Purge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 34 ABY,[source?] Rey discovered the tree library and Luke Skywalker explained to her what it was.
