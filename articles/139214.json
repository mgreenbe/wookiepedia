The Tribe were the descendants of Humans from the First Sith Empire who had become stranded on Kesh during the Great Hyperspace War in 5000 BBY. She was the daughter of Grand Lord Varner Hilts and Iliana Hilts. As with most of the Lost Tribe, Takara lived on the continent of Keshtah Minor. Due to her parent's high social status in Keshiri Sith society, Takara enjoyed a privileged childhood as a Sith princess. By 2974 BBY, she had become the Prefect of Police for the Tahv Constabulary, the Sith capital Tahv's main law and enforcement agency. Despite her privileged lifestyle and powerful connections, Takara became frustrated at her father's decision not to appoint his own daughter as his political successor.

One criminal who eluded her was the Human Sith anarchist Parlan Spinner, an outcast who waged a guerrilla war on the Lost Tribe that had persecuted his family for generations. His acts of vandalism and other criminal activities made him a perennial source of instability for the Tribe's leadership. By 2974 BBY, Takara and her father Varner had devised an elaborate scheme to trap and capture Spinner. Through an informant in Spinner's gang, the authorities learned that Spinner was planning to disrupt the festivities commemorating Yaru Korsin's discovery of Kesh and to kill the Grand Lord himself.

Spinner became a sailor aboard the Keshiri sailing ship Southern Star which was captained by the Alanciari mariner Captain Chegg.

The Doomed took the two Humans captive, and their leader, Kaliska, brought them into their settlement where she explained the origins of the Doomed.

Led by Captain Yaru Korsin, these Human settlers became the rulers of Keshiri society by claiming to be the fabled Protectors from an ancient Keshiri legend about the Great Calamity. Over the succeeding millennia, the descendants of these Human Sith came to occupy a privileged status on Kesh. Due to physiological differences however, the Humans and Keshiri were unable to mate. During the Time of the Rot, Kesh experienced significant civil infighting and upheaval as rival elements of the Lost Tribe fought for power following the disappearance of Grand Lord Lillia Venn in 3960 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After nearly a millennia of warfare, Takara's father Varner assumed leadership of the Lost Tribe in 3000 BBY and ended the fighting. Hilts was a historian who had dedicated himself to studying the history of the Lost Tribe and had instituted a series of reforms known as the Hilts Restoration which sought to return to the system first instituted by Korsin. Hilts established a meritocratic power structure that allowed the Sith on Kesh to channel their ambitions without causing violence. To avoid the succession struggles of the past, Hilts made the position of Grand Lost an elected office rather than a hereditary post. Since the Human Sith were a demographic minority on Kesh, Varner stressed that the Tribe had to avoid civil infighting in order to survive. To reduce conflict within the Tribe, her father also sponsored a marine exploration program to explore uncharted lands and seas beyond the main continent Keshtah Minor. This led to the construction of a fleet of wooden sailing ships and the colonization of the continent of Alanciar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a result of her father's policies, the Lost Tribe's marine explorers discovered the continent Alanciar, a new frontier that was rich in lumber and new lands to house Keshtah's surplus population.

The Doomed\u2014the descendants of stranded ancient Jedi and Dark Jedi that had caused the Great Calamity millennia earlier but had since relocated to the frozen continent of Eshkrene in the South Pole\u2014also observed these developments on Keshtah through ice mirrors created by the Force. In 3000 BBY, the Doomed had considered intervening in order to stop The Rot but changed their minds after Hilts managed to restore order to the Tribe. Takara was born at some period after 3000 BBY and presumably had a comfortable and privileged childhood due to her father's high social status. Meanwhile, her mother Iliana served as the commander of the Tribe's military forces which were constantly on the guard against various rebel elements."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Since her father Varner believed that hereditary power led to greater corruption and instability, he took steps to ensure that power within the Tribe was not inherited. To avoid the problems of nepotism, Varner did not favor his daughter Takara by appointing her to powerful positions. Instead, he encouraged her to start from the bottom and her work her way to the top. When she came of age, Takara joined the Tahv Constabulary, an internal security police force based at the Tribe's capital of Tahv. Over the years, the young woman rose through the ranks of the Tahv Constabulary to become the Prefect of Police, the highest ranking police position in her city.

His actions were not guided by a specific set of goals or coherent philosophy but were instead motivated by a desire to harass the authorities through \"minor acts\" of mischief.

Several Keshiri onlookers initially mistook them as being part of the celebration but their presence aroused anger from the Sith participants.

Spinner regarded Hilts as a stereotypical \"absent-minded\" professor who did not fit conventional definitions of a \"proper\" Grand Lord. Her father was examining a Keshiri tapestry which detailed the ancient history of the Keshiri people.

However, Lord Hilts was unconcerned and merely explained to the youth that killing him would be unwise since Spinner lacked the necessary qualities to succeed him as landlord.

Takara then explained to Spinner that this policy reflected her father's idea that power in the tribe was not hereditary but was rather earned through merit.

He instructed his men to set up shelters since there was a snow storm approaching. Meanwhile, Spinner and Takara attempted to sneak back aboard the Southern Star but were caught by the crew.
