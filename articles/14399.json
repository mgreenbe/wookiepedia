The Phantom Project was in fact a con created by his predecessor, Rorax Falken, to racketeer the Empire. Aware of the truth, Captain Wedge Antilles was sent to Mrlsst with Rogue Squadron in order to represent the New Republic and reinforce the illusion. Capain Loka Hask, who was responsible for the deaths of Wedge Antilles's parents, arrived to Mrlsst with the Star Destroyer Dominator as the negotiating representative of the Empire to acquire the technology."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hostilities began when activists of the Ante-Endor Association killed some students of the academy in trying to steal datacards about the project. They left proofs compromising Tycho Celchu that forced Gyr Keela to place Antilles under arrest. Hask's stormtroopers later tried to arrest the other Rogues who managed to escape with the help of Koyi Komad. Antilles was eventually freed by a holographic image of Jedi Knight Taj Junak controlled by Rorax Falken."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hask, angered by this, launched his TIE and bombarded the Academy grounds of Mrlsst. Rogues X-wings intercepted most Imperial fighters but civilian causalities and damaged to the city were huge. Meanwhile, some other Rogues joined Falken's scientific laboratory on an asteroid orbiting the planet. Under questioning from Nep and Terrik, Falken and his students admitted that the Phantom Project was just a hoax, designed to elicit funding from the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Captain Hask and Imperial forces soon arrived to the station to retrieve the plans. While the stormtroopers fought a holographic ghost Jedi controlled by Falken, Dllr Nep, Mirax Terrik and the students retreated to the hangar and boarded Terrik's Pulsar Skate. Falken and Groznik were killed by Loka Hask. The Pulsar Skate attempted to evade the pursuing TIE fighters but was largely defenseless until the arrival of Rogue Squadron. As the Imperial Star Destroyer closed on the Pulsar Skate, Nep and Terrik activated the gravitic polarization beam, a powerful weapon that created a hyperspace wormhole and destroyed both the lab and the Star Destroyer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Wedge Antilles recovered the gravitic polarization beam and decided it was too powerful to be used again.
