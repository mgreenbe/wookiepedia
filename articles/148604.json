The marker would send out signals that allowed the user to find the location again using a tracker. Gamgalon, a Krish who ran Morodin hunting safaris as a cover for an aleudrupe berry harvesting business, used transpond markers in his operations. The safaris were used to mask the planting of the berries, and transpond markers were left at the planting sights to help Gamgalon and his organization find the crops again for harvesting."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
