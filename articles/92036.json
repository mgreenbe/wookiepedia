The primary force field was a hemispherical dome projected on the ground, which could be split into two containment areas, or further subdivided into four. In addition to regulating the main power and force field subdivisions, the mobile stockade's control panel could adjust the overall intensity of the field with a dial scaled from one to eleven; without a key, the field could not be lowered in intensity past level two. Other dials on the panel adjusted the individual intensities of the stockade's force field subdivisions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrackan Sal-Solo and his Human League troops used a mobile stockade to contain Jacen, Jaina, and Anakin Solo, in addition to Chewbacca, Ebrihim, and Marcha, during the First Corellian Insurrection.
