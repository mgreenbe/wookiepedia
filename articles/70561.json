When Ronderu lij Kummar was killed battling the Yam'rii on the beaches of Kalee, her body was lost to the waters of the Jenuwaa Sea. Later in the war, when the Separatists planted a bomb aboard Grievous' shuttle, the destroyed ship plummeted into the sea. Grievous was ejected from the wreckage of the shuttle at Dooku's command, and his shattered body was recovered from the cold waters by the Sith Lord, ready for reconstruction as a cyborg."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
