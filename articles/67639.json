They developed a strong sense of ownership over the temple, attacking anything that entered the vicinity of the ancient structure. However, a being who learned how to wield the Sith magic that emanated from the temple would have been able to manipulate them, such as the mad Devaronian Cartariun. He armed them with Imperial blasters for ground assaults and even motivated them to fly TIE Fighters in aerial combat. Even under Cartariun's control, the Irrukiine retained their volatile nature."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
