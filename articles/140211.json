A starship thief, Golor once worked with a young Niles Ferrier, and the pair learned their trade together. Golor did not particularly care what ships he stole; depending on the demand for a particular ship, he stole both military and civilian vessels. He would subsequently sell the ships on to smugglers or those who supplied pirates or criminal organizations. Golor was wanted by the New Republic for the theft of several New Republic starships, including several T-65 X-wing starfighters and a pair of A/SF-01 B-wing starfighters. Intelligence reports indicated that Golor attempted to contact the Galactic Empire in order to sell his ships and components. The New Republic offered a reward of 18,000 credits for Golor's capture on the charges of theft of New Republic property and theft of civilian property."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tardon Golor was a male Twi'lek who was two meters tall with elaborately tattooed lekku.
