Skilled tailors were able to sew seams in straight lines and judge the quality of fabric and used tools including scissors, sewing machines, clothing mannequins and paper patterns to create their work.

Husband and wife Tomar and Looway Nuq Sin operated the business, and Tomar's mother J'Hara ran the business before them and was famous across the planet for her clothing before she retired a few years before 30 ABY. Tomar Nuq Sin's older brother, Cornell, was also a tailor and the Nuq Sins' son Karr was a novice in the craft. On the opposite side of Merokia there was a trade school in the Taeltor Province that specialized in teaching adults the craft. Cornell was a highly regarded and skilled teacher there and when Karr Nuq Sin's struggles with his health and academics grew too severe, his parents made arrangements with Karr's uncle for him to study the craft at the trade school, hoping he would improve his skills and open his own shop."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet Vjun was home to famous tailors who notably wove the cloak worn by Count Dooku."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The tailor profession was first mentioned in the 2014 canon Star Wars junior novel Servants of the Empire: Edge of the Galaxy by Jason Fry.
