These probes were capable of hyperspace travel and were used for surveillance missions deep into hostile enemy territory. They operated by entering realspace for twenty seconds to take a sensor snapshot of a target and transmitting the data back to a controller."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Black Fleet Crisis, the New Republic Navy and Alpha Blue dispatched more than fifty stasis probes into the N'zoth system to monitor and to draw out the Duskhan League into combat. Probes 203, 239 and 252 were programmed to release Cronau radiation and transmit radar signals to draw out the Yevethan war fleet in preparation for the Battle of N'zoth. Consequently, these probes were destroyed by the Yevetha."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
