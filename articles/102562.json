In 3 ABY, Captain Hazram Namir used one against an Imperial airspeeder during the capture of the Inyusu Tor mineral processing facility on the planet Sullust and Plex-armed anti-air gunners were later positioned to fend off more airspeeders during the Empire's counterattack just two days later."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 5 ABY, Plex missiles were used on the planet Troithe.

The PLX-1 was later identified in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written be Alexander Freed. Freed's 2020 novel Shadow Fall referred to the launcher as the Plex rocket and Plex missile. The PLX-1 resembles the E-60R missile launcher from the 2004 Star Wars Legends game Star Wars: Battlefront.
