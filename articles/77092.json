Showing defiance to their captors, Ko Vakier shared a cell with Greenbark, Mezgraf, and Captain Schurk-Heren to be interrogated for information on the location of their cargo. However, Greenbark managed to escape before Hai's people could begin torturing Mezgraf or Ko Vakier and while Greenbark fought Haka Hai's people, Shurk-Heren, Mezgraf, and Ko Vakier were freed by Uhumele's engineer Ratty.
