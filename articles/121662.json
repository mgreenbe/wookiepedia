During the trek, where he was escorted by the TIE Advanced x1 Alpha Squadron, the Excalibur ended up ambushed by Zaarin's forces, composed of the Assassin-class corvette Ram and at least two Assault Gunboats. Upon ambushing the Excalibur, Zaarin's forces had been notified via radio transmissions, with a large attack group composed of several of his best forces en-route to the Excalibur's position. Because neither Alpha Squadron nor re capable of holding off the attack by themselves, as well as the vital importance of ensuring the Emperor's survival/escape in terms of the Empire's survival, the TIE pilot and Emperor's Hand, Colonel Maarek Stele, leading the TIE Advanced x1 Delta Squadron with his Missile Boat, Tau 1, were dispatched to supply reinforcements to the Excalibur."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Afterwards, the Emperor was returned to Coruscant.
