He was later assigned by Darth Vader to coordinate the surface defense of Endor's moon during the Battle of Endor, again serving under Veers, with whom he had a highly effective working relationship. Igar deployed 74-Z speeder bikes for an effective defense of the Sanctuary Moon. The stormtrooper unit he was commanding had been recommended to him by Imperial Governor Yount from the Wakeelmui garrison. Sergeant Wallen was one of the stormtroopers in this unit. Igar selected the most dedicated stormtroopers of the Empire to serve the Emperor on Endor. He also had a personal honor guard; Corporal Drazin was one of its members. Igar was the commanding officer of Tempest 1. When Luke Skywalker surrendered to the Imperial forces, Commander Igar personally took the prisoner to Lord Vader, and expressed his belief that there were more Rebels hidden in the forests, regardless of Skywalker's claims to the contrary. He then handed Skywalker's new lightsaber to Vader and returned to Tempest 1 to start his search for the Rebels. When the Rebel commando team infiltrated the shield bunker, Igar already had a plan in place to deal with them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Igar was played by William Hoyland.
