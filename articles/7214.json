The planet had been allied with the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars, which is why it had taken eight years for the Empire to formalize the annexation, due to lingering mistrust. On the day of the event, there was a celebration in the capital, Valentia, attended by both first and second-wavers. Despite their differences, both peoples supported the annexation. Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin personally attended, and gave a speech. The day of the annexation was also when first-waver Ciena Ree and second-waver Thane Kyrell met."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
