Waiting until they knew Fett to be unarmored and helpless, they raided the weaponsmiths hideaway in a mountain cavern. Although heavily armed, each one fell to an unarmed Fett.

In a last-second fit of desperation, Risso hijacked Fett's starship, Slave I, and used its missiles to destroy the cave."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Believing Boba Fett had been killed in the explosion, he donned the armor and masqueraded as Fett in a local cantina.
