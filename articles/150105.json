In an effort to secure the allegiance of the Sith, the Rakata plied and seduced the Sith King Adas with gifts of dark-sided knowledge and technology, teaching the Sith King to create his own holocron for the storage of his teachings. Though the Sith had long engaged in sortilege, civil war, and sentient sacrifice, they led spiritually serene lives, never once doubting or questioning the critical role conflict played in their kratocratic society.

During this period of strife and turmoil, a group of Sith of the Kissai priest caste began to publicly interpret the dark side's failure to save Adas from death as a sign from the Force to renounce the dark side and reject the teachings of the Rakata.

Convinced by their interactions with the Forceful Rakata that all sentients were Force-sensitive, the Tundan Sith espoused a monist Unifying Force philosophy that rejected the traditional light side/dark side dualism of conventional philosophy and instead declared the Force to be a single, indivisible cosmic entity without sides or aspects, a conception they called \"the Unity.\""}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Manderon Period"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 6900 BBY, a group of mostly Human-blooded Dark Jedi known as the Exiles arrived on Korriban, having fled from their defeat in the Battle of Corbos at the end of the Hundred-Year Darkness.

The Jedi occasionally sent emissaries and Jedi recruiters to Tund in the hopes of persuading the Sorcerers to eschew their trappings of magic and mysticism, embrace a more conventional understanding of the Force, and join the Jedi Order.

The Force sect as a whole gradually shifted towards the dark side under Tetsu's rule.
