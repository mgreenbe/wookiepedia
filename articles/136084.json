He made a name for himself by working as a pirate in the Outer Rim Territories and was eventually able to build up a gang of at least a dozen other outlaws. He had dealings with several different underworld organizations and was wanted by the Empire, although Imperial inquiries into the mercenary ultimately yielded no results.

He was a Human male, although his past remained a mystery to most. The Empire thought him important enough to issue a warrant for his arrest, though they offered no reward for his capture. His defining trait was a modified stormtrooper helmet that he wore with a large red \"X\" painted across the faceplate. The helmet contained a comlink with a broadband antenna that increased its range to 400 kilometers, as well as a signal interceptor that allowed Stormtrooper X to eavesdrop on encrypted communications. He could speak several different languages, including Basic, Dosh, Huttese, Rodese, and Sullustese."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stormtrooper X was first referenced in the 2001 Star Wars Gamer 6 article Bounties to Die For, written by S.
