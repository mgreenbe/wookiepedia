It was very territorial and used its talons to pick up victims. It could carry up to nine times its own weight. During the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire, bogwings were seen in the valleys of Belsavis. Bogwings were released by Gungans to signal half-time at Gulliball games."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There were two races of bogwings: the greater bogwing and the lesser bogwing.
