During the Clone Wars, Deadeye served as a cold assault trooper in the 44th Special Operations Division's Devil Dogs unit under the command of Major Kendal Ozzel. Around 22 BBY, Deadeye participated in the Battle of Khorm, in which the Galactic Republic battled the Confederacy of Independent Systems for control of the valuable agrocite ore on the frozen planet Khorm. As part of a Republic advance force led by Jedi Generals Plo Koon, Kit Fisto, and Tauht, Deadeye and the Devil Dogs were able to land on the surface of Khorm before a storm in the planet's atmosphere blocked the way for reinforcements."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic ground forces soon captured an agrocite processing facility and received intelligence from Republic Admiral Wieler about a Confederate starship effortlessly passing through an opening in the storm. Realizing that the storm had been manifested by a local weather-control station constructed by the Confederacy, Koon and Fisto took the Devil Dogs, including Deadeye, and set off on CK-6 swoops to destroy the station and make way for the Republic reinforcements. After making a brief stop to bury the dead bodies of several native Khormai in a village devastated by the storm, the Republic strike team proceeded to scale the nearby mountains on foot. There, they were ambushed by the Confederate Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ventress engaged the two Jedi in battle, while her BX-series droid commandos emerged from the snow and attacked the clone troopers.

However, the Jedi had managed to create a Force bubble that protected them and several clone troopers, including Devil Dogs Captain Sharp, from the avalanche.
