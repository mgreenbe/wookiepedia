His job entailed monitoring ships in the system and making sure they followed their planned routes and logging the starship traffic. Getter resided on the Rooted Moon of Hetzal Prime when not aboard the space station and sought to ask out Sella, a Twi'lek bartender at the spaceport's cantina, which he visited three to four nights per week after work to drink ale. When numerous anomalies exited hyperspace, heading for the inhabited bodies of the system, Getter and his colleague, second-class scantech Vel Carann, worked to figure out the anomalies, with Getter having to be the one to analyze them when Carann revealed she did not know how to due to her constant slacking on the job. They sent out a system-wide alert when they realized the objects were going to impact the planet. One of the anomalies struck the monitoring station, atomizing it and killing the Scantechs aboard."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
