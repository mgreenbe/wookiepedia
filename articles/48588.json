During the Force Wars, Jedi High Council member Rajivari searched to retrieve the First Blade. He proved worthy of it, and was permitted to take the hilt.

This Jedi then mounted the hilt into a lightsaber, complete with a crystal that had been found in the Tythonian Forge. Yuon Par, the Herald's Jedi master, also thoroughly studied the engravings on the hilt to deduce the coordinates of the Fount of Rajivari and let her apprentice reach it."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The First Blade was introduced in the 2011 game Star Wars: The Old Republic as part of a class-quest for the Jedi Consular. How it fits in history with the protosaber is currently unknown, but the hilt of the First Blade has no cable or power pack whatsoever. However it is possible that it was modified to work as a modern lightsaber due to the conflict in that era. Combined with the knowledge of Forcesabers used by the Force Hounds of the Infinite Empire, it may have been descended from Xesh's weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
