The atmosphere of Morseer consisted mainly of methane, so all Morseerians had to wear a protective mask and suit to shield their vulnerable bodies from deadly gases such as oxygen, similar to the Skakoans.\nNabrun once worked for Omogg, a Drackmarian warlord of Quelii sector, as did many others of his species. He later left that region of space to escape bounty hunters after he broke the contract. He was particularly familiar with the Triellus Trade Route, between the Sisar Run and Tatooine. In 0 BBY, Leids was present in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina along with the smuggler Rycar Ryjerd when Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi came to look for a pilot, eventually meeting Han Solo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nabrun was portrayed by actress Janice Burchette in A New Hope."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
