Drops of Skyborn blood fell onto the seas of Kesh, creating all of the planet's landmass. In the ages afterward, the Otherside were regarded as the source of all evil on the planet Kesh, and heresy against the Skyborn was said to be glorification of the Otherside. As such, the Keshiri regarded it as the will of the Skyborn that they were to hate the Otherside.

Tradition held that in ages past, the uvak-riding Neshtovar brought the knowledge of the Otherside and the Great Battle to the masses from the Cetajan Mountains. Although faith in the Keshiri religion was prevalent, by 5000 BBY the Neshtovar still had not hammered down exactly who or what the Otherside were. That year, geologist Adari Vaal was brought before the Neshtovar to testify about the veracity of her controversial teachings of the formation of Kesh's landmass, which conflicted with the common Keshiri religion. There, Neshtovar leader Izri Dazh accused her of glorifying the Otherside with her supposed heresy. After harassment by other Keshiri, Vaal fled into the Cetajan Mountains, where she found a group of crash-landed Sith who claimed to be the Skyborn returned to Kesh. After taking control over Kesh, the Sith did away with the use of the terms \"Otherside\" and \"Skyborn\" in favor of earlier tales of the Destructors and Protectors, respectively."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Otherside were first mentioned in John Jackson Miller's 2009 eBook, Lost Tribe of the Sith: Skyborn.
