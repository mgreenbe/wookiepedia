After the Battle of Yavin, he was involved in a CorSec investigation against the Hutt crime lord Borvo. Circa 1 ABY, the CorSec investigation against Borvo the Hutt came to an end when a spacer working for Borvo murdered the infiltrated CorSec agent Niksel Frangee. As nobody in the CorSec knew how Frangee looked like at the moment of his death, the spacer used Frangee's CorSec badge to pass himself off as Frangee on Corellia. Maerzen was going to present the evidence against Borvo to be used in the trial but CorSec Captain Thale Dustrunner gave his location to Borvo's spy. Maerzen was killed in the Riverlands by the spacer who wanted to make sure the evidence never reached the CorSec. The spacer retrieved the evidence, including confiscated money, and brought it back to Borvo the Hutt on Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Maerzen appeared as a non-player character (NPC) in the 2003 MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies.
