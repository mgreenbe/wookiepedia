Despite a decade of law-enforcement activities, LE-VOs were responsible for over 20,000 arrests with no fatalities. This was due partly due to the droids' size and their demeanor, as they were programmed to always choose to stun targets rather than kill. The Galactic Empire allowed the Rseikharhls to continue using these droids due to the non-lethal programming."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several of them served in 12-4C-41's Droid Army in 0 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
