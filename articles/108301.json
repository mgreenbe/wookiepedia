They were most effective against fixed or slow moving targets such as fortifications, space stations, and capital ships. These energy weapons often emitted the signature blue \"glow\" of proton torpedoes. Handheld explosives were termed proton grenades."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The proton bomb was at least twice as powerful as the heavy rocket, though its self-propulsion was very weak and relied upon the inertia of the fighter deploying it. As it took a long time to travel to its destination, many pilots chose to release them close to their target, though this tactic carried the risk of being exposed to enemy fire. The proton torpedo and concussion missile were significantly less powerful compared to the rocket and bomb.[source?]"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Proton bombs were capable of being upgraded to the advanced proton bomb.
