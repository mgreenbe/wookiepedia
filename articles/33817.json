During the Galactic Civil War, the base served three sectors for purposes of coordination and records. At some point between the battles of Yavin and Hoth, the Imperial Navy discovered the location of the base and ordered the Star Destroyers Avenger, Devastator, and Relentless to destroy it. The Alliance learned of the impending assault, and General Carlist Rieekan ordered the evacuation of the base. Only one operative, Agent ZNT-8, was left behind as an observer in the temporary safety of a deep-planet survival shelter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
