In 3644 BBY, Prudy was on the planet Ord Mantell when she encountered the xenopathologist and combat medic Archiban Kimble, better known as Doc. The two began a relationship and soon became engaged, and Doc purchased Prudy a refugee hospital on Alderaan using credits that he had stolen from a gang of criminals after scamming them with a false promise of a spice delivery. However, Prudy rushed their relationship and arranged a wedding before Doc was ready, causing him to break off their engagement just before the ceremony even after her mother and father arrived from Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prudy spent the next two years running her hospital on Alderaan, and Doc did not contact her that entire time until the gang that Doc had scammed tracked down where their funds had gone. Learning that Prudy's hospital had been purchased with their credits, in 3642 BBY the gang took the Twi'lek hostage and burned the hospital to the ground before contacting Doc with a ransom demand: Prudy's life in return for the spice he owed them. Doc was able to secure Prudy's release by taking her place as the gang's hostage, though he managed to escape with the help of the Republic Customs Office and its hostage negotiators. Prudy later contacted Doc via holocomm and expressed her fury to him, and she terminated the transmission in anger after informing him that the gangsters had destroyed her hospital."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A trained doctor who ran a refugee hospital, Prudy was a reddish-pink-skinned Lethan Twi'lek with yellow eyes whose two lekku sported a pattern of dark lines.

She held a grudge against Doc for his departure, and the fact that he did not contact her and that his actions caused the destruction of her hospital did nothing to lessen the anger she felt toward him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prudy first appeared as a hologram in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare and LucasArts in 2011, in which she is featured in the conversation \"Best Intentions\" with the Jedi Knight class companion Doc.
