It had rugged terrain and was covered with grassy plains and vast jungles. This natural beauty attracted offworld travelers keen to experience its wilderness. Prior to the formation of the Galactic Republic, the world was settled by the Rakata as part of their galaxy-spanning Infinite Empire. Following the collapse of their society, scattered temples were all that remained of their time on Generis. The planet was later settled by a mix of Humans and other species, as was another planet in the system, Atrivis 7."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet was within Separatist space during the Clone Wars, but remained neutral. During the Galactic Civil War, it became a hub of resistance against the Galactic Empire. Joint resistance forces in the Atrivis sector set up a centralized base in orbit over the planet before negotiating a treaty with the Alliance to Restore the Republic. As part of this accord, an Outer Rim Communications Center was constructed on the planet, protected by a small starfighter force. Generis became a strategic location for the Alliance, from where it coordinated forces stationed throughout the Atrivis sector. The base was later captured by the forces of Grand Admiral Thrawn during his sustained campaign against the New Republic. Eventually recaptured by the Republic, the base was again attacked, this time during the Yuuzhan Vong War. The assault by the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong invaders intent on conquering the galaxy destroyed much of the planet's surface, but when the Yuuzhan Vong were eventually defeated by the Galactic Alliance, the Generis Communications Center was restored to operating capacity."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Generis was a planet of stunning natural beauty located in the Generis system\u2014sometimes alternatively known as the Atrivis system\u2014a star system located in the Atrivis sector of the Outer Rim Territories.

Much of Generis remained untamed wilderness, with thick jungle foliage soon choking any trails blazed through it. The jungles were full of indigenous creatures and flora, including grasses and dense impenetrable groves of sallap trees. Much of Generis' surface was covered by large oceans, while lakes dotted the landmasses and rivers of white-water rapids crossed the landscape. The planet also had at least one outcrop of hiridiu crystal, located at its southern pole.

Using Force-based hyperdrives, they traveled to many worlds around the galaxy that possessed significant signatures in the Force, uniting them to form the Rakatan Infinite Empire. Among these worlds was Generis, where they constructed large temples. After five thousand years of galactic dominance, plague caused the collapse of the Infinite Empire, and the species later became extinct on Generis. Their temples collapsed into ruins overtaken by the jungle, leaving no clues for later settlers as to how or why they died out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The area of space around Generis was explored following the blazing of the Hydian Way, circa 3000\u20131000 BBY. Generis was lightly settled during the time of the Galactic Republic alongside another planet in the system, Atrivis 7. It was known to the ancient Jedi Master Yoda by 68 BBY, who used a parable based on the planet to educate his students about the dangers of the dark side of the Force. According to Yoda, a Sith Lord tried to blaze a path directly through a grove of sallap trees as a shortcut to a lake on Generis. However, while the path was shorter, it failed to reach its destination. This parable was later retold by Master Qui-Gon Jinn to his Padawan learner Obi-Wan Kenobi in 33 BBY. During the Clone Wars\u2014a conflict that consumed much of the galaxy between 22 BBY and 19 BBY\u2014Generis was located within Separatist-controlled space; however, in the year 20 BBY, Generis was one of the thousands of undecided worlds that had not made an out-and-out declaration for the Republic nor its opposing government, the Confederacy of Independent Systems."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the period of the Galactic Empire, Generis was under the jurisdiction of an Imperial Governor, but its residents were far removed from the effects of Imperial rule. In contrast, the Atrivis sector in which Generis was located was foremost among the territories active in resisting the Empire, with many isolated groups of freedom fighters. After one such group was massacred on Mantooine, many of the resistance groups began to cooperate, eventually forming the Atrivis Resistance Group. The ARG leaders chose the Generis system as their base of operations, establishing a secret base on an abandoned space station there. From there, the ARG harassed the Imperial forces throughout the sector. They were eventually visited by Mon Mothma, a senator intent on forging a pan-galactic Rebel Alliance. Although at first hesitant to join her, the leadership of the ARG eventually signed the Treaty of Generis with Mothma, bringing the ARG into the wider Rebel Alliance."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As part of the treaty, the Alliance built a Communications Center on Generis, selecting a site at its southern pole. It was located next to a large deposit of hiridiu crystal, which, merely by proximity, had the capacity to boost modern communications signal strength by as much as 30%. The Alliance was also impressed with the rugged terrain of Generis, knowing that if the base was ever discovered by the Empire, any attempt to capture or disable the center would require an extended ground campaign. The Alliance sent a team of engineers and technicians to construct the communications facility, as well as some starfighter docks as additional protection. The Alliance also supplied a full wing of 36 starfighters to the Atrivis forces, under the command of Wing Commander Varth. Six of these craft were permanently stationed on Generis to protect the Communications Center. Within six months, with an influx of Alliance training and resources, the ARG had became a fully operational Sector Force. The Rebel Alliance also sought S9-series heavy power droids for service on the planet, as the model was particularly appropriate for its rugged terrain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some eight months after the Battle of Yuvern in the Oplovis sector, the newly-coordinated communications system in the Atrivis sector bore fruit. The Imperial fleet in the neighboring Oplovis sector moved to attack Rebel forces on Mantooine, passing through the Generis system en route. When the Imperial forces emerged from hyperspace, three Alliance cruisers ambushed them, taking them completely by surprise. They defeated the Oplovis fleet without any major Alliance losses."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "New Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, the Empire suffered a critical defeat at the Battle of Endor, including the death of Emperor Palpatine. With fragmentation and infighting affecting much of the Empire, Grand Moff Ardus Kaine established the Pentastar Alignment, an Imperial faction that adhered to the principles of Emperor Palpatine's New Order but eschewed expansionism. Located with the New Territories, it included fifteen sectors within its borders, including Generis' own Atrivis sector, from 4\u201312 ABY. The Rebel Alliance, which transitioned into the New Republic after the Battle of Endor, did not engage with the Alignment, instead focusing their attention on other Imperial factions. They did maintain their presence on Generis, however, with its Communications Center becoming the prime New Republic communications nexus to and from the Outer Rim Territories, and shortly after Endor, they strengthened Generis base with the Cracken Flight Group led by Pash Cracken. For a short period, the Cracken Flight Group was left under the stewardship of Wing Commander Varth while Cracken volunteered with Rogue Squadron. Following the capture of Coruscant by the Republic in 7 ABY, Cracken returned to Generis. Later that year, all of the forces under Wing Commander Varth were temporarily moved toward the Core Worlds to cover some of the sectors formerly used by rogue Imperial warlord Zsinj, basing themselves out of Folor, a moon of Commenor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They had returned to Generis by 9 ABY, at which time the New Republic had suffered numerous losses against Grand Admiral Thrawn, a Chiss strategic mastermind who had returned from an extended placement in the Unknown Regions. As part of his campaign against the New Republic, Thrawn personally planned an assault against Generis. Carried out on 44:8:19, and utilizing some of his clone troops, the Imperial ground assault won a fierce battle, capturing the Communications Center largely intact, along with most of the sector fleet supply deposits. Cracken and his Flight Group were able to provide enough resistance to allow General Kryll to sneak out Commander-in-Chief Travia Chan and her support staff, and were also able to deny the Imperial forces any new ships; however, overall, the loss of the unique broadcasting center was a significant blow to the New Republic. Among the Imperial casualties was the stormtrooper Grodin Tierce; ten years later, Tierce was impersonated by members of the Imperial Remnant in a bid to take control of that government. Thrawn's forces later destroyed the Communications Center."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Grand Admiral Thrawn was subsequently defeated by the New Republic, assassinated by his own bodyguard. His second-in-command, Gilad Pellaeon, worked to consolidate the Empire's control in the New Territories, but was eventually pushed back to a mere eight sectors, with the Republic regaining control of Generis and the Atrivis sector. The Communications Center was rebuilt, which, in addition to servicing the Outer Rim, also became an important link to the Unknown Regions. While this held some strategic importance, it was never selected for sabotage by the Imperial Remnant, as they considered the Chiss\u2014the dominant power in the Unknown Regions\u2014to be too isolationist for the Republic to make any successful overtures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 25 ABY, the New Republic again came under substantial attack, this time from an extra-galactic species known as the Yuuzhan Vong. For the early years of the war, Generis was a Republic stronghold; however, in 28 ABY, a Yuuzhan Vong fleet retreating from an assault on the Imperial Remnant attacked Generis, having been alerted to the base by the presence of a Yuuzhan Vong spy using a communications villip. Although pursued by Grand Admiral Pellaeon aboard the Right to Rule, the Yuuzhan Vong managed to destroy the Communications Center, ravaging much of the planet's surface in the process. The Yuuzhan Vong force then continued on to the planet Esfandia, which had been established as a second Outer Rim communications base at the start of the war to serve as a redundant link to the Outer Rim and into the Unknown Regions alongside Generis. Esfandia almost fell to the same force, but Pellaeon's ships and the arrival of a rag-tag fleet of Ryn-affiliated starships managed to defeat the Yuuzhan Vong forces. The New Republic was soon able to repair the Generis facility and restore its communications capacity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the decades after the Yuuzhan Vong War, the Empire expanded its territories again, gaining control of the Atrivis sector by 41 ABY.

Wealthy travelers from off-world often visited the planet to experience its untamed wilderness, bringing along their children and staying at ranches such as that of Vistal Purn's family, located near the Atrivis River. These guests spent their time fishing, hunting, hiking, and rafting down the white-water rapids.
