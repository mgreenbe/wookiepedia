The ship consisted of an X-wing fuselage and engines, and solar panels from a TIE Fighter. The solar panels replaced the S-foils that were present on a standard X-wing."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Weaponry usually consisted of two laser cannons mounted on the fuselage, where the proton torpedo launchers were located on the X-wing, though some mounted the X-wing's lasers on the fuselage and others retained one warhead launcher at the price of carrying only a single laser. A far superior variant was the X-ceptor, which used TIE interceptor solar panels and thus had an armament comparable to that of a standard X-wing. Like many other uglies, this ship was barely spaceworthy, and used predominantly by pirates, smugglers, and other cash-poor groups. Though capable of harassing unarmed commercial vessels, these ships could be destroyed en masse by a single true starfighter."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Corellian Defense Forces were known to employ Uglies, including X-TIEs, during the disorganized period after the fall of the Empire.
