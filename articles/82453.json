The Vixen was too small to carry any kind of freight. It was an outdated model of a ship that had never been popular. It didn't appear to be armed, although it did have a small laser cannon that was pilot operated. It was slower than a landspeeder. It was so shabby and ordinary that it would have been easily overlooked. It was a perfect ship for reconnaissance. It could land just about anywhere. It had been fitted with a Class 1 hyperdrive, allowing it to travel through hyperspace at the same rate as an X-wing starfighter. It carried a tracking device that allowed the Resistance to monitor its movements when it reached an agreed-on destination. It was also programmed to purge its files and self destruct if it were ever to fall into enemy hands, essentially making it a suicide device. Rose had also fitted it with a power baffler that hid its energy trace."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
