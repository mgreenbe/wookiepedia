However, in late 2012, the online game, Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures released an expansion of their card game, \"Card Assault,\" which contained a card with an image of this droid, named TA-1313. Indeed the two tactical droids do look as if they were intended to be separate characters. In fact, TA-1313 bears a stronger resemblance to the T-series tactical droid on Kiros seen in Kidnapped than to TX-20, though it hasn't been confirmed if they are one and the same."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
