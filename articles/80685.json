She served under the command of High Lord Sarasu Taalon, when the Sith fleet allied with Luke Skywalker and his son, Ben, to eliminate Abeloth in the Maw. After spending time on Klatooine, the envoy of Sith and Jedi traveled to the Maw, where they eventually found Abeloth's planet. There, Luke Skywalker convinced the Sith that they should attempt to Mind Walk beyond shadows to locate Abeloth. While beyond shadows, Faal stumbled and was dragged to her death into the Depths of Eternity by long-dead enemies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Force-sensitive female Keshiri Leeha Faal was born on the planet Kesh. She served in the Sith armada, rising up to the rank of High Lord Sarasu Taalon's second in command aboard the ChaseMaster frigate Black Wave. In that capacity, she traveled with Taalon and ten other frigates to confront Luke Skywalker over Dathomir in order to form a formal alliance with Skywalker and his son, Ben, to eliminate the dark side being Abeloth in the Maw. In reality, however, the Sith hoped to force Abeloth to serve them, and then kill the Skywalkers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke Skywalker proposed they meet up with Lando Calrissian and his asteroid tug, the Rockhound for assistance in navigating the Maw. The Sith agreed, and they decided to wait for Calrissian at the planet Klatooine. There, Faal discovered the existence of the sacred Fountain of the Ancients, which she showed to Taalon. Taalon, impressed and possessed with a desire for the Fountain, formulated a plan to acquire samples of the Fountain's wintrium. Eventually, the Sith and Jedi decided to leave, and have Calrissian meet up with them shortly before entering the Maw. Taalon convinced Skywalker to allow him to leave two ships behind, under the premise that they were to wait for Calrissian. Skywalker agreed, and Taalon then gave Faal command of the Winged Dagger, relieving Syndor as Captain of the frigate. He then gave her orders to obtain wintrium from the Fountain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Jedi and the rest of the Sith had left the system, Faal passed on her orders to the Captain of the other Sith frigate that had been left behind, Vyn Holpur of the Starstalker. Holpur carried out the attack, although the Sith were eventually stopped as several Hutt ships arrived in-system, attacking the Starstalker and surrounding the Winged Dagger. Calrissian then arrived, along with Jedi Knight Jaina Solo, and they were called upon to mediate the crisis. Faal claimed that Holpur and his crew had acted completely upon their own authority, and although Calrissian and Solo knew she was lying, there was no evidence to convict her, as Holpur upheld her story. Holpur and his crew were thus sentenced to death, and Faal and the crew of the Winged Dagger then traveled with Calrissian and Solo in the Rockhound to meet up with the rest of the fleet outside the Maw."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After they discovered that their first stop inside the Maw, Sinkhole Station, had been destroyed, the convoy of Sith and Jedi agreed to travel straight to Abeloth's planet. There, Luke Skywalker convinced the Sith that they should Mind Walk in order to go beyond shadows and locate Abeloth. Taalon chose Faal and a Sith Saber, Gavar Khai, to accompany him. With Skywalker serving as their guide, they entered the Lake of Apparitions. While walking there, Faal slipped, falling to her hands and knees. She attempted to rise, but was suddenly set upon by the hands of her long-dead enemies and rivals. Taalon attempted to help her, but was held back by Khai, who recognized that it was too late as Faal was dragged down into the Depths of Eternity, killing her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leeha Faal was considered to be very beautiful by Humans and Keshiri alike; she had short black hair that framed her face, a slender body, and purple skin typical of the Keshiri race. She was particularly close to High Lord Taalon, whom she served obediently as his second in command. Later, she openly lied about her involvement in the attack on the Fountain of the Ancients, resulting in Holpur and his crew being condemned to death. Faal was embarrassed after her stumble in the Lake of Apparitions, although she quickly grew terrified as the hands of her past enemies began to drag her under the water, and she called desperately for Taalon to help her."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Leeha Faal first appeared in Fate of the Jedi: Allies, Christie Golden's second installment in the Fate of the Jedi series and the fifth novel in the series overall."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
