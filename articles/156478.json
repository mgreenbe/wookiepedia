The creature had two small wings slightly forward of the midpoint of its body, and black eyebrows situated above yellow eyes with black pupils. Mostly a single shade of purple, but with a paler snout and spots on its wings, the creature had a forked tongue and four fangs. Its body, which was long and flexible, sported a rattle at the end, and its head featured several spikes. In 3 ABY, the Ewoks Weechee Warrick, Widdle Warrick, Paploo, and Teebo frightened one such serpent when they passed through its cave on their way to the Tree of Light."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The flying serpent first appeared in \"The Tree of Light,\" the sixth episode of the Star Wars Legends animated series Ewoks' first season, which originally aired on October 12, 1985."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
