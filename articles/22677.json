Side effects included dizziness, blurred vision, muscle spasms, and muscle weakness. Bacta tank immersion or bed rest could cure it; if untreated, the affliction could become permanent. Calcification was caused by exposure to high-strength electric fields. It was also one of the after effects of exposure to Force lightning.
