Despite this high concentration of star systems with around 20,000 worlds, only a hundred or so planets bore life and only six produced sentient lifeforms. It was believed that seventeen planets outside the Duskhan League had lifeforms of some kind, but it was difficult to survey or contact them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Widek Bypass detoured around the cluster and the Metellos Trade Route terminated at it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Koornacht Cluster was known by the Fia as \"The Great Multitude of the Circle of the Heavens\" or simply \"The Multitude\", by the Wehttam as \"God's Temple\", by the Ka'aa as \"No'aat Padu'll\" or \"The Little Nursery\", by the Yevetha as \"Home\", and a number of other names."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Crucible had operations in the Koornacht Cluster through the Sungrazer cooperative which operated in 3964 BBY.
