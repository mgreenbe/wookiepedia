Large quantities of silkenfrond were grown in hydroponic plants in the capital city of Calimondretta on the icy planet of Syned. They were then processed into a thread at textile mills. Garments made from silkenfrond had a reputation of being warm and colorful, which resonated with the Sith Lord Arkadia Calimondra's philosophy of exploiting everyone's full potential."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
