Around 22 BBY, Comet participated in the Battle of Khorm, in which he fought against Separatist droid forces as the Clone Army struggled to secure the planet's agrocite deposits from the Khormai Warlord Unger Gout and the Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress. Comet was captured during the battle along with trooper Spitter, Commander Wolffe, and Major Kendal Ozzel.

As a clone trooper, Comet was born on the planet Kamino as a genetic copy of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett. During the Clone Wars, a conflict between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Comet was assigned to the Wolfpack, a clone trooper squad that was part of the 104th Battalion, and served under Jedi Master Plo Koon and Clone Commander CC-3636, nicknamed \"Wolffe.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 22 BBY, Comet, along with the rest of the Wolfpack and the 44th's Devil Dogs, participated in the Battle of Khorm to secure a rare ore called agrocite, mined because it could be used as fuel and also greatly enhanced beam weapons. Led by Jedi Masters Koon, Kit Fisto, and Tauht, as well as the recently promoted Major Kendal Ozzel, Comet and the Republic task force arrived on the planet Khorm. However, by the time they arrived there, the Khormai warlord Unger Gout had allied himself with the Separatists and enslaved his people to mine for the Confederacy. To make matters worse, the enemy had also built a weather-control station, creating a storm in Khorm's atmosphere that would prevent the Republic forces from using their air support until the station was destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the initial attack by the Republic, the task force managed to drive the Separatist Droid Army back from the agrocite processing facility, where Gout currently resided, forcing the warlord to abandon the plant. After capturing the facility, Masters Koon and Fisto took a clone unit and departed to destroy the weather station, placing Tauht in command of the Republic's current position. Tauht would later be killed by Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress, sent by the Confederacy to secure the planet, leaving Ozzel in charge. When the Confederacy mounted a counterattack, Ozzel ordered Comet and the rest of the Republic forces to leave their position at the facility and charge the enemy. Although they at first gained the upper hand against the battle droid forces, hidden spider droids surrounded the attack force with which Comet fought, destroying most of it. Comet, one of the few survivors of the battle, was taken prisoner alongside Ozzel, Wolffe, and trooper Spitter by Gout."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Comet and the other prisoners were held at the agrocite processing plant, once again under enemy control. He and the others escaped imprisonment after they managed to hot-wire the control panel to their cell. Commandeering an Armored Assault Tank, Comet and his fellow troopers destroyed any droids who tried to stop them as they escaped from the processing plant. Ventress, at the time engaged with the Republic force sent to destroy the weather-control station, was informed of their escape and raced to stop them. Comet and the others managed to reach a Republic staging point and rendezvous with the Republic troops located there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Ventress and her attack force tracked the group of escapees to the staging point, the droids launched their assault, and the commandeered Armored Assault Tank was immediately destroyed. The attack forced Comet and the remaining Republic troops to take cover behind the LAAT/i gunships and AT-TE walkers that had been frozen to the ground by Khorm's climate and rendered useless. As the battle at the staging point raged on, Republic troops under Masters Koon and Fisto managed to destroy the weather-control station, which allowed Republic forces under Admiral Wieler to reach the staging area. The reinforcements, which included V-19 Torrent starfighters and gunships, destroyed much of Ventress's attack force, causing her to order a retreat which saved Comet and the remainder of the ground force. The Republic forces on Khorm later triumphed, resulting in the securing of the agrocite resources and the death of Gout, which forced Ventress to flee the lost Confederate cause on Khorm."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rescue missions"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later in the war, after receiving word that Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker and Mace Windu had been trapped on the world Vanqor by bounty hunters, Comet and the Wolfpack departed from the galactic capital world of Coruscant for the Uziel system, tasked with rescuing the Jedi. Accompanied by Plo Koon and Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, Comet and the task force were flown down to the wreckage of the Venator-class Star Destroyer Endurance, where Windu and Skywalker had been trapped on the cruiser's bridge. Comet and the rescue team hovered outside of the Endurance's bridge in the LAAT/i Plo's Bros as the bridge began to give way. While the Jedi used the Force to prevent the bridge from falling as the Wolfpack troopers secured it to the gunship with ascension cables, Comet and Wolffe attempted to extract Windu and Skywalker from the bridge. Finding the Jedi trapped beneath debris from an explosion, Comet helped Windu from the rubble and into the gunship while Wolffe aided Skywalker in escaping. When both injured Jedi were on board, the gunship departed the wreckage, leaving the bridge to collapse seconds later. Briefly stopping at a staging point to load the Jedi onto gurneys, Comet and the task force departed from Vanqor along with the rescued Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Clone Wars raged on, Comet participated in a rescue of a Republic team sent to the planet Lola Sayu, a Confederate-controlled world. It was there that the Citadel stood, a high-security prison meant for important prisoners. The Republic team had been tasked with infiltrating the prison and rescuing Jedi Master Even Piell, who had recently been captured after he obtained the coordinates for the Nexus Route, a secret hyperspace lane that connected both Republic and Confederate worlds. The strike team had successfully rescued Piell and Captain Wilhuff Tarkin, who each knew half of the hyperlane coordinates. However, during their attempt to escape the planet, their shuttle was destroyed, and the team was forced to hide in the wilderness of Lola Sayu, waiting for the Republic attack force to come to their aid."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aboard a fleet of Venator-class Star Destroyers, Comet traveled to the Lola Sayu system with the attack force that was led by Koon and Commander Wolffe. There, the Republic force managed to break through the Lola Sayu defense fleet, and a space gunship containing Koon, Wolffe and Comet attempted an evacuation of the survivors of the rescue team. Comet and the retrieval team reached the extraction point in the gunship, where the survivors of the mission had just defeated a squad of commando droids on flying STAPs led by the Phindian warden of the prison, Osi Sobeck. As ranks of crab droids surrounded the extraction point and attempted to halt the escape, the remains of the rescue team boarded the gunship and departed for a fleet of Venator-class Star Destroyers that were engaged with the Confederate Navy above the planet. The gunship containing Comet and the others successfully boarded one of the cruisers, and the remnants of the Republic fleet departed for Coruscant, their mission a success."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Fighting on Felucia"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At a later point, Comet was present with Commander Wolffe and the Wolfpack on Felucia, a highly contested planet in the Outer Rim Territories, as they fought to free it from the droid forces occupying an outpost commanded by the T-series tactical droid TZ-33. Shortly after droid reinforcements sent by General Grievous arrived in a Confederate landing craft, Republic forces launched their assault, aiming to drive the Separatists back and eventually gain control of the planet. Republic AT-TE walkers targeted the enemy in the outpost and opened fire, causing TZ-33 to retaliate by opening up the front gate and sending a unit of spider droids to engage the walkers. Attempting to gain access to the Separatist outpost via the open entrance, an attack group led by Anakin Skywalker and Clone Captain CT-7567, nicknamed \"Rex,\" pounced on the droids as they exited the gate and plowed forward."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, Plo Koon led Wolffe and a squad of the Wolfpack over the left wall of the outpost to flank the droids by using their jetpacks, while Ahsoka Tano was in charge of a small division of clones including Comet, Sinker, and Boost, that was tasked with scaling the back wall and engaging the enemy from behind. Tano stopped the squad temporarily on the way to their objective when she sensed something. Even though she had unknowingly sensed the Trandoshan hunter Lo-Taren who was lurking nearby, Tano dismissed it as nothing, and Comet, the squad's second-in-command, ordered the men forward. The Corporal's squad reached the back wall of the outpost, and while Tano guarded the rear of their advance, he and the other troopers scaled the wall with their ascension cables after destroying the B1-Series battle droid guards."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Reaching the top, Comet and the squad rendezvoused with the rest of the Wolfpack as they captured the outpost. Tano, however, never scaled the wall behind her men, as she had been secretly captured by Lo-Taren, and Comet soon became aware of her disappearance. After the outpost had been taken and all droid forces including TZ-33 destroyed, Comet reported Tano's failure to check in to his Jedi commanders. He participated in the search for the missing Padawan along with the Republic forces in that area, though none of them uncovered her whereabouts, and he along with the rest of the searchers eventually abandoned the hunt when commanded by their superiors. Unbeknownst to Comet and the others, Tano had been taken off-world by Lo-Taren to be hunted on Trandosha's moon of Wasskah, though she later escaped from the moon."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mission to Kadavo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Comet and the Wolfpack were later dispatched to the planet Kadavo around 21 BBY, where Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, Rex, and captured Togruta colonists from the world Kiros were being held at a slave processing facility. Tasked with rescuing the prisoners and destroying the hub, Koon and a clone starfighter squadron destroyed the facility's defenses, allowing a Republic light cruiser helmed by Admiral Coburn to get close to the hub. The light cruiser, which held the members of the Wolfpack, came up under the facility to where the floor of the cell containing the Togruta prisoners was in the process of retracting, a trap that when fully opened would cause the Togruta to fall to their deaths in the volcanic crater below. On the bridge of the cruiser with Sinker and Wolffe, Comet followed his Commander out onto the cruiser's hull when Coburn ordered them to save the prisoners."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Equipped with jetpacks and blasters armed with ascension cables, Comet and the others arrived beneath the trapped Togruta. Using the jetpacks, they fired their ascension cables at the now-exposed ceiling of the holding cell, and the Togruta used the cables to descend to the ship below. During the evacuation, Comet caught one of the Togruta who fell from the cables and safely brought her down to the cruiser. With all of the prisoners out of the cell, Comet and the others descended into the cruiser as Coburn removed the ship from underneath the facility. After gunships rescued Kenobi and Rex from a landing pad, Koon ordered the gunships to open fire, and the resulting missile volley destroyed the processing hub's supports, demolishing the facility as it crashed into the volcano mouth over which it was situated."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Searching in the sand"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Clone Wars still raging circa 20 BBY, Comet and the Wolfpack were sent to the desert moon of Oba Diah alongside Master Koon in order to identify the source of a distress signal. With him and the Wolfpack dressed in sand-proof combat gear, Comet was at the forefront of a division of clone troopers, AT-TEs, and HAVw A6 Juggernauts as they searched for the source in the blowing sand on the moon. After combing a particular location where the source originated three times, Comet reported to Wolffe and Koon, who were in an A6 Juggernaut, that the clones on the ground had neither sighted nor scanned anything other than the billowing sand. Because of this, Comet suggested that they were searching in the wrong place. However, Koon ordered the Wolfpack to press on, and they shortly discovered the source of the distress signal, prompting Comet to order the contingent's vehicles to stop. The source turned out to be a crashed T-6 shuttle that had been used by the deceased Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas, and Koon had the T-6 shuttle transported back to Coruscant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Comet spoke Galactic Basic Standard, and, as a clone of Jango Fett, was 1.83 meters tall. Like Fett, he also had tan-colored skin. After commandeering an Armored Assault Tank on Khorm, Comet realized the enemy was at a disadvantage due to the tank that his forces possessed, and wanted to press the advantage. However, Major Kendal Ozzel ordered the troopers to escape from the agrocite processing facility, prompting Comet to obey his superior. Comet helped assist Commander Wolffe and his squad when they rescued Anakin Skywalker and Mace Windu from the precarious bridge of the Endurance, and also when he served as second-in-command during the raid on the back of the outpost on Felucia under Ahsoka Tano's command. He was complimented by Skywalker on Felucia after he and his squad completed their objective."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Early in the war, Comet donned clone cold assault armor emblazoned with red to participate in the Battle of Khorm without the negative affects of the cold on that planet, and would go on to use sand-proof combat gear on the moon of Oba Diah. Later in the war, he wore standard Phase I clone trooper armor, which he customized with a gray-blue color to honor the fallen members of the Wolfpack during the Battle of Abregado. Prior to the mission to Kadavo, Comet upgraded his Phase I armor to the second phase of the clone armor. Like his Phase I set, it featured the same colors. His weapon was a DC-15S, which was sometimes equipped with the ascension cable launcher that could be attached to the blaster. Occasionally, Comet used a jetpack for missions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Comet first appeared in 2009's graphic novel story arc In Service of the Republic, written by Henry Gilroy.
