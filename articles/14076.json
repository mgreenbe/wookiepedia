It was fought between the Imperial Army and member of Churhee's Riflemen. The Imperials had the Riflemen pinned down and launched a salvo of grenades as a prelude to your assault. However, utilizing Ubrikkian man traps, the grenades were forced to explode prematurely, neutralizing their effect. This blunted the Imperials' initiative, allowing the Riflemen to rally and push them back."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
