While serving in the Carida Academy, Han Solo and his fellow cadets were assigned to take the cruiser and transport several TIE fighter pilots. Kanina Nico took the position of captain on the cruiser, assigning the other cadets to their jobs. On their journey, Solo modified the cruiser to increase its speed, allowing them to finish their duties early so he could visit a Pantolomin cruiser and meet with the Ithorian Pjolan. After escaping, they returned the cruiser back to Carida."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
