The first-born child was responsible for running the business dealings of the family, and was known as \"the First.\" The First was assisted by the next two eldest sibling, known as \"the Second\" and \"the Third.\" If one of the trio died, the eldest child of that member was elevated to the position of Third, while the other members advanced in inheritance.
