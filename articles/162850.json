During the Galactic Civil War, Neena hired a smuggler and his crew to infiltrate the warehouse and steal prototypes of a new model of holocorder. The group managed to get into the warehouse and get the holocorders with no problems, but when they attempted to steal a Thelman Converter for themselves they bumped into one of the security droids, not noticing it was there for all the noise. This caused an alarm to be raised and all other security droids rushed to capture the group and all the gates closed. The group managed to get to the converters, however, and then stole a repulsorlift truck, driving it away. Though some security droids followed, they stopped at the gates as per their programming."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
