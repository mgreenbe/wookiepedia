The organization was based out of the planet Akana, but they also maintained a presence in other areas of the sector. The guild had a permanent place in the Perma within the Elrood Bazaar on the planet Elrood. This location, the largest such marketplace in the entire sector allowed their artwork to be seen by a multitude of beings and increased their sales considerably. One of the famous paintings done by the guild was known as The Lovers' Dilemma which had been created by the artist known as Walls. The painting hung within the guild's residence in the Elrood Bazaar, where it was displayed proudly."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
