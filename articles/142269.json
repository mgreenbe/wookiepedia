A champion speeder racer, he was almost killed in a crash two days before the birth of his son, Thall. Leaving the sport behind, he kept his past hidden from his son and years later refused to let Thall become a racer himself. A furious Thall stowed aboard a freighter bound for the planet Boonta. Only upon his father's death, at some point prior to 15 BBY, did Thall return to Beheboth and learn about his father's former career."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
