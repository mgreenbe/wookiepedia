A squadron of T-65B X-wing starfighters appears, led by General Hera Syndulla and her astromech droid Chopper. Hera orders her pilots to stay with their wingmates, as they need to protect the slower Y-wings. Cleat says that the Imperials have numbers, but they have talent, and Mart Mattin responds that that goes double for him. Chopper beeps that it's triple for him, prompting Hera to sigh in exasperation. She orders her squadron to lock their S-foils in attack position. On the bridge of the Star Destroyer Chimaera, Grand Admiral Thrawn, entering the bridge, states that the Rebels have finally come to Lothal. Commander Woldar informs the Grand Admiral that they are counting 24 ships. Thrawn orders fighters launched, and tells his best pilot, Vult Skerris, that the Rebels must not be allowed to reach the planet's surface. As the TIE fighters are launched, Hera tells her pilots to accelerate to attack speed, and the fighting begins."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Down below, as a siren wails, the Spectres Ezra Bridger, Sabine Wren, Garazeb Orrelios and Kanan Jarrus plant explosives on the turrets of the air defenses installed to protect the Imperial Armory Complex. Zeb asks Sabine if she's sure that the explosives are powerful enough, and when she responds yes, he says that the towers are much larger up close. As the Rebels hide from a watching stormtrooper, Ezra contacts Ryder Azadi, who reports that his team is done planting their explosives, and says he'll meet them at the rendezvous. Ezra responds that they only have one tower left, and they sign off. Sabine notes that Hera will be there any minute."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Up above, the X-wings shoot down many TIE fighters. Hera tells Mart, Phoenix Two, to handle a wingman, and he shoots down another TIE, which crashes into a light cruiser. She compliments him on his shot, before ordering Phoenix Four and Five, Cleat and Duke, to thin out the Imperials. Cleat confirms the orders, before she and her wingmate attack. She tells Duke to keep up, and he responds that he's trying. As the two pilots shoot down TIEs, Vult Skerris enters the fray in his gold-striped TIE/D Defender Elite. He tells his two wingmen to stay on him and comes in behind Duke. Cleat warns him that he's picked up three more, but Duke is swiftly shot down by Skerris. He then pursues Cleat and fires on her, taking out one of her engines. She reports that she's lost control, and Hera responds, telling Cleat to scissor right so she can cut them off. As Phoenix Four flees, Skerris shoots her down, and Hera attacks him, taking out both of his wingmen. As she flies past, Skerris realizes who she is based on the piloting skill and pursues."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The turrets on Lothal begin firing, just as Zeb places the last explosives on the tower. Ezra, Sabine and Kanan pull up on speeder bikes, and upon getting confirmation that Zeb is done, Ezra tells him to hop on. Zeb responds by telling Ezra that that's not how this works, before yanking him out of the driver's seat and putting him on the back of the bike, and sitting in the seat himself. The Rebels escape, and Sabine presses a detonator, setting off the explosives and causing the towers to neatly collapse in on themselves. Governor Arihnda Pryce reports to Thrawn via hologram that her air defenses have been destroyed, and he states that it is an impressive but not unexpected level of coordination. Pryce responds that the factory is vulnerable, but Thrawn is unconcerned, stating that none of the Rebel ships will get past his blockade."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Amid the space battle, Skerris pursues Hera, but is unable to land a hit. She bemoans that he is too fast, before getting an idea and telling Chopper to hang on. Hera leads the Imperial ace towards the Chimaera, causing Skerris to wonder where she is going. Thrawn is alerted to an X-wing approaching on an attack vector, and orders Skerris to break off. He refuses, responding that he almost has Hera in his sights. Thrawn remarks that it is unfortunate, before ordering his gunners to open fire. A subordinate expresses concern about Skerris, and Thrawn responds that the Commander is playing into Hera's hands before repeating the order. The Chimaera's guns fire, bringing down both Hera and Skerris' shields. Hera tells Chopper to tighten his bolts, before heading in. Thrawn approaches the windows and sees Hera and Skerris fly past. Hera fires upon the Chimaera's scanning array, creating a cloud of smoke, and she closes her attack foils and flies through. Skerris loses track of her in the smoke and, due to his fighter's larger profile, is forced to fly around the scanning array. Hera turns her fighter around, and when Skerris appears, she fires upon him, catching him by surprise, and takes off two of his Elite's wings. Skerris spirals out of control, screaming, and his fighter crashes into a light cruiser. Mart, watching, is impressed and congratulates Hera. The cruiser's magazine is damaged by the strike, and it begins to explode and veer out of control. It crashes into a Star Destroyer, shearing off the bridge superstructure.

They are shortly attacked by a large number of TIEs, already firing their cannons. Outside Lothal City, the Spectres rendezvous with Ryder and Jai Kell, and Ezra says that they should be seeing Hera's force any minute now. They see trails descending on the city, which then begin to explode. Zeb asks what those are, as Ezra and Sabine look through electrobinoculars to see the Rebel fighters being shot down and destroyed. Ezra, shocked, asks about it as Sabine, horrified, confirms that it's the entire attack force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thrawn is informed that the entire attack force was destroyed, but several Rebel fighters managed to crash-land in the city, including that of the Flight Leader, but the factories are undamaged.

On the burned plains, Sabine sees Imperial gunships incoming, and Kanan tries to contact Hera on his comlink.

Several civilians approach, and a woman warns Hera that Imperial forces are coming, advising her to cut through the market and head for the east gate. When several gunships approach, the civilians flee, and Hera hides from the spotlights.

Ezra responds that he understands, and says they'll see him back at base. As Kanan departs, Sabine expresses her disapproval, suggesting that they should also go and find Hera, and Ezra responds that Kanan will find her.

She orders the pilot taken away for interrogation, and is then informed that the Rebel Flight Leader's starfighter has been located, but the pilot and astromech are missing. Knowing that Hera is the pilot they are searching for, Pryce orders the district locked down and torn apart, building by building, until she is found. In the dark city streets, Hera and Chopper happen upon an Imperial blockade. Hera tells Chopper that if they move fast, they can get past before reinforcements arrive. Before they can do anything, however, Chopper alerts Hera to a distress beacon coming from another astromech. Following it, they find the crash site of another Rebel starfighter. Stormtroopers confront the pilot, Mart, who is injured and being defended by his droid, R3-A3."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The stormtroopers attempt to capture R3, as they need his memory banks, and one snaps to just immobilize him. R3 is shot and deactivated, to Mart's horror. Hera, watching, tells Chopper to wait, and ambushes the driver of a nearby troop transport. As she drives up, Mart sees her at the controls, but the troopers don't, and wonder what the driver is doing. This gives Mart an opening to knock down one of the troopers and steal a blaster, which he uses to shoot another. The third trooper is run over by Hera, who asks Mart if he's okay. He responds that he's at least in one piece, and Hera comes over to inspect R3. The stormtrooper Mart knocked down comes to and attempts to attack, but is taken out by Chopper from behind. Hera asks Mart if it's okay to remove the transmitter from the downed R3, to replace Chopper's broken one, as there is no other way to get out of their situation. He gives her permission, stating that R3 would want to be able to help other Rebels, and Hera gets to work as Mart stands guard."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Elsewhere, Rukh, prowling through the city, finds a scent, and sets off.

Hera tells Mart and Chopper to run before shooting back, and the three Rebels flee with the assassin in pursuit. Mart asks Hera where they are going, and she tells Chopper to scan for the nearest sewer hatch. Once he finds the direction, Chopper leads the way through the city streets. Rukh pursues them over the rooftops. In a narrow street, Mart sees the assassin on the roofs, and shoots at him. Rukh swiftly descends to street level and attacks, quickly disarming Mart and kicking him into Hera. The assassin then fights Hera hand-to-hand, and she eventually manages to disarm him of his electrostaff. He knocks her to the ground shortly after, just as Mart comes to. Rukh reclaims his staff and activates it, raising it over Hera, only to be shocked by Chopper from behind. As Mart shoots at him, Rukh retreats to the rooftop.

Kanan in anger shouts for the wolf, demanding to know where it is, before making it clear that he does not have time for diversions like this as he walks back to his bike. He says that if the wolves want to help, that's fine, but as he grabs the handlebars of his bike he demands that they otherwise stay out of his way. Kanan turns to find the wolf sitting in front of him, and lets go of his bike, startled, as the creature growls. He asks it what it wants, and the wolf says \"Dume\"\u2014Kanan's original name\u2014as the two other wolves approach from behind.

Hera asks the droid where the sewer hatch is, and Chopper looks around the corner to discover it is guarded by stormtroopers and an AT-DP.

Mart asks if they have any other options, and Hera responds that there is no time as Imperial forces are closing in.

Hera, in a nearby street, orders Chopper to get the hatch open. The droid flies down from the roof and plugs into the port at the sewer hatch, as Hera takes the controls of the parked landspeeder. Mart hides among several large crates as the walker moves past, and the stormtrooper looks behind them. When he's not looking, Mart jumps him from behind and takes him out after a brief struggle.

In the sewers, Mart and Chopper follow the starbirds to a hatch, and Mart bangs on it. He hopes that it isn't locked. The hatch opens to reveal Kanan, who helps Mart and Chopper out. Chopper beeps, and Kanan responds that he knows she did. Mart apologizes to Kanan for not saving Hera. Kanan tells Mart that there was nothing else he could have done to help Hera, but that there is something Kanan can do.
