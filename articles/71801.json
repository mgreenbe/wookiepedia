The weapon, which Malli used to activate the onboard weapons systems of the Jedi Vectors she piloted, was powered by a kyber crystal Malli had taken from an ancient Sith lightspear. Malli had purified the crystal of the rage and pain instilled in it by its original owner mainly to see how such a thing was done, out of intellectual curiosity, but found herself bound tightly to it afterwards, eventually mounting it in her primary weapon. She once used the lightsaber to cut her way into an airspeeder being used to steal construction materials on Coruscant, while pursuing the thieves with her Padawan, Reath Silas. Malli later used the saber to activate her Vector's weapons systems during the Battle of Kur, in which she died."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jora Malli's lightsaber first appeared in the 2021 novel The High Republic: Light of the Jedi, written by Charles Soule.
