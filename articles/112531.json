For example, the insignia of a captain comprised two equally sized dots centered on the same vertical line, as exemplified by Captain Hera Syndulla of the rebellion, and Captain Cassian Andor of the Alliance. The Alliance generals Dodonna, Willard, Draven, and Rieekan all wore a badge with five dots arranged in a quincunx. As a commander, Luke Skywalker wore a 3-blue rank badge with the double-dot row at the bottom. Major Bren Derlin's badge had three red dots arranged with two on the top row, and the remainder below and between them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Rank insignia"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to the Legends roleplaying book The Rebel Alliance Sourcebook, the color of the pips indicates the branch of service, with blue designating navy and red designating army.
