Emperor Palpatine's rule of the Galactic Empire saw the construction of a primary Imperial HoloNet relay communications base called Altratonne Station on the planet's surface as a means to communicate with this region of the Rim. Because the planet was regularly showered with solar flares from the star, communications were often times disrupted. It wasn't long into the Galactic Civil War that the station on the planet was targeted by agents of the Rebel Alliance and a strike team led by Commander Lav Bilsek set out to destroy it. Fleeing the doomed facility, the Imperial agents monitoring communications were able to evacuate before the station was destroyed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet Altratonne was created for the Star Wars Miniatures Battles Companion, published in 1994.
