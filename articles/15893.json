In reality, he was little more than an Imperial puppet. Although his people, the Trunsks, were regarded as a slave species by the Empire, he did little to alleviate their suffering. While he publicly spoke out against the practice, he had a secret agreement with the local Moff allowing Imperials and other slavers to take Trunsks off-world. Belgoa was, however, allowed final say over which Trunsks would be taken. Belgoa ensured that his enemies were the first to be taken away. Under Belgoa's rule, the Trunsks were forbidden by Imperial law to carry personal weapons or to pilot armed starships. These laws were strictly enforced by Belgoa's police force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
