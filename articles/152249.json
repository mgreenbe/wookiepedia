As a Chuhkyvi, the individual had tan skin pigmentation, yellow eyes, four-fingered hands and a keen sense of smell. The young Chuhkyvi was inspired by the example of Kiro, a Chuhkyvi who became a folk hero among his species as the \"First to Swim,\" a designation he received for leaving Iskalon. Kiro, also a Force-sensitive, fought alongside Luke Skywalker and was offered Jedi training by the Rebel commander, although he ultimately turned down that opportunity. Sometime after 4 ABY, the young Chuhkyvi was inspired to similarly leave the ocean-homeworld of Iskalon, and became a Jedi in the New Jedi Order."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Chuhkyvi Jedi was Force-sensitive and had an intense hatred for dishonesty and lawlessness.
