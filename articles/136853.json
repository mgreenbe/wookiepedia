The ship would be stationed on the planet Sulon outside of the city of Barons Hed at the fuel complex Fuel City when it was chosen for the meeting place between the droid 8t88 and the Dark Jedi. The Dark Jedi Pic and Gorc were sent there to eliminate the droid, which they did. The Rebel agent and Jedi Knight Kyle Katarn was tailing the droid and sneaked aboard before the freighter had departed from the fuelling station."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Entering through the upper cargo door, Katarn had to make his way down to the shuttle docking bay while facing Imperial Remnant forces. Pic and Gorc were waiting for him and duelled with Katarn, but were defeated by the rebel agent who escaped from the ship shortly afterwards. The Sulon Star would continue its journey to join up with Jerec's fleet of star destroyers, and his main flagship Vengeance.\nThey would the resume their journey together and head for the Valley of the Jedi on the planet Ruusan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time after, While the ship was docked, whether by accident or design, Jerec knocked Kyle Katarn into the ship's hold after he refused to give in to the dark side and strike down his partner, Jan Ors. The vessel itself, which had received the full blast of Jerec's Force power, began to lose its hold on the docking station where it was moored. The supports gave way, and the ship, whose systems had been knocked offline, began to plummet into a deep canyon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Frantically searching the falling ship, eventually Kyle found his own vessel, the Moldy Crow, which had been tethered to the craft's underside. Katarn managed to board his ship and escape the Sulon Star just before it smashed into the canyon floor. However, the shockwave from the explosion caused the Crow to crash as well."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sulon Star was first shown in previews for the PC-game Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II. In promotional material it could be seen docked to a fuel station in space with the Outrider from Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire parked nearby, a multimedia project which was in production at the same time as the game. Another image showed the Sulon Star approaching the Imperial Palace on Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The ship appears as a playable setting in seven levels in the game, named \"Fuel Station Launch\", \"8t88's Reward\", \"Gorc and Pic - The Brothers of the Force\", \"Escape With the Map\", \"The Falling Ship\" and \"Into the Darkside\". During the latter two levels, the player is able to find consoles which triggers engines that slows down the ships descent but does not stop its inevitable crash. The wreckage of the ship may be entered in level 16, \"Sariss - Jedi Battleground\"."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
