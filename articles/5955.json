It held the Dagger of Mortis. It was located in a deep cave at the bottom of a staircase, and it was surrounded by a green aura of fire, which one had to cross in order to retrieve the mystical weapon. It was designed so that certain members of the family of Force wielders resident on the planet, called the \"Overlords\" or \"The Ones,\" could not retrieve the dagger."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After luring the Chosen One, Anakin Skywalker, to Mortis, the Force wielder known as the Father was betrayed by one of his children, the Son. In an effort to stop the Son, the Daughter took Obi-Wan Kenobi to the Altar and informed him that, while she could go no further, he could retrieve the Dagger in order to stop the Son."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the weapon materialized before the Jedi Master, Kenobi took it to Skywalker, but the dagger was seized by his Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who was under the Son's influence. The Son then gained control of the dagger and accidentally killed the Daughter, before the Father turned the dagger against himself, rendering the Son vulnerable enough for Skywalker to slay him. With this, balance in the Force was restored to Mortis, but a blinding white light from the Father's monastery made the entire realm disappear."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
