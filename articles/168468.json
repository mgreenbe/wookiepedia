At some point, Zirchros learned the location of the artifacts, and he also had a large amount of knowledge of the early criminal underworld of the Galactic Republic. When Zirchros came into possession of the artifacts, he kept them a secret. Around the year 3641 BBY, Zirchros was dying in his medical facility at the age of 1,700 years.

In a crew skill mission, the player sends one of their companions to complete the mission, but due to the mission being available to all classes, it is unknown who met with Zirchros. As a reward for the mission, the player receives some lost artifact fragments. The player can choose not to send their companion of the mission, so it is not guaranteed that anyone met with Zirchros."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
