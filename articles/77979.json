The stones were used to help crush food eaten by them, and over time, they became rounded because of how much they moved around. They could be found in colors such as blue, green, red, white and black. Due to a refractive quality peculiar to the pearl, they could be used in a lightsaber if properly cleaned, prepared and installed, though it was a difficult task. The pearls were seen as exceptionally valuable by the public (easily worth upwards of a hundred thousand credits each), as well as proof a person had killed a krayt dragon (to Tusken Raiders, a sign of bravery)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An illustrious owner of one of these famous pearls was Revan, who got it in exchange for helping Komad Fortuna kill an enormous canyon krayt that was nesting inside a cave near Anchorhead.
