It was brewed from many sources, including the venom of a kouhun, and kept in the Necropolis of Mataou. Those who wanted to join the society had to drink some of that liquid as part of their initiation rite, although they would not learn of its high toxicity until after the rite was accomplished. Without treatment, the body of the drinker would start corrupting slowly. Over weeks, he or she would become severely impaired both physically and mentally. The Kouhun society, however, would administer a cure to those hopefuls who would survive the initiation tests with the poison coursing in their veins. The substance was also used by the Nightsisters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
