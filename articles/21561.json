About the size of a human fingernail, butcherbugs were not very dangerous on their own. However, these insects could potentially be very deadly. Their silk, once hardened, was very sharp, and any creature running into the web was not captured, but torn to shreds. A humanoid could even be seriously injured by these webs if caught traveling at a high velocity. The butcherbug was also covered in green chitin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Butcherbugs were first mentioned in The Illustrated Star Wars Universe, a Star Wars Legends reference book which showcased concept art drawn by Ralph McQuarrie with text by Kevin J.
