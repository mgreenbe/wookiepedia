He tried to sell it to a group of Nikto, but rescinded the deal when he learned that the Nikto were part of the Guiding Hand gang, which was performing raids against the Hutt holdings, as Cedrax was afraid of the Hutts' revenge. Cedrax later gave the weapon to the Jedi Consular who tried to infiltrate the Guiding Hand. The Jedi used the weapon to prove their expertise to the Red Light Lancers tech gang, a part of the Guiding Hand."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
