Salus's goal for designing the DF-D1 was to reduce the FC-1 to a rifle-sized platform. As a result, the DF-D1 possessed twin canisters of needlelike flechettes, which would detonate and create a cloud of fast-moving razor-sharp debris."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, before Salus could put it for sale, the DF-D1 was banned due to its lethality. Despite being banned, it found use among Rodian big game hunters who hunted nexu, dragonsnakes, or rathtars, and was featured in Rodia's annual Atiang hunting awards. There were also a number of bounty hunters and mercenaries who wielded the DF-D1."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
