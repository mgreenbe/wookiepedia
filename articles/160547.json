However, he also built his works so that they would not work if someone changed the crystals or energy cells. He worked for a long time with the celtronist Dejah Duare, who helped him organize exhibitions and sales pitches and became a good friend. Around 19 BBY, the artist heard rumors that his homeworld of Caamas had been destroyed by newly appointed Emperor Palpatine; in fact, that day many of the planet's population died. That same day, Ves began his next work and was finally visited by Baron Vla\u00e7an Umber, one of Ves best customers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After having a conversation with Baron Vla\u00e7an Umber and his wife, Kirma Umber, who arrived at the artist's residence and in a heated conversation asked him not to sell her husband any artworks, which would otherwise plunge her family into debt. However, Ves refused this, whereupon the Baroness left him angry. That was when Ves was killed the same night when he was stabbed to death by an Umber 3PO unit - acting on his own initiative. With the circumstances of his death still uncertain, his partner Duare did not rely on the official authorities, led by prefect Pol Haus, but also hired Jax Pavan, Den Dhur and the droid I-5YQ, who ultimately died revealed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
