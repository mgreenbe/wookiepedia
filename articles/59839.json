The eastern side of that area of Harte Secur had a prefab shelter, a shield generator, a War Center with a power core and a turret next to it, two prefab shelters next to a heavy weapons factory, another power core, a troop center, a fortress, another power core and a Research Center. The center of Harte Secur was surrounded by walls in a rectangular formation, with a large archway leading into it. Inside it was a body of water surrounded by a fenced path. A total of six obelisks were placed in an even formation on both sides of the water.

Directly south of the city was a base that contained a research center, two turrets, and a power core. The base was on a paved path and was surrounded by a light wall, with a gate on its eastern side. The gate was on a pathway that led northwards, eventually splitting off into the eastern and central entrances to Harte Secur. The river that surrounded Harte Secur flowed south on the western side of the city, surrounding the research base before flowing to the east. On the path to the western entrance to city there was a small fishing facility consisting of two shipyards, an animal nursery, a turret, a sentry post, and a power core. Five utility trawlers gathered fish from the river there. The wesetern path out of the city led down south to the Harte Secur Airbase, run by the Naboo Airforce.

The Trade Federation Droid Army established a camp directly south of Harte Secur. Early in the invasion, the Royal Naboo Security Forces team Force Command Two successfully captured a droid control program from the Trade Federation battle droid OOM-14. It was taken to the Harte Secur research base, where the program was used to deactivate OOM-14's forces at the nearby camp. Wary that the program could be duplicated and used to turn the Droid Army against him, Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray tasked the B1-Series battle droid OOM-9 with retrieving the droid control program. OOM-9 was first sent to the Deactivated Camp, where he rendezvoused with a task force sent to retrieve the program, which included five droidekas, a bio cannon, and a Neimoidian technician."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The task force marched towards the research base using the eastern path, fighting groups of soldiers from Harte Secur that guarded the path, also using the bio cannons to destroy the turrets there. At the base, OOM-9 used the cannon to destroy the turrets there, with the droidekas protecting it from the Naboo troopers there. The technician retrieved the droid control program, after which the task force returned to the Deactivated Camp to reactivate the battle droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Harte Secur appears in both the Trade Federation and Gungan campaigns in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
