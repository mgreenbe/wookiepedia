It was discovered early in the history of the Galactic Republic. As one of the galaxy's dumping grounds, Lotho Minor's surface was covered with mountains of trash amassed over untold generations, which brought salvage operations to the planet in search of machinery that could still be repurposed. Planets such as Naboo dumped their trash there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following his defeat at the Battle of Naboo, with his body shattered, the Sith Lord Darth Maul went into exile in the bowels of Lotho Minor, where he lost his mind. To escape the planet, he sent out a transmission, offering a great sum of credits for capture of himself in hopes of luring a starship that he could escape in. The transmission was intercepted by the droid Captain Spikewheel and her crew of scavenger hopefuls; however, Maul's attempt to flee the planet failed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The crazed Sith was eventually found by his brother, Savage Opress, over a decade after the former's defeat on Naboo. During the Galactic Civil War, the Duros Akar Duel ruled over a collection of monster droids built from Lotho Minor's scrap and claimed the planet as his own, but his servants turned against him and gained their freedom after encountering the Rebel Alliance droid C-3PO."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A stormy, desolate terrestrial planet, Lotho Minor was located beyond the Western Reaches in the Lotho Minor system, which itself was located in the northern part of the Outer Rim Territories' Wazta sector. The closest\u2014and largest\u2014trade route to the world was the Lutrillian Cross. Lotho Minor had a surface covered with enormous mountains of trash piled over countless generations, and had more junk than even the planet Raxus Prime. No approach vectors that could be used to enter the atmosphere were established. The gutted and rotting hulls of ancient starships poked through the more recent garbage, lending its landscape the eerie feel of an industrial graveyard. Foul-smelling fog limited visibility, while huge pools of toxic sludge and periodic bursts of deadly acid rain made the hot, caustic planet's ruined ecosystem one of the most dangerous in the galaxy. Strong winds blew the junk across the planet. A mechanical debris field known as the Wreck Belt orbited Lotho Minor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The planet also contained pits, which were the subject of slang used as an interjection for surprise: \"What in the pits of Lotho Minor?\" The smuggler Han Solo uttered the phrase upon confronting infant sarlaccs that could move during the reign of the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic dumping ground"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite its being located beyond the Western Reaches\u2014a very remote location\u2014Lotho Minor was discovered in the early days of the Galactic Republic. It was quickly designated as a junk repository after it was discovered that very few sentient species were indigenous to the planet\u2014the few that were did not matter to the Republic's self-interested politicians or corporations. While the Republic initially tried to control the traffic destined for Lotho Minor with the help of several large mega-corporations, the lack of a permanent presence or Republic space station that could be used to patrol the surface allowed anyone who wished to send their waste and junk to the planet's surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, the planet Naboo came to send its untreatable waste and contaminated coolant there through an automatic refill system, and drone barges ferried junk from the moon Cymoon 1 to Lotho Minor. Cargo ships routinely dropped holds of garbage onto the planet with little concern for what became of it nor for any security measures, often doing so without warning. Centuries before the Clone Wars, immense refuse incinerator droids were programmed to incinerate Lotho Minor's garbage. As centuries went on, Lotho Minor's pollution drove all of its few sentient species to extinction. While most non-native species equated Lotho Minor to Hell, it was considered a legendary haven by Jawas, Squibs, and Ugors. Due to its horrible, dangerous conditions, few scavengers or junk dealers risked visiting the world, although those that did did so regularly in order to find parts that they could sell. A number of the more careful junk dealers even chose to engage with Lotho Minor's population of Junkers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the year 20 BBY, those enormous machines continued to labor among the mountains of garbage. Those unfortunate enough to live on Lotho Minor did not know the droids' origins and referred to them simply as \"fire-breathers.\" Salvage operations also dug through the planet-wide junkyard, looking to reclaim and recondition reusable or obsolete machinery, and Lotho Minor came to be known as the Junk World."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Darth Maul's exile"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After his defeat at the hands of the Jedi Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi during the Battle of Naboo in 32 BBY, the shattered body of Darth Maul, a Dathomirian Zabrak Sith Lord, was dumped amid Lotho Minor's junk. Maul lived in hiding for more than a decade in the caves beneath Lotho Minor's surface, subsisting off trash and vermin, but his driving desire to cling to life pushed him to rebuild himself with spider-like legs made of the planet's scrap metal, in place of his severed ones. An Anacondan known as Morley cut a deal with Maul in order to survive, agreeing to lure unwitting prey into Maul's clutches in return for his leftovers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, Maul attempted to escape Lotho Minor by sending out a transmission, offering a great sum of credits for capture of himself in hopes of luring a starship that he could escape in. The transmission would eventually be heard by Spikewheel, the droid captain of the starship Salvage-1, who traveled to the planet a week later. She stranded the Nikto Gritz, who aspired to become the droid's first mate and was tasked with capturing Maul, along with three other crew member hopefuls\u2014the human Brennar, the Theelin Riki, and the Roonan Seles\u2014to serve as bait. Not long after Spikewheel left the group on the planet surface, they fell into Maul's subterranean lair subsequent to a quick scuffle with each other."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trying to find their way within the dark labyrinth, Maul quietly grabbed Seles and separated him from the rest of the group, but Brennar soon found both Maul and the captured Roonan. As the duo was about to be killed by the insane Zabrak, Gritz managed to ensnare Maul in an electronet and save them. The recruits later returned to Spikewheel with the captured Zabrak aboard the Salvage-1. Before the ship could leave the planet's atmosphere, Maul freed himself and attacked the scavengers, splitting the droid captain in half. Riki subsequently opened the ship's rear hatch to ditch Maul; however, Gritz and the remains of his captain also fell from the ship along with Maul during the process, leaving the hapless Nikto to be killed by Maul while other recruits escaped the planet. Years later, Vane\u00e9, the Sith Lord Darth Vader's attendant, told the story of the salvagers to scare his prisoner, rebel Lieutenant Thom Hudd, at Vader's castle."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Brothers reunited"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lotho Minor remained neutral during the Clone Wars. In 20 BBY, Mother Talzin of the Dathomirian Nightsisters tasked Savage Opress with finding Maul, his long-lost brother, and gave him the Talisman of Finding to aid in his quest. On the planet Stobar, the talisman guided Opress to some dust clinging to an assortment of cargo crates that were being transported by a Sakiyan cargo hauler. Opress learned that the Sakiyan's Turtle Tanker had recently visited Lotho Minor and forced the hauler to take him there. When they arrived, Opress dropped the Sakiyan out of the ship in mid-air."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While scouring the planet's endless garbage wastes for his brother, Opress encountered Morley, who guided him past such threats as the enormous fire-breathers and a tribe of territorial Junkers. Morley lured Opress into Maul's lair, believing Lotho Minor's newest guest would be their next meal. At first, the two brothers wrestled with each other in the dark labyrinth of garbage, but Opress quickly recognized Maul and saw that his brother's mind had been shattered by his long-ago defeat. When Morley interrupted them to check on the status of their meal, Opress strangled the Anacondan to death for his treachery. At Opress's prodding, Maul soon remembered himself and vowed revenge on the Jedi.

Sometime after the Battle of Yavin, a team of rebels consisting of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia Organa, Chewbacca, and the protocol droid C-3PO traveled to Lotho Minor aboard the starship Millennium Falcon in search of a suitable location for a new base.

The tribal denizens appeared to be a strange hybrid of organic life and mechanical debris, and no one was quite sure of their origin. Lotho Minor's role as a galactic dumping ground and the Junkers' violent territoriality discouraged any deep exploration into their culture or biology. The Junkers lived off the scrap found on their homeworld's surface, augmenting their strange and twisted bodies with cybernetic enhancements, which replaced their missing limbs that were lost to corrosive chemicals, radiation, or accidents.
