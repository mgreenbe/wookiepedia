A veteran of the Galactic Empire, Peavey went on to serve as a military officer in the armed forces of the First Order approximately three decades after the Empire's ultimate defeat in the Galactic Civil War. As a member of the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Finalizer's senior staff, Peavey served under the command of General Armitage Hux\u2014the illegitimate son of his contemporary, General Brendol Hux. Although he regarded his commanding officer as an example of nepotism and incompetence, the Imperial veteran was a professional officer who kept his opinions to himself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Belonging to the generation of Imperial veterans who founded the First Order, Edrison Peavey survived the fall of the Galactic Empire which, in turn, led to the rise of the New Republic at the conclusion of the Galactic Civil War in 5 ABY. A contemporary of General Brendol Hux, the founder of the First Order stormtrooper training program, Peavey served with Hux's illegitimate son, General Armitage Hux aboard the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Finalizer. He was at the general's side when the First Order Navy deployed a fleet of Star Destroyers to the planet D'Qar, where Peavey noted that their forces had caught the Resistance in the middle of an evacuation. Peavey's comment irritated Hux, who regarded the older officer as a relic of the Imperial Era."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Under normal circumstances, Peavey commanded the Finalizer in Hux's absence due to his status as the command ship's captain. This time, however, he was transferred along with his general to the Mega-class Star Dreadnought Supremacy\u2014Supreme Leader Snoke's flagship\u2014following the Resistance's escape from D'Qar. Utilizing cutting edge technology to track the Resistance fleet through hyperspace, the First Order pursued their prey to the Crait system but was unable to eliminate them outright, much to Hux's aggravation. Peavey informed his younger commanding officer that the Supremacy was too slow due to her size; while the Resistance could not escape the Star Dreadnought, they could at least keep their smaller starships out of the turbolasers' range. The First Order maintained their pursuit of the Resistance, forcing their vessels to burn through their fuel reserves. Meanwhile, Hux ordered Peavey to have the Supremacy's gunners continue the barrage, wanting the Resistance to know they were still being followed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Resistance's support ships were destroyed one by one, leaving the MC85 Star Cruiser Raddus vulnerable and dangerously low on fuel. Upon learning that the Raddus was merely a distraction, Hux ordered Peavey to ignore the Resistance flagship and concentrate the Supremacy's turbolasers on the group of transports ferrying the Raddus's crew to the planet Crait. Peavey noted the Raddus began changing course but Hux ordered him to ignore the cruiser, believing it was only attempting to draw the First Order's attention away from the transports. By the time they realized that the Raddus was preparing to enter hyperspace while facing in the Supremacy's direction, it was too late. Despite their efforts to save the Supreme Leader's flagship, the Raddus crashed through the Supremacy at lightspeed, tearing the dreadnought in half and destroying several Star Destroyers in the process. However, both Peavey and Hux survived the attack and deployed the First Order army to Crait where the Resistance took refuge in an outpost that once belonged to the Alliance to Restore the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Peavey and Hux oversaw the Battle of Crait from the command shuttle of Kylo Ren, the dark warrior who succeeded Snoke as the new Supreme Leader of the First Order. Although their forces decimated the Resistance and captured the base, the war for the galaxy would continue as a small group of survivors escaped from the battle aboard the Millennium Falcon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a veteran of the Galactic Empire, Edrison Peavey upheld the principles he gained through his service in the Imperial Navy and therefore regarded the chain of command with the utmost respect. Retaining his sense of professionalism as an officer of the First Order, Peavey typically maintained a rigid, unimpeachable posture while on duty. He also kept his personal opinions of General Armitage Hux a secret due to the latter's status as his commanding officer. Having watched Hux's rise to power through unscrupulous methods and nepotism, the Imperial veteran harbored contempt for the young general, whom he saw as an arrogant schemer with a poor grasp of tactics. Despite his dislike of Hux, Peavey was careful to keep his face expressionless while Commander Poe Dameron made a fool of the general."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Peavey believed Hux was capable of defeating the Resistance, he felt that it was only a matter of time until the general proved himself unfit to wield the authority that came with his rank. In Peavey's view, Hux was an incompetent officer and an intemperate leader\u2014a revolutionary, filled with fire and fervor, yet one whose glory was fleeting. While he also had a low opinion of Hux's late father, Brendol, whom he regarded as a madman, Peavey believed that the elder Hux had a better grasp of military etiquette than his son."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Whereas Peavey held little respect for Hux, he was impressed by Captain Yago, whose gunnery crews displayed excellent marksmanship during their assault on the Resistance transports. Not wanting resentment to fester in the Navy's upper echelon, he believed that the Supremacy's gunners deserved recognition for their skills and contribution to the destruction of the Resistance. He also gave little consideration to the Raddus after learning that its crew had abandoned ship. Even as the cruiser seemingly attempted to flee the battle, Peavey believed that the ship's captain was merely trying to lure the First Order away from the transports. He reacted with mild surprise when Hux ordered him to ignore the Resistance flagship, having secretly hoped that the general would not make a rash decision. However, Peavey was stricken with a horrified realization that the Raddus was about to perform an hyperspace ramming attack on the Supremacy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Peavey was a human male; by the time of his service in the First Order, he had graying blond hair, blue eyes, and light skin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Edrison Peavey was portrayed by Adrian Edmondson in the 2017 film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, the second installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
