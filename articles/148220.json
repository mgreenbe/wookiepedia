Having no shields, the U-boat mainly relied on its hull armor for protection, but a determined strafing run by aircraft could still destroy the U-boat in one pass. When an attack was detected, the U-boat usually attempted a crash dive, as laser or blaster bolts could not harm it underwater."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
