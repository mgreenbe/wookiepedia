Despite the fact that she had carried him through the academy, Tifino ended up excelling through the Imperial ranks faster than Wick after his unit discovered a cache of kyber crystals on the moon Jedha that earned him a place serving under Director Orson Callan Krennic of the Imperial Military Department of Advanced Weapons Research division. The pair attended an Empire Day Imperial Ball together where they met the HoloNet News reporter Calliope Drouth. Drouth bought the pair drinks and questioned them about their work, encouraging Wick to request scout work on Jedha from Krennic, and later introducing her to the director when she met him."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
