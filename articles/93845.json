The comlink was small enough that it could be mounted on a set of goggles or in a helmet. This was especially useful as the unit could beep or vibrate to notify the user of an incoming message. To avoid detection by the enemy, the link was set to transmit on a narrow wavelength."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
