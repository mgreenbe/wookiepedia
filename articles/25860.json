Chewbacca's first travels were to the remote and dangerous lower levels of Kashyyyk's immense forests, the Shadowlands. The Wookiee spent his first fifty years learning to participate in Wookiee society and gaining wisdom from his father. It was not long before his travels took him far from the confines of his green homeworld. In 150 BBY, at the age of fifty, Chewbacca left Kashyyyk to explore the galaxy in a rite of passage known as \"The Rising Path\". Chewbacca experienced a variety of adventures across different planets, eventually adopting a bandolier and a bowcaster as a deterrent to the many beings who often sought to test his strength.

However, Chewbacca's cousin Jowdrrl was friends with Malla and helped to slowly create a relationship between the two. Their blossoming relationship hit a snag when the Wookiee Tojjevvuk began to fight for Malla's affection. Chewbacca was eventually forced into an honor duel with Tojjevvuk for Malla's hand, but Tojjevvuk brought dishonor on the duel by using his claws, forbidden for a Wookiee.

Chewbacca staged a rescue from the Super Star Destroyer Pride of Yevetha with the help of his son and his cousins Jowdrrl, Shoran, and Dryanta.

They reached Drall after the Falcon's hyperdrive was damaged by a patrol ship. They went to Drall's planetary repulsor and were captured by their cousin Thrackan Sal-Solo.

While Chewbacca and Han began loading as many people as they could onto the Falcon, Anakin rushed off into Sernpidal City with the mayor in tow.

Chewbacca was able to bring Anakin to safety on the Falcon, but another blast of wind knocked him out of reach. Anakin piloted the Falcon, while his father stood on the entrance ramp hoping to lift Chewbacca up, but was forced to flee from Sernpidal when he realized it was too late to save Chewbacca. The Wookiee stood in the moon's trajectory, howling defiantly, and was crushed to death with those Sernpidalians who could not escape. His death drove Han to a resentment of his son Anakin.

Han even swore that Chewbacca spoke to him through the Force after he died, saving his life from Elan, a Yuuzhan Vong assassin. To commemorate his heroic efforts, the villagers of Kashyyyk built a memorial in his honor, which was personally carved by Tvrrdko into a large wroshyr tree. The memorial was visited by many well after his death. Han again visited the tree memorial of Chewbacca and stabbed Anakin Solo's lightsaber deep into the tree, so that anyone who would need it in the future could use it. To honor Chewbacca's life, C-3PO and R2-D2 decided to create a holo featuring the interviews of the people that knew him the most. A funeral also took place.

Even when the ship was in peak condition, he enjoyed attempting to upgrade and re-route the engines for greater efficiency and performance. Chewbacca has taken the Falcon's engines apart on several occasions and had a great understanding of the temperamental nature of its systems. He understood small craft such as the Sorosuub X-34 landspeeder and the Imperial AT-ST, and had intuitive ability to understand the workings of other vehicles, as situations arose.
