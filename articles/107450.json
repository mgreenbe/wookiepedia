Chiss individuals, nearly always females, who were born to be Force-sensitive, were born with the ability of precognition. Because of this, they were used by the Chiss to navigate and pilot their ships through the Unknown Regions, as well as finding and mapping temporary hyperlanes. Such Chiss navigators were known as ozyly-esehembo. Only Chiss children had precognitive power to safely guide their ships at the speed the Aristocras demanded, and as the Chiss grew older the ability faded, regardless of the amount of training or practice the individual undertook. Vah'nya was rare among the Chiss due to keeping her ability after childhood. She also had the ability of Second Sight. Un'hee was also capable of using precognition. The Force-sensitive child Eila could use this ability."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Precognition was first mentioned in Star Wars canon in the 2015 novel Aftermath, written by Chuck Wendig.
