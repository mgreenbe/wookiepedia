During the Galactic Civil War, and following a previous outbreak, an Rebel Alliance strike team attacked the base, and the virus was accidentally exposed throughout the facility in the ensuing battle. Johhar Kessen informed Saponza's partner about the leak. Communications were initially maintained, but an unexpected breach cut off any transmissions. As rebels engaged the Imperials in the facility, a rebel trooper later informed Kessen and Saponza's partner that the facility was being secured, just as the transmission was cut again by an Undead Trooper. Kessen informed the rebels that latest reports sighted a group of Undead Troopers heading towards the base. Although the zombies were repelled and destroyed, Kessen warned that the undead would return soon and in greater numbers, and that it would continue to do so until the infection had completely run its course."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
