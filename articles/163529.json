It was the sole place on the moon where water came to the surface; the water that emerged was warm and frothy, having passed through the moon's core. The A'Mar developed a particular custom relating to the wellspring over the ten generations they were present on the moon. This ritual, known as the Vigil, coincided with an eclipse of the sun caused by by of the planets in the star system, and it involved members of the A'Mar standing vigil over the wellspring during the night and drinking from its waters. The vigil could only be carried out by A'Mar that had never before drunk from the Wellspring."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
