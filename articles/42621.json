Baliss, who was actually a spy for the Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War, put himself in danger when he added the husband of Senator Verre Sydia to a list of potential Imperial sympathizers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sydia's husband was an Imperial operative as well, though he and Baliss were not aware of each other, and fearing his cover had been blown, the Senator's husband used classified Senate accounts to hire the bounty hunter Terrin Sandafar. In 3663 BBY, Sandafar placed explosives aboard Baliss' ship and detonated them when the noble was in orbit over his homeworld of Alderaan, killing Baliss instantly. The event was ruled an accident, but was later discovered to be Sandafar's work by the astromech droid T7-O1 and the Jedi Knight known as the Hero of Tython."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eckhorn Baliss and his ship are briefly mentioned in a series of conversations with the Jedi Knight companion character T7-O1 in BioWare's 2011 massively multiplayer online role-playing video game Star Wars: The Old Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
