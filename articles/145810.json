They were tall and fit, and had various amounts of coral growing out of their bodies to serve as natural weapons or defenses. Such coral outgrowths could include ridges to protect the eyes; spikes from the knuckles, elbows, and knees; limb and chest-plates; or even full-body stormtrooper-esque body armor. According to Kaye Galfridian, their feeling of pain is visible in their eyes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They sometimes walked with the use of their knuckles.
