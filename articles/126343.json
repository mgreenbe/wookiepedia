The Alanciari, Keshiri natives of the area, said that their continent resembled the leg of a local creature known as a muntok; the Six Claws corresponded to the beast's clawed foot. Two of the spits that made up the Six Claws were Point Defiance and Point Vigilance. The region was the continent's westernmost, bordering the Shank to the east."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
