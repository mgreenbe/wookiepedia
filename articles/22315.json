While aboard a Republic supply ship that was being transported back to Republic space by Jedi Commanders Ahsoka Tano and Barriss Offee, he heard the sound of blaster shots in the mess hall. He rushed in to investigate with the leader of Tango Company, Trap, only to be interrogated by Ahsoka and Barriss, the two having just survived an attack by two other clones, Ox and Edge. Once Havoc and Trap convinced the Jedi that they were not their enemies, the four attempted to contact the bridge via comlink but failed to receive any response. As a result, the Jedi left to inspect the bridge, instructing Havoc to stay behind to watch over the unconscious Ox and Edge."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Ahsoka and Barriss were away, Havoc fell prey to the Geonosian brain worms that had stowed aboard the ship and was subsequently mind-controlled, just as Ox and Edge had been. Later he along with the Scythe and Edge, pinned down the final uninfected clone trooper on the ship and infected him with a brain worm. Immediately afterwards, he and the rest of the clones were forced to attack the Jedi that had been watching the act. The Jedi escaped using the ventilation system, and in spite of capturing and infecting Barriss, Havoc along with the rest of the crew were finally sterilized when Ahsoka ruptured the ships cooling tanks kill the brain worms."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Havoc carried a DC-15A blaster rifle, and a DC-15S.
