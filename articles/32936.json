However the DLT-19 was much more powerful and had a much greater range than the E-11 model. The E-11s sniper rifle bore a striking resemblance to this weapon with the addition of a scope. In this configuration it could shoot down swoops, or even light airspeeders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was commonly carried by Imperial stormtroopers and army troopers although the bounty hunters 4-LOM and Dengar were also known to use the weapon. Imperial security details often used the rifle because of its long-range capabilities. It was these capabilities that made it a common sight on Imperial controlled planets with large, clear, open areas, like Tatooine. Sandtroopers in search of droids that were thought to carry the Death Star plans used these blaster rifles when they found the Millennium Falcon preparing to leave Tatooine. Chewbacca used a stolen one during the Rescue of Princess Leia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The DLT-19 was based on the real-world MG34 machine gun from Germany.
