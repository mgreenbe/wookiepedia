This, along with slight variances in the weapon's name throughout the series (in order: \"modified Bryar pistol,\" \"Bryar pistol,\" \"Bryar blaster pistol\"), has led to some ambiguity as to whether it was a new model in the Bryar line or the same gun used in the previous games."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
