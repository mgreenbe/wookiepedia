The 204th's TIE/ln space superiority starfighters took out the convoy's escorts within minutes, before damaging and disabling the cargo vessels, which included the freighter Diamond Tor. The 204th then left."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The rescue"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, as part of the ongoing hunt for the 204th Imperial Fighter Wing, General Hera Syndulla and her New Republic forces aboard the Star Destroyer Deliverance, arrived in Midgor on a heavy reconnaissance mission, following intelligance transmitted to the Deliverance by one of the Alphabet Squadron pilots, Captain Nath Tensent. After arrival, the Deliverance held back in case of a trap, while its starfighter wing moved ahead. One of the Wild Squadron pilots, Vitale (Wild Two), picked up something on his sensors. The wing's commander, Wyl Lark went ahead with Flare Squadron to take a better look, while Hail and Wild Squadrons held position. Flare pilot, Ghordansk, spotted one and recognized it as an Imperial cargo hauler. Lark carried out a fly-by and tried to raise comms with the convoy. Captain Oultovar Misk of the disabled freighter Diamond Tor responded, by requesting assistance and offering their surrender. Misk explained that they were attacked by TIE fighters, who took out their escorts in minutes, then moved on. Lark promised to help, then transmitted an all-clear to the Deliverance and ordered his squadrons to assist with evacuation and damage control."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
