A power capacitor initiated a reaction in the blower, and the energy from the reaction was recycled by back-blast impellers into the hoverscout's air cushion in an efficient use of power generation that gave the vehicle a longer range than other hover vehicles of comparable size and type."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
