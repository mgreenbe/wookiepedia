Jabba later revealed they were the last of their kind. Mux had complete control over them, using K4 security droids to monitor their actions. When Solo and Chewbacca arrived, they discovered Mux was cheating Jabba. They hatched a plan to rob Mux of his stored gems and his laborers. Chewbacca loaded them onto Mux's ship while Solo distracted the Arcona miner. Chewbacca lifted off, and Solo blasted Mux's droid before escaping in the Millennium Falcon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two ships met in orbit.
