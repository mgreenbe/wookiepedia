They were a peaceful people, known by many as artists and architects. When life on Kiva was wiped out by an experiment, they remained as disembodied wraiths. They appeared as shadows with red eyes. They believed that Mammon Hoole, one of the scientists involved in the experiment, was responsible for their fate and tried to kill him when he arrived on the planet many years later. They later learned that Borborygmus Gog, Hoole's fellow scientist and the mastermind of Project Starscream, was truly to blame. They all converged upon him, and the Kivan wraiths, along with Gog vanished without a trace. They also seemed vulnerable to ion weapons."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
