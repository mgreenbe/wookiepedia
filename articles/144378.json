Maul continues, telling Ahsoka that he was certain Obi-Wan Kenobi would have been the one to search for him, perhaps with his \"loyal foal,\" Anakin Skywalker, but Ahsoka states that Kenobi had a more important engagement, leading Maul to wonder if \"the moment\" is upon them. Maul ponders why Kenobi sent Ahsoka, and she suggests he surrender so they can ask him.

Ahsoka tells them that Maul mentioned a name: Darth Sidious. Bo-Katan inquires as to who that is. Agreeing to reveal the suspicions of the Jedi Council, Kenobi explains that Darth Sidious is the Sith Lord who orchestrated the Clone Wars and has manipulated both sides from the beginning. He says that he first learned the name from Count Dooku, but that the chance of learning any more from Dooku has been lost, as Anakin executed him while rescuing the Chancellor.

Kenobi, after asking to speak with Ahsoka alone, tells her that he is currently unavailable as the Council has tasked him with closely observing the Chancellor and his movements, and reporting back with what he learns due to the Senate allowing him to remain in office far longer than the duration of his term expired, with the Council hoping to learn his true intentions. Ahsoka perceives that they have tasked him with spying on the Chancellor, a close friend and mentor to Anakin, instead of observing, and believes he will not be enthused with his assignment. Kenobi agrees, saying that it would be best if Ahsoka spoke to him, although Ahsoka believes she is not the right person to do that. Kenobi states that the Council isn't always correct in their actions, and is why he seeks her help. Before they can say any more, Rex rushes in, saying there has been another attack.
