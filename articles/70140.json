He created lightsabers with casings of crystal, wood, and stone, and one unique lightsaber crafted as a liquid matrix suspended in a compressed gravity tube. Jedi Master Mace Windu was given one of Baaks' lightsabers, although he later gave this to a young Jedi from the Cularin system. Baaks himself traveled to the Cularin system, where he trained five new Jedi artisans. Another artisan, Jedi Jwartek, crafted a hilt out of a branch from an ancient tree, while another specialized in crystal and glass hilts."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
