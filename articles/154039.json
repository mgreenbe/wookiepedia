The species developed an advanced culture and constructed an extensive network of structures on the surface of Neona. Circa 19,997 BBY,[source?] Neona underwent a sustained warming period: polar ice caps melted, raising the level of Neona's oceans until all the planet's landmasses were covered except for a frozen continent at each pole. The flooding of their cities led to the extinction of the species."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Twenty-thousand years later, the ruins of their civilization still dotted Neona's ocean bed. By this time, Neona had become a mining world under the control of Hanson Mining Consolidated. While under Hanson Mining's administration, teams of archeologists and xenoanthrolopogists occasionally explored these ruins. The Mrlsst Academy even dispatched a team of scientists to examine the ruins in a systematic study. They established a small research station underwater at the edge of a large ruin in the southern hemisphere of Neona."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Paul Sudlow and Chris Doyle created this species for Lords of the Expanse, a 1997 West End Games boxed set supplement to Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
