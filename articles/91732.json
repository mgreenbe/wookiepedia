Meanwhile, the two infiltrated the temple and, following the ventilation system, gained access to the holocron storage room. Parasitti knocked the librarian Jocasta Nu unconscious and assume her identity, but it was by the Padawan Ahsoka Tano. After a brief duel, Tano managed to capture Parasitti. Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker followed Bane and the techno-service droid, but were fooled by Bane, who ordered Todo 360 to split and to head for the communications center, leading the Jedi away from the true target. The bounty hunter successfully managed to steal the holocron he was looking for and escaped the Jedi Temple, while detonating a bomb hidden inside Todo 360 served as a distraction maneuver."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
