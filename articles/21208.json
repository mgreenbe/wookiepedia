They lived in crevasses where they were hunted with spears by the colonists of Eol Sha. The hunters then steamed the crustaceans and cracked open their shells to eat the sour-tasting pink meat found inside. On the day Luke Skywalker arrived on Eol Sha, as part of his search for Force-sensitives to join his Jedi Praxeum, a landslide trapped two young colonists out hunting the crustaceans. The young boy was killed while the young girl survived. Skywalker was later given some bugdillos to eat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The creatures may have gone extinct due to the Cauldron Nebula being destroyed by Kyp Durron using the Sun Crusher."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
