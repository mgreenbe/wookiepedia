With the Force power of hyper-tunneling, which was similar to traveling through hyperspace, loth-wolves were able to transport people from the caves of the wolf den in the Lothal's northern hemisphere to the caves of the cliff dwelling after the theft of the TIE Defender Elite. It was used by loth-wolves to transport Ezra Bridger and his companions, with one wolf even grabbing the astromech droid Chopper in its mouth, to transport them across Lothal to the Lothal Jedi Temple."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
