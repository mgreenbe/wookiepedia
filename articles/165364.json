They were heavily armed with four laser cannons on the S-foils and proton torpedo launchers in the fuselage. X-wings were designed for dogfighting and long missions. During the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel Alliance used T-65B X-wing starfighters and T-65C-A2 X-wings in many battles, including the Battle of Yavin and the Battle of Endor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Approximately thirty years later, a different and upgraded variation of X-wing, the T-70, was used by the Resistance, whereas a more advanced model, the T-85, was used by the New Republic Defense Fleet."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Design and development"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The X-wing was descended from Incom Corporation's Clone Wars\u2013era starfighters, namely the Aggressive ReConnaissance-170 starfighter, Clone Z-95 Headhunter, and Z-95 Headhunter. Incom's engineers strove to build a well-rounded, hyperdrive-equipped snubfighter with no exploitable weakness. The new starfighter was intended to become the backbone of the Imperial Navy, but political forces led to the Galactic Empire deciding to rely on Sienar Fleet Systems' more affordable TIE line. The Alliance to Restore the Republic then adopted the X-wing design as its own."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 5 ABY, Incom-FreiTek Corporation introduced the T-70 model, which incorporated many improvements over the T-65 series. The Incom engineers, having learned a valuable lesson from the loss of so many X-wings in the trenches at Battle of Yavin, equipped the T-70 with a swiveling blaster cannon that could be used to fend off attacks from behind. At least one prototype had been constructed prior to the Battle of Jakku. By 34 ABY, the New Republic had retired most of its T-70s in favor of the T-85s, which were even more capable than the already impressive T-70s."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Operational history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Alliance to Restore the Republic operated T-65B X-wings as early as 1 BBY. During the attack on Lothal at least 10 T-65B X-wing starfighters alongside BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bombers participated in the assault, but all were destroyed by the Imperial defenses. Hera Syndulla, Mart Mattin, Secon Daree, C1-10P, and R3-A3 survived being shot down, but many other pilots were killed and their astromechs destroyed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Alliance had at least three squadrons equipped with the T-65 series by 0 BBY.

X-wings saw action shortly before the outbreak of the Galactic Civil War in both the Liberation of Erso and the Mission to Eadu."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The full-scale Galactic Civil War began with the Battle of Scarif, a costly but significant victory for the Alliance. The newly assembled squad, Rogue One, a special forces team created by Jyn Erso, Cassian Andor, Baze Malbus, Chirrut \u00cemwe, Bodhi Rook, and K-2SO disobeyed direct orders from Alliance High Command and instead deployed itself to Scarif in a desperate bid to steal the technical readouts for the Empire's Death Star battle station, and was subsequently joined by the Alliance Fleet. X-wings from Red Squadron, Green Squadron, Blue Squadron, and Gold Squadron engaged Imperial TIEs and attempted to destroy the Shield Gate, while the capital ships joined the Shield Gate assault and fought the Imperial Star Destroyers. Shortly after the Alliance acquired the Death Star plans, the Death Star arrived at Scarif and fired a low-power blast at the Citadel Tower, killing all forces at the Imperial surface installation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Within days of Scarif, the Empire learned that the Alliance was headquartered at Yavin 4, and deployed the Death Star to crush the Alliance. The Alliance, having learned of the battle station's fatal design flaw, deployed a force of 30 starfighters (including 22 X-wings) to attempt a series of attack runs on the planet-killing space station. The result was another costly victory for the Alliance. Luke Skywalker, a Force-sensitive Rebel pilot, fired a pair of proton torpedoes into the Death Star's thermal exhaust port, causing a chain reaction in the reactor that destroyed the entire station. Although the Death Star was gone, the Alliance lost 27 starfighters (including 20 X-wings) in the assault."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime during 0 ABY, three X-wings of Red Squadron were deployed in a mission to Giju, which resulted in the rescue of multiple Alliance agents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A few days of the Battle of Yavin, Leia Organa and Evaan Verlaine disobeyed orders from Alliance High Command and departed on mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan.

The Alliance used the Harbinger to break through the Siege on Tureen VII and bring relief supplies to the planet's population. Although the hijacking ended with an Alliance victory, it resulted in C-3PO's capture by Task Force 99.

The rearguard actions on the surface covering the evacuation proved costly to the Alliance, with many personnel killed. Additionally, the Alliance was forced to leave behind much of their heavy equipment, and the fleet scattered throughout the Outer Rim Territories. Most X-wings joined the Alliance fleet at a predetermined rendezvous point."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke Skywalker, however, traveled to the Dagobah system to seek out Yoda, the former Grand Master of the Jedi Order. Due to Dagobah's thick fog, Skywalker crashed his X-wing in a swamp. Some time later, the starfighter sank further until it was almost fully submerged, at which point Skywalker attempted to recover it. While he had developed some skill with telekinesis, his self-doubt led to his ultimate inability to lift his waterlogged X-wing from the bog, and only with Yoda's assistance was the starfighter moved to solid ground. When Skywalker left the system, he traveled to Bespin, where he ended up abandoning his X-wing when circumstances compelled him to depart in the Millennium Falcon."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, X-wings assisted Twilight Company in Operation Ringbreaker, an attempt to divert Imperial forces from Kuat to make the planet more vulnerable to attack. The operation saw numerous engagements with X-wings in combat, including an attack on the dockyards of Najan-Rovi. The campaign scored some notable successes, but it ultimately ended with the Siege of Inyusu Tor and the failure to reach Kuat.

Upon the successful completion of the rescue, Skywalker returned to Dagobah, fulfilling a promise to Yoda. After Yoda's death, Skywalker departed Dagobah for the final time, en route to Sullust to rejoin the Alliance fleet. On Skywalker's arrival, the entirety of the Alliance Fleet staged a large-scale assault on the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station, an under-construction Imperial battle station with even more firepower than the original Death Star.

X-wings accompanied the A/SF-01 B-wing starfighters of Blade Squadron in the Battle for Kuat Drive Yards, which crippled the Empire's capability to produce starships and walkers.
