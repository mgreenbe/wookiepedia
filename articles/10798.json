In the lead-up to the Battle of Jakku, Auxi continued serving Chancellor Mothma and urged her to find a second advisor.

She frequently argued with her fellow advisor Hostis Ij. Following the Battle of Naalol, Auxi toured the planet Naalol with Chancellor Mon Mothma and Hostis Ij. While the Chancellor and Hostis were discussing the merits of war, Auxi reminded Mothma that they had to return to the New Republic capital Chandrila for the reconstituted Galactic Senate's opening ceremony."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While walking, Auxi told Hostis that they were going to proceed with their plan to relinquish the Chancellor's emergency powers; a prerogative that had been derived from the former office of Supreme Chancellor. However, Hostis countered that it was not the right time due to the Galactic Civil War. Chancellor Mothma agreed with Auxi and announced her plan to relinquish the Chancellor's emergency powers in the near future since they had been used by the late Palpatine to seize power during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Hostis expressed dismay at the Chancellor's plans to demilitarize the New Republic Defense Force, Mothma informed her advisors that she would submit a vote at the Galactic Senate to reduce the New Republic's military presence by 90% once they were able to officially confirm an end to the Galactic Civil War. When Hostis warned that demilitarizing the New Republic would not bring peace to the galaxy, Auxi remarked that he would fit in well with the Empire. Before the two could argue, Chancellor Mothma intervened and reiterated that she would relinquish her emergency powers and submit a vote on the demilitarization of the New Republic.

After Chancellor Mothma indicated that she was feeling tired and distracted, Auxi stressed that the Chancellor had made herself clear and ordered an end to the meeting. She also instructed the senators to reconvene on Nakadia, the newly-designated capital of the New Republic.

Auxi added that Mothma had also managed to keep the New Republic military strong without making it look like she was trying to impose her will on the galaxy. When Auxi mentioned the liberation of Kashyyyk, Mothma explained that the situation was complicated because the Senate had opposed intervention but that her friend Princess Leia Organa had gotten involved.

However, Mothma and her allies incurred the wrath of her political opponent Senator Wartol, who had coerced the five senators into initially voting against Mothma's bill in the Senate.
