The Vigilance was given overall command of the small Cularin Armed Forces flotilla Task Group Destruction that was assembled for the venture and accompanied the formation to a featureless star system in which the abandoned facility was situated. Upon arrival in the system, Suubrin's forces scanned the base and reported to the captain that the installation was deserted, with no life signs or significant droid activity detected. Based on these readings, Suubrin suspected that the investigation of the base would likely fail to yield any useful strategic information."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite having misgivings about the prospects of success, Suubrin gave orders for ground forces, consisting of a unit of clone marines, four engineers and the heroes of Cularin, a team of independent specialist agents, to be transported to the abandoned base. The captain commanded that the engineers and half of the marines were to bring the facility's power back on line while the specialist agents and the remaining marines were to proceed to the installation's command center and recover any available data. Suubrin personally appraised the troops of the mission plan and advised that they take care to avoid any traps or mines left behind by the Separatists. The specialist agents subsequently recollected their briefing with the captain while being shuttled to the Separatist facility."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Suubrin's forces raided the base, the Vigilance detected the nearby presence of a starfighter piloted by the Cerean Jedi Master Ki-Adi-Mundi. The Jedi was wounded from an encounter with the Dark Jedi Garth Ezzar and after receiving medical treatment aboard the Vigilance, Mundi met with Suubrin on the vessel's bridge, inside the captain's briefing room. When the heroes of Cularin returned to the Vigilance from the Separatist base, Suubrin informed them of the Jedi Master's arrival and introduced the agents to the Cerean."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Suubrin featured in Destruction, a 2005 roleplaying adventure by Ronald A.
