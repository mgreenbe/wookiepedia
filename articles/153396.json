When the Rebel Alliance's 61st Mobile Infantry held a recruitment drive on the terrestrial astronomical object Demiloch sometime prior to the year 3 ABY, the Imperial spy posed as a recruit. The spy then shot the company's captain, Micha Evon, prompting his second-in-command, Lieutenant Sairgon, to cut the recruitment drive short. Evon was unconscious for two days, but eventually recovered. In 3 ABY, the rebel soldier and ex-bounty hunter Brand brought up the incident on Demiloch in a conversation about Evon during his funeral."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Imperial spy was mentioned in the 2015 novel Battlefront: Twilight Company, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
