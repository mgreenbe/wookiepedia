Tyrrahl trained the students on Monfreen, a planet where he himself had earlier been trained as a Jedi. It was on this planet where Tyrrahl encountered the Citadel of Shadows, a dark side nexus. Years later, while instructing Lian Dray, Tyrrhal allowed Dray to enter the Citadel, as Dray claimed to be ready for the next challenge in his training. Dray proved to be wrong, however, and fell to the dark side."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tyrrahl was known for using many proverbs and saying in his training, a habit that greatly annoyed Dray."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ven-Mah Tyrrahl was created by author Paul Danner and appeared in the short story titled Light and Shadow, which was set during the time of the Great Sith War.
