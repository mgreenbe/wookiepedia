It was a powerful sedative that could put even the largest organisms into a deep sleep. Gonster of the Twin Hills was known to possess a batch of this potion, kept alongside its other ingredients. The Ewoks Wicket Wystri Warrick and Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka obtained a vial of Dream flower potion for use on the Raich during his temporary return.
