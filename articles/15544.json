Non-sentient, bearsloths moved on six limbs through the forest canopy; their dark red and brown fur allowed them to blend in with the deep red leaves of Arbooine's forests. Six sharp horns protruded from the sides of their face, while two sets of two eyes allowed for the bearsloth to better track its prey. Ambush predators, bearsloths used their sheer strength and deadly venom to subdue their prey. They nest in hollows within the great trees, and carry their prey back to these nest to consume later. Some Sathari hunters use the venom from slain bearsloths to poison the blades of their diiros."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
