In action it was more of a disease, taking up residence in the victim's body and setting off chemical reactions that rapidly diminished the victim's ability to resist the pull of the dark side of the Force. The poison could be fatal unless counteracted by strong Jedi powers, and even then its effects were likely to remain."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sith poison could either be ingested or administered by medical means, usually via syringe; both of these methods brought a much shorter reaction time upon the victim.

Qel-Droma suffered the full effects of the poison instantly, and involuntarily released the dark side with such force that he destroyed the Krath torture device he was harnessed to. Qel-Droma suffered from outbursts from then on, up until it drove him into murdering his own brother, Cay Qel-Droma. The sudden shock of Cay's death broke the dark side's thrall over Ulic, and of the poison's torment as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, the Dark Jedi Thaum Rystra used Sith sorcery to fix stingers to the lekku of the Twi'lek Desvin Tor'thal, that could fire Sith poison."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sith poison was first introduced in the Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi - Dark Lords of the Sith story arc, and was one plot device among many used to develop the story of Ulic Qel-Droma's progression down the dark side.
