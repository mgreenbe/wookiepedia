During the Imperial Era, Quelton Fabrication supplied stormtrooper armor to the Imperial Military. Quelton disagreed with the Galactic Empire's militarism and feared that the Empire would use her products to wage aggressive wars. She colluded with the Ithorian owner of Cladtech to delay the production of stormtrooper armor. In addition, Quelton fitted the helmet's ventilation systems with Bottleneck spores, which were deadly to human lungs. After her conspiracy was exposed by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and the Imperial efficiency expert Count Denetrius Vidian, Quelton committed suicide to avoid capture. The Empire then merged Quelton with Cladtech and brought them under the control of the Imperial Department of Military Research."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
