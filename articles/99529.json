Odis sized up Surik, saying she looked like a spacer and asked if she needed a crew. He further explained that he flew during the Mandalorian Wars and the Jedi Civil War and was hoping Surik would hire him on as crew for her ship. When Surik asked why he was no longer flying, Odis responded that he needed a pilot's license to fly freighters on Nar Shaddaa and that they were difficult to obtain without a sponsor. Surik offered to refer to Odis anyone she encountered who was looking for a pilot. She was eventually able to convince the crew of the starship Lunar Shadow, who were sick of waiting for their unreliable captain to return from the Jekk'Jekk Tarr, a cantina on the Nar Shaddaa Docks, to hire Odis as their new captain and pilot."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A veteran pilot of the Mandalorian Wars and the Jedi Civil War, Odis was upset that, even after his service to the Republic, he was left as a refugee on Nar Shaddaa. Odis was proud of his service, though, and he did not care what anyone thought about it or himself. He was greatly appreciative of anyone willing to help him.

However, the player is not required to interact with Odis or find him a job to progress the main plot of the game. The game offers an alternative option to find Odis employment by convincing Fassa, the dock manager for Vogga the Hutt, to hire Odis. The Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide lists this as the only outcome for Odis's quest, but since it does not result in light side points like the Lunar Shadow outcome, this article does not consider this the canon result."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
