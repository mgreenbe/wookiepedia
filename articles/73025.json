One prong held the bridge, and the other two, extending below, may have served a purpose in cargo handling. Its only obvious armament was two pairs of laser cannons, mounted at the ends of the lower projections. It was used to escort Sentinel droids into battle or occupation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Originally designed by Kellenech Technologies, a droid manufacturer, this ship was supposed to carry its military and construction droids. But when it bankrupted, the Galactic Republic took the design and began production of the ships through Republic Fleet Systems. However, after the Great Sith War the funding stopped and a variety of manufacturers was contracted to finish the vessels for military and commercial use."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The freighter was used by the Galactic Republic, as well as the Sith enemies, not to mention the civilian use . One of its most memorable uses was at the battle of Dxun during the Mandalorian Wars, when many of these freighters were used to drop Sentinel battle droids onto the moon to combat the Mandalorian invaders. They were also used to shuttle kolto from Manaan and to deliver supplies to the Sith embassy on Taris. Ironically enough, the Zhug brothers would crash their own KT-400 on Dxun years later when attempting to collect a bounty on the Jedi Exile."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The freighter was very popular with mercenaries and bounty hunters for its large cargo hold and armament."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
