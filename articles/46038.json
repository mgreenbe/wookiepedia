It was occupied by the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and the Sith Eternal by 35 ABY. It was also the birthplace of Supreme Leader Snoke, whom Sidious created to rule the First Order while concealing himself in the shadows. Exegol was used to hide the Final Order, which was a fleet amassed by Sidious and the Sith Eternal, from where they planned to deploy their Star Destroyers and establish a new Sith Empire. Exegol was the site of a battle during the war between the First Order and the Resistance, which saw the defeat of the Sith loyalists."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Exegol was a dark, barren, and rocky planet with desert flats. Its dry conditions, combined with the rubbing of dust particles in its atmosphere, created enormous static discharges that appeared as lightning strikes from the planet surface. The desolate world was covered with enormous fissures that reached deep into its crust. These were excavated by Sith loyalists who were attempting to reach a transportative vergence they believed to lie beneath the surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Exegol's nearby space was littered with the remains of megafauna, resulting in the formation of a cloud of red gas and stardust forming around the world, which posed a navigation barrier."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As mentioned by the Jedi writer Kli the Elder in the Rammahgon, Exegol (or Ixigul, as Kli wrote it) once had a fertile environment, until the Sith established their presence there and laid waste to the planet just as they did with Korriban, Ziost, and Asog. Among the changes the Sith made was the creation of massive underground shipyard forges. Exegol was one of the oldest Sith bastions. Under the Sith, the Sith Citadel was built on Exegol for meetings and rituals to be conducted within, and Sith loyalists excavated the world's large and deep planetary fissures in hopes of reaching a transportive vergence believed to lie beneath the planet surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to legend, two Sith Lords, Darth Noctyss and Darth Sanguis, reached Exegol in their quest for immortality, which the former hoped to learn from the latter. Unknown to Noctyss, Sanguis had achieved immortality by transforming himself into a horrendous creature. Tricking Noctyss by not revealing himself as Darth Sanguis, Sanguis managed to be killed by Noctyss in a ritual to acquire immortality, leading Noctyss to conclude too late that Sanguis had tricked her into becoming a creature like him and freeing him from his miserable existence."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Imperial Era"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to its remote location and inherent veil of secrecy, the Sith Eternal cult chose Exegol as its base; a planet unknown to even the most studious of galactic historians, some of whom knew about Korriban/Moraband and the other Sith worlds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the era of the Galactic Empire, Sidious had intended for Exegol to become his permanent seat of power. He would ready the ancient throne of the Sith. Seeking ways of unlocking the secrets of immortality, his underlings began to experiment with cloning technology in a bid to extend his lifespan. Sidious also proceeded to modernize the ancient shipyards, including making them highly automated, so the construction of a fleet of Xyston-class Star Destroyers was underway by the time of the Galactic Civil War. Sidious' and his Sith cultists' genetic machinations led to the creation of several artificial constructs, including potential replacements for his Sith apprentice, Darth Vader. He also stored several other frail specimens within vats and kept them existing in a state of pain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These schemes were kept hidden from Vader until shortly after his duel on Cloud City, when he encountered the Eye of Webbish Bog on Mustafar, who gifted him with a Sith wayfinder that led to Exegol. Seeking answers, Vader forced the Sith assassin Ochi of Bestoon to accompany him on his journey, and together they passed through the Red Honeycomb Zone, eventually crash-landing on the planet's surface. Vader fought through Sidious's defenses and spotted the severed hand of his son, Luke Skywalker, in the cloning center. Eventually, Vader and Ochi found themselves faced with a massive kyber crystal being tormented to corrupt it to the dark side. The power of the crystal was too much for Ochi, whose eyes were burnt by its power, but Vader pressed on, intent to finally have revenge on Sidious. Nevertheless, the Sith Master taunted Vader, telling him of his power and how he could only share it if he again accepted his position as apprentice. Although Vader received a vision of his son telling him he was destined to kill Sidious, Vader agreed to rejoin his master."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Return of Sidious"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Sidious' death at the Battle of Endor, the Sith loyalists continued to construct the Final Order, a massive fleet of warships.

Below the surface there was a large hall with massive ancient statues carved in the likenesses of ancient Sith Lords. There was also an ampitheater that housed the Throne of the Sith.
