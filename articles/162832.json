It was marketed as a gladiator droid despite its manufacturers knowing it would be used for security. Created during the Old Sith Wars, in 4015 BBY, these droids were a revolution in security. Their fingers were gun barrels and their chest plates would open up to reveal some of the most powerful laser cannons to be mounted on, or in, a Human sized droid. \"Red Terror\" units were used as the only form of security on Telti, a major droid manufacturing moon. They were known to resist memory wipes and could be quite ruthless with their security duties."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
