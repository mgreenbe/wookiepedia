When the fallen Jedi Xanatos returned to his homeworld sometime before 44 BBY, he brought with him the mining resources of the Offworld Mining Corporation, and while hiding his motives behind a guise of games and politics, proceeded to mine and destroy many of Telos's most sacred sites, including the Sacred Pools. Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, with the help of the con-man Den and POWER party member Andra, put a stop to Xanatos' abuse of the sites, but not before the once-pristine Sacred Pools had become heavily polluted by the mining effort. The pools at the time of Xanatos' last stand were bubbling, blackish and highly toxic, capable of stripping flesh from the bone in seconds. They constantly seeped yellowish, toxic vapors. The area surrounding the pools was actively volcanic, and characterized by areas of hardened lava and fissures which erupted periodically with large bursts of steam."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During his final duel with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, Xanatos used the steam bursts to good effect in keeping the two Jedi at bay. When reinforcements arrived in support of his former master, however, Xanatos became cornered by one of the pools. Rather than be taken alive or killed by his former master, Xanatos threw himself into the pool behind him, dissolving away in seconds. Following the incident, the Telosian government resolved to clean up the harm done by Offworld to the sacred sites."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
