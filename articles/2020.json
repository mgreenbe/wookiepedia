The speeder was released some decades before the Battle of Yavin. The speeder's unusual design was aimed at Ugor customers: it had a spherical shape with viewports around its hull. The vehicle ascended and hovered above its intended occupants, who then oozed underneath and up into the speeder to board. Nevertheless, sales of the unit flopped. Ubrikkian revised the design to appeal to humanoid clientele by adding seats. The new design was released as the 9000 Z001 landspeeder."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
