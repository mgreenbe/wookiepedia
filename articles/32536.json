The black spherical main section of the space station hung from the \"bottom\" of the asteroid, with pipes extending into the asteroid and securing the station to its surface, and a tower extended from the bottom of the main section down away from the asteroid. The facility also continued through the interior of the asteroid all the way to its other side, where several communications antennas and towers were built. The facility had at least one hangar bay, and during its era of productivity, it processed ore from the surrounding asteroids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Czerka Corporation established the mining facility sometime before the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire in order to harvest ore from the asteroid field. The facility hosted a thriving ore-processing industry, but as the station's profits began to decline, Czerka ultimately withdrew its funding, and the facility was abandoned by the year 3643 BBY. That year, the Sith Emperor sought to retrieve Kira Carsen, a former Child of the Emperor\u2014individuals who were unknowingly agents of the Emperor\u2014so he sent the Child Valis to capture her. As Carsen and her current Jedi mentor were working to stop the Sith Lord Darth Angral's efforts to destroy the Republic, Valis posed as Angral's loyal subordinate Admiral Hacklin of the Imperial Navy and contacted the Republic's General Var Suthra with an offer to defect."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Having spread rumors that the admiral had earned a death mark, \"Hacklin\" refused to surrender to anyone other than Carsen, whom the real Hacklin had met earlier at the planet Ord Mantell, so Suthra arranged a meeting at the abandoned mining facility. Carsen and the Jedi Knight to whom she was apprenticed arrived after Valis to find the station's hangar empty except for one ship with a single light above the boarding ramp, and as the two Jedi approached the ship, Valis emerged from behind some of the cargo crates scattered around the hangar. The Sith introduced himself and explained the Emperor's intentions, but when the Knight refused to comply, the meeting turned hostile. In the duel that followed, the two Jedi overcame Valis and killed him, leaving the Sith's body and ship in the facility as they returned to the Republic and notified both General Suthra and the Jedi High Council of what had happened."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The mining facility first appeared in the Jedi Knight-class mission \"The Defector\" in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a video game released by BioWare and LucasArts in 2011.
