Amidala's corpse, in spite of Naboo custom requiring cremation of the deceased, was contained within a rectangular sarcophagus decorated with the stylized emblem of Naboo, and a soft-colored stained-glass window showed the image of the deceased. On either side of the sarcophagus, a stone pot filled with red flowers stood on a column. At some point after his transformation into the armored Darth Vader, Amidala's husband, the fallen Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker came to visit the mausoleum, stricken by grief and remorse for his part in her death."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Padm\u00e9 Amidala's mausoleum was first pictured on one of the trading cards from the 2012 Topps Star Wars Galaxy Series 7 set released by Topps in February 2012.
