This seemed to disrupt the balance between the planet's gravity and centrifugal force, and Morjakar was sent spiraling off into deep space. It eventually entered the Cularin system (although it did not become a part of it), and was caught in the massive gravity well of the system's binary stars. It settled into an eccentric orbit at an odd angle from the rest of the system's planets, and was sometimes missed by scouts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was not known to have been inhabited, although no proper research had been made on it as of 31 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
