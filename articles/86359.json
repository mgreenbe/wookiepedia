He had an anti-Imperial bias. He thrice traveled to Endor and twice sojourned amongst the Gupins, having close encounters with dangerous Grass Trekkers; in one of his trips, in 12 ABY, he was part of a group of biologists sent to study the indigenous and introduced lifeforms of the moon, and took a concussion rifle to fend off the Grass Trekkers. He was particularly interested in Gupin shapeshifting and in the local magic, especially that of the Snow King, Sun King, Flower Queen, and Leaf Queen."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
