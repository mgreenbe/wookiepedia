Meanwhile, outside the Hive Palace, two stormtroopers stand guard against any trouble. Clat the Shamer appears from the night startling the two troopers. Before either of the troopers can fire at the mysterious shape, Clat uses his powers as an empath to drive them both insane with the guilt of their past deeds."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After dealing with the troopers, Clat moves into the palace, interrupting the game of Firepath to confront Vader.
