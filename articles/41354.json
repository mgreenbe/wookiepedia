In 2 BBY, he was sent to an underground mining colony on an airless moon in the Outer Rim Territories. While there, he was alerted by a miner, Corbin, who had joined the Empire, that a married couple, Ryland and Fiona, were rebel spies. This was not true, as Corbin was framing them out of jealousy. Duggan arrested Ryland and Fiona, and ordered them to confess. When they refused, as they were completely innocent, Duggan had Fiona executed. Ryland and his daughter, Laina, eventually escaped to the Rebel Alliance with the help of relatives."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
