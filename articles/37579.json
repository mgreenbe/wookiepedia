It was led by a Chief of Detectives and based out of the Coruscant Security Force Headquarters in Galactic City on the planet Coruscant. The detective division was charged with investigating major crimes including homicides and kidnappings which were beyond the capabilities of the police officers and police droids who worked patrol. Notable cases included the massacre at the headquarters of the Order of the Canted Circle in the Fobosi District, the murder of Senator Pax Teem of Malaster and the burning of the Malastare embassy, the kidnapping of Chi Eekway and Che Amanwe, the daughters of the Pantoran Chairman Notluwiski Papanoida, the murder of Senator Onaconda Farr of Rodia, the murder of Jedi Master Tresina Lobi, and the murders of the Bothan ambassador and several other Bothans."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Organization"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The detective division was the investigative arm of the Coruscant Security Force (CSF). They were responsible for investigating crimes such as homicides, difficult-to-solve cases, explosions, and other incidents requiring special investigations. The division was led by a Chief of Detectives who handed out assignments and set case priorities. Police officers who held ranks higher than detective, such as lieutenant, also would conduct investigations and were referred to as inspectors."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Mass murders and Sith"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 52 BBY, CSF detectives were summoned by two Jedi Knights to investigate a grisly crime scene at the headquarters of the Order of the Canted Circle in the Fobosi District. Upon their arrival they discovered dozens and dozens of dead including two Echani warriors believed to be bodyguards, twelve Muuns of the InterGalactic Banking Clan, and triple that number of Maladian assassins dressed in the Canted Circle Order's robes who had been killed by blaster fire and traumatic amputations. The Order's members whose robes had been borrowed, were bound and unconscious and lay in various locations. The amputated remains of the Maladians were so scattered that the CSF detectives initially surmised an explosive had detonated though no explosive evidence could be found. The Jedi who had notified the police, did not reveal why they had been at the location and why they had an interest in the the case."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A second major crime scene at the Malastare embassy also had the CSF detectives engaged. There, Senator Pax Teem of Malaster along with several guest had been killed and the embassy completely burned. The CSF was able to determine that due to numerous amount of blood discovered at the scene of the fire, the victims had been killed first before the setting of the fire. This led the police detectives to believe that the mass killings and fire were a hit orchestrated by organized crime. Unknown to the CSF, the scene at the Chanted Circle headquarters was the result of Senator Teem hiring the Maladian assassins to kill Hego Damask, the alter ego of Darth Plagueis. The assassination had been interrupted by Palpatine and Sate Pestage who together with Plagueis had killed the Maladians. Palpatine, filled with rage, had gone after Senator Teem, invading the residence and massacring the security guards and the dinner guests before setting Teem on fire along with the rest of the building. The sudden activity of the dark side of the Force had alerted the Jedi who sent two members of the Jedi Council to scene. However, the Jedi, as before, refused to clarify their presence and interest in the case. With the Jedi, the Order of the Canted Circe, InterGalactic Banking Clan, and the Gran Protectorate remaining silent, the case stalled despite attempts by the Senate Investigative Committee to continue the investigation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 32 BBY, the CSF came into conflict with the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Maul when he was pursuing a group through the Crimson Corridor that included Jedi Padawan Darsha Assant and information broker Lorn Pavan, as they were in the possession of a special holocron containing information about the ongoing blockade of Naboo. The Dark Lord, wanting to quickly gain a means of transportation, hacked into Coruscant's security dispatch system, sending out a call reporting a droid banking crime. Two CSF officers, accompanied by a police cruiser backup unit, responded to the call. However, Darth Maul disabled the PCBU by jumping on top of it and destroying the droid with his lightsaber. The officers turned their speeder bikes around, only to be killed by the Sith, who sliced through their armor with his weapon. The Sith then took one of the officer's speeders and continued his pursuit of Pavan and Assant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The CSF later investigated the incident but was unable to explain how someone could jump fifteen feet into the air to reach the PCBU without getting shot. Kenobi was present at the investigation while searching for the missing Assant. He discussed the matter with the two investigators, a Mrlssi and a Sullustan, promising the assistance of the Jedi Order. However, the issue was pushed aside upon his return to the Jedi Temple, as he was sent to respond to the Trade Federation's blockade of Naboo. It was also at that time that the CSF investigated the death of a Hutt nightclub owner and several of his thugs, who had all been killed by Maul in an attempt to find Pavan. A fragment of the report would be found years later by former Imperial aide, Haninum Tyk Rhinann."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Routine investigations"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 22 BBY, Detective Dherik Rule was on duty in Taung Heights area when he took a report from Latika Garboren who claimed finding a Sith emblem in a dollop of pastebread. Rule acknowledged her complaint, however he failed to find a crime to pursue. Rule was later interviewed by HoloNet News about the incident."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon thereafter, CSF investigators responded to the scene of airspeeder collision in the Bindai District. There they discovered the dead body of Senator Nemrileo irm-Drocubac of Tanjay IV. The senator had been traveling in his airspeeder when it collided with a delivery truck. Upon investigating the scene further, investigators came to the conclusion that there had been an internal guidance error. The police did not expect to file any charges in the incident and the senator was laid to rest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later that year, Officer Wets Tranoj investigated the theft of Senator Simon Greyshade's XJ-6 airspeeder. The speeder was discovered thirty minutes after it had been stolen from a Senatorial Quarters parkway. The police were notified of the theft by a security system after seeing a young Human male leap into the vehicle and tear away from the parkway. As the CSF was looking at the found speeder, a youth came out from the Snapping Septoid entertainment facility. Seeing the CSF police officers, the youth started running away from them and yelling. Tranoj arrested the youth, Reymet Autem, and charged him with the theft after he admitted that he had been at Greyshade's quarters. This was somewhat of an embarrassment for all concerned because not only was Reymet the son of Senate Guard Sagoro Autem, but Sagoro was the designated bodyguard of Greyshade, the owner of the stolen speeder."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The speeder again went briefly missing from the crime scene while the CSF processed Reymet Autem. However, the speeder was found returned to its original parking spot at the Senatorial speeder barn. Tranoj explained it as an error by rookie police officer overlooking some paperwork. This allowed its use by the Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi\u2014who had borrowed the speeder to chase down the assassin Zam Wesell after she attempted to assassinate Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala\u2014to go unnoticed."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lieutenant Tan Divo was called to investigate the kidnapping of Chi Eekway and Che Amanwe, the daughters of the Pantoran Chairman Notluwiski Papanoida. However, in their search of Papanoida's apartment, the CSF failed to realize that Papanoida's Icon of the Moon Goddess had been misplaced and so missed the trace amount of blood underneath the statue. After the CSF left the apartment, Chairman Papanoida discovered the blood when replacing his idol. An analysis of the blood showed it to be that of Greedo, a Rodian bounty hunter from Tatooine. Papanoida and his son, Ion, recovered Chi Eekway on Tatooine, and Che Amanwe was found aboard a Trade Federation battleship by Senator Riyo Chuchi and Jedi Padawan Tano, who had been instructed by her Master, Anakin Skywalker, to assist unofficially in the investigation since the Jedi could not officially interfere with a matter delegated to the local police."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Lieutenant Divo, as well as several police droids, later responded to investigate the death of Senator Onaconda Farr of Rodia, who had collapsed after unknowingly drinking a poison. Divo ordered a forensic report on Farr, and the investigation made progress mostly through the assistance of Senators Amidala and Bail Organa. Following Farr's funeral, Divo interrogated several of the senators in the Chancellor's Suite, but Amidala and Organa decided to investigate the murder as well. They followed a lead given to them by Senator Mee Deechi to the Coruscant docks, where they were attacked by Representative Lolo Purs, who had been Farr's assistant as well as his murderer. However, they did not know who had attacked them and were able to catch the attention of a CSF patrol. While the police droids secured the the docks as a crime scene and questioned potential witnesses, Organa and Amidala were given a lecture by Divo for trying to take matters into their own hands. Amidala suspected that Deechi had set them up, but when they returned to the Senate Building, they found that Deechi had been fatally stabbed. With two murders in the Senate, Divo was quick to react when Purs came to claim that she was attacked by Senator Halle Burtoni, a political ally of Deechi. Purs told Divo that she believed Burtoni was the killer, and the inspector arrested Burtoni and attempted to get a confession to both murders from her by showing evidence from his extensive forensic report on Farr. In the ensuing conversation, Purs herself was revealed as the killer of both Farr and Deechi, and after a brief attempt to take Amidala hostage, she was arrested by the CSF."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Declaration of a New Order, the Republic became the Galactic Empire. Policing on Coruscant was reorganized and the majority of the detective division was transferred to the Imperial Security Bureau. This left local precincts to conduct the majority of criminal investigations."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Jedi, Bothans, and Chiefs"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Second Galactic Civil War, Grand Master Luke Skywalker asked Jedi Master Tresina Lobi to keep an eye on his son, Ben Skywalker, who was apprenticed to Jacen Solo. Master Skywalker was concerned with Solo's methods and actions in leading the GAG, as well as with Ben's involvement in them. However, while trailing Ben one night, Master Lobi was ambushed and killed by the Dark Lady of the Sith Lumiya and Dark Jedi Alema Rar. Luke Skywalker and his wife, Mara Jade Skywalker, were notified of the Jedi's death by the CSF and were asked to come to the crime scene. There, they found two detectives, Gwad Raatu and Chal Tozr, as well as several crime scene investigation droids. The Jedi and CSF detectives agreed to work together to find the killer. They were able to track Lumiya to an apartment where they successfully gained entry, but they found the apartment empty and laced with traps. Using the Law Enforcement Tools Provision, Detective Raatu sliced into the apartment's central comm port."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, the CSF Chief of Detectives had sent detectives to investigate the murders of several Bothans, including a Bothan ambassador. When Detectives Raatu and Tozr sliced into Lumyia's comm port, they discovered that she had been responsible for the Bothans' murders. The detectives also found that the apartment was a GAG safe house. The fact that the GAG was behind the murders of the Bothans scared the detectives, especially when the comm port announced that their inquiries were being recorded by the GAG. The detectives, seeing that the situation was out of their control, formally closed the case on the murdered Jedi, leaving the Skywalkers to deal with the GAG."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, an individual used the name of CSF \"Captain Koltstan\" as a front to sign off on the funeral procession for Admiral Cha Niathal, who had committed suicide after Chief of State Natasi Daala ordered that she be arrested and tried for her actions during the recent war. A quick investigation showed that no \"Captain Koltstan\" existed in the CSF, and Daala ordered the CSF to find out who had really paid for the procession. Though they failed to prevent Cal Omas' death, the CSF continued to protect the Chief of State with bodyguards and intelligence information. As a result of Niathal's suicide, Daala's public approval ratings dropped steeply. Therefore, the CSF's protection branch believed that someone might try to attack Daala, and they suggested that she not attend the funeral. Daala was reluctant to comply, but her Chief of Staff, Wynn Dorvan, convinced her to take the CSF's advice. The CSF reported that the threat level against the Chief of State during the procession went up significantly."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
