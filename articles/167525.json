Originally, it was a unit of the Galactic Empire's Imperial Military, but joined Zaarin after his betrayal and fought in his insurrection. They engaged loyalist Imperial forces, most notably those of Thrawn and Darth Vader. His fleet had a technological advantage, as Zaarin led research into new TIE Series fighters. Despite their advantage, the fleet was ultimately defeated."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They had a well sized fleet, ranging from Imperial-class Star Destroyers to Delta-class DX-9 stormtrooper transports. The main fighters included TIE/D Defenders and TIE/ad starfighters. The fleet used a contingent of stormtroopers as a ground force. Nearly every unit in the fleet since the Battle of Ottega was given a \"Z-\" in front of the name to designate it was a member (such as Z-Beta Squadron)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
