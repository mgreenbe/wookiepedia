Consequently, Rebels have been scouting out many inhabited planets for suitable locations. One such group of Rebel scouts emerges over the planet Yorgraxx, only to be confronted by three Guardian-class light cruisers. Despite attempting evasive maneuvers, the Rebels are shot down and crash onto the planet's surface. The crash is noticed by two Imperial scouts who have been stranded on the surface for months. It was for them that the Imperial ships in orbit were searching. The two groups encountered each other on the planet, and were forced to work together to repair a ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, an individual in both factions was Force-sensitive, and both sensed a dark presence in the nearby mountains. Provoked by the presence of a droid, the group set out to investigate. The presence was that of Sith spirit Quorlac Fornayh, who was revived by the crashing of the ship. His awakening was even felt by the Emperor on Coruscant who dispatched Emperor's Hand Jallar Golin to investigate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The combined group eventually made it to Fornayh's fortress where they were attacked by a coloi, a rancor mutant created with Sith alchemy. After overcoming the creature and defeating the spirit, the group emerged from the fortress, only to be confronted by Golin. After finally defeating him, the group was able to leave the planet, although requiring each to decide how to work with the other."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
