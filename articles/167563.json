This weapon was finely balanced and many Zabrak believed that their skill in combat made the use of this particular vibroblade unnecessary. Similarly to other vibroweapons, the blade was protected by a cortosis-weave to minimize damage from lightsabers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
