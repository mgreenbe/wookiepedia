Around seven months before the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY,  the Empire learned that a Rebel Alliance BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber squadron was planning an attack on the Trenchenovu shipyards. To set a trap for the rebels, a squadron of twelve TIE fighters were loaned to the Sanction by the Empire's 204th Imperial Fighter Wing to defend Trenchenovu. The 204th's flagship, the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Pursuer, had been planned to participate, but was forced to divert to a crisis elsewhere."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the rebel attack came, the 204th TIEs ambushed the rebel Y-wings and drove the bombers from the shipyards. The Sanction, meanwhile, was signalled to jump to the Trenchenovu shipyards through hyperspace. The Star Destroyer's arrival forced the rebel squadron to fly back through the shipyards. The 204th's TIE fighters were able to eliminate all but one of the Y-wings, flown by the squadron leader Nath Tensent, which escaped. Months later, Tensent recalled the battle, including the Sanction's arrival, to Yrica Quell, a pilot working for the New Republic's intelligence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sanction was mentioned in the 2019 novel Alphabet Squadron, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
