Unfortunately, on her voyage to Corellia to inform Lando Calrissian and the New Republic of her suspicions, she got caught in the systemwide interdiction field surrounding the Corellian system and was unable to communicate through normal means because of jamming throughout the system. She traveled through the systems in normal space for several weeks, until the field was shut off by Thrackan Sal-Solo. The Gentleman Caller was then able to make the jump and meet up with the Lady Luck."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
