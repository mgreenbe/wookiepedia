The commandos are \"sitting ducks,\" and only the orange-armored trooper survives. He jumps on a droid and steals its jetpack. Another droid fires a stun net at him, and it shorts out his jetpack. He uses the net to lasso and mount the droid, and shoots the other two. He then catches a falling Master Treetower, destroys the droid he is riding on, and jumps back to his rappelling line. They climb back up and soon discover that the cargo is Ugnaught slaves."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
