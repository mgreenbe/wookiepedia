It is unknown if this cyborg was bioengineered from scratch, or if it was originally an organic being who the scientist had given cybernetic modifications to. Whatever the case, it was made to guard the scientist's laboratory. It fought Jaing and Durge as a test when they tried to get into the lab, and was defeated by them, although they spared its life."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
