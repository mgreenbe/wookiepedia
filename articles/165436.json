Manufactured as a product of Arakyd Industries, XJ9-CS14 began life in a factory on the planet Vulpter sometime after the Clone Wars, designed to be a tenacious and exacting hunter. In 3 ABY, the droid was deployed as part of Project Swarm, a galaxy-wide search for the hidden base of the clandestine Alliance to Restore the Republic. It was sent to the snow planet of Hoth, where it traversed icy dunes and battled a ferocious wampa before discovering a deflector shield generator that secretly powered the headquarters of the Rebel Alliance. Although the droid did not believe that the harsh planet was capable of sustaining life, it still transmitted footage of the generator to the forces of the Imperial Navy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After relaying its message, XJ9-CS14 was cornered by rebels and engaged in a small fire fight with the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca. Realizing that its mission was compromised, the probe droid activated its self-destruct mechanism, preventing the Alliance from gathering any of its intel. The droid's message was successfully recieved by the Project Swarm technician Maela who relayed the probot's final transmission up the chain of command all the way to Darth Vader, commander of the Imperial Military.

The droid was designed in a factory sometime after the Clone Wars by the mother of a girl named Maela, a young individual who developed an affinity for probes like XJ9-CS14. By 3 ABY, the droid was stationed aboard the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Avenger as a part of Project Swarm, a massive initiative of the Empire focused on locating the hidden base of the Rebel Alliance through the use of probe droids during the Galactic Civil War. The initial findings of the project yielded no results, however, prompting the Imperial leader Darth Vader to order for a new wave of droids to be sent out."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As one of a hundred thousand probes deployed across the galaxy, XJ9-CS14 was jettisoned from the Avenger in a hyperdrive pod and sent to the Hoth system, an area known to have been used by pirates and smugglers. Arriving in the orbit of the planet also known as Hoth, the droid's pod automatically applied emergency braking thrusters that allowed the planet's gravity to carry it to the surface, crashing near the Nev Ice Flow. XJ9-CS14 managed to complete the landing while remaining in one piece despite the fact that, statistically, a significant number of Viper probes often sustained irreparable damage during planetfall. Unbeknownst to the droid, the planet was occupied by rebels, who had made the system their home only a month earlier. The crash was witnessed by Alliance Commander Luke Skywalker, who assumed the droid's pod was a plummeting meteorite, a common sight on Hoth. Skywalker was unable to investigate further, however, as he was attacked by a wampa,  an ambush predator native to the icy world. The creature, also noticing the probot's crash, took advantage of Skywalker's momentary distraction and struck the rebel."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "XJ9-CS14 cautiously emerged from its pod, scanning its initial surroundings before heading west from the crash site and beginning its full survey of the snowy planet. After being diverted from its course by a large meteorite crater, the droid began to pick up energy readings from Echo Base, the rebel's secret hideout. The probot was then attacked by its own wampa, which was hiding beneath a snow dune. XJ9-CS14 engaged the creature in combat before heading southeast along Clabburn Range. At some point, it also came into contact with a group of tauntauns, bipedal pack creatures utilized by the Alliance. After traveling for several kilometers, it entered Zone Twelve of the hidden base and came across a deflector shield generator utilized by the Alliance, Although it determined that the structure was indeed generating power, the droid's programming did not deem the findings to fulfill the requirements of \"rebel activity,\" with the probe coming to the conclusion that the barren planet was too inhospitable to sustain life forms. Regardless, the probe transmitted visuals of the generator back to the Imperial Navy."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "A chilly reception"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "XJ9-CS14's signal was intercepted by the Rebellion's senior controller Wyron Serper, who alerted General Carlist Rieekan of Alliance High Command. Summoning headquarters personnel Leia Organa and Han Solo, Rieekan and Serper discussed the information with their fellow rebels, who were unfamiliar with the code language that the probe communicated in. After the protocol droid C-3PO alerted the Alliance leaders that the code was potentially Imperial in origin, Captain Solo and his first mate Chewbacca left Echo Base to engage the probe. Believing that the two may require backup, Rieekan ordered Rogue Squadron pilots Ten and Eleven to rendezvous at Station 3-8."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the probot traveled through an area just north of Ceyan Range, it was in the midst of informing its masters that there was no life on the planet when it detected movement by a nearby snowbank. Investigating more closely, the droid discovered the Wookiee Chewbacca and fired three volleys of blaster fire at the furry assailant. Solo emerged from a cluster of rocks behind the probe, striking it with his own blaster. In the midst of the skirmish, XJ9-CS14 began to transmit a signal alerting the Empire to send all available units to its coordinates, but the message was cut short when Captain Solo fired another shot at the droid, causing it to initiate its self-destruct sequence. XJ9-CS14 erupted in an explosion, coating the white dunes in black-metal dust."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Transmissions received"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the droid was damaged beyond repair in the explosion, Alliance Major and materials analyst Capin Harinar was able to determine from the wreckage that the droid was indeed a Viper probe and speculated that Echo Base was compromised. Following the droid's discovery, Rieekan and Organa gave the order to begin the evacuation of the base, believing that Imperial forces would soon come to the planet. During the procedure, the Imperial defector Thane Kyrell was tasked with setting the Alliance's tauntaun mounts loose; the rebel recruit lamented the necessity of the evacuation in the wake of the probe's swift discovery."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the interruption in XJ9-CS14's transmission, fragments of its report reached the girl Maela, who by that point had joined Project Swarm's transmission recovery unit. Immediately suspecting that the structure was of rebel origin, she attempted to take control of the droid remotely just before she lost the probot's feed. Realizing that it had self-destructed, Maela called over fellow transmission analyst Dirjo Harch, who was reluctant to pass the information on to higher authorities in the event that Maela's speculation was proven unfounded. At the behest of his fellow team members, however, he personally sent the message to Captain Firmus Piett of the Super Star Destroyer Executor, the flagship of Darth Vader's Death Squadron."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Piett relayed the report to Admiral Kendal Ozzel, who dismissed the information, believing the generator could have belonged to the simple smugglers the planet was known for instead of the rebels they pursued. Upon the insistence of Lord Vader, however, Death Squadron was ordered to move out to the Hoth system. Word of the impending attack made its way through the Executor, with Lieutenant Nash Windrider informing Lieutenant Commander Ciena Ree of the probe's work in uncovering the base. The news also reached Harch and his crew, who gathered to celebrate their success. Although the girl Maela would have preferred to remain at her station and view Hoth from the lens of another probe on the planet, she reluctantly joined the others, planning to inform her mother of the triumph she had achieved through XJ9-CS14."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Battle of Hoth and continued fame"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Within the next few days Death Squadron arrived at Hoth; Admiral Ozzel, seeking to surprise the rebels, commanded the fleet to exit from hyperspace close to the system. Darth Vader, however, was displeased with Ozzel's tactics, and executed him immediately. When questioned about Vader's motives after the fact by Captain Canonhaus of the Star Destroyer Ultimatum, Commander Tian Karmiya speculated that Ozzel had failed to account for the Alliance's discovery of XJ9-CS14, making his surprise tactics useless. Despite Ozzel's blunder, the Empire's actions on the snow world were massively successful, ensuring that the event that came to be known as the Battle of Hoth was remembered as one of the most devastating losses for the Rebellion in the war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the probot had initially failed to realize the scale of the rebels' presence on Hoth, it would go on to become famed for the part it played in the Galactic Civil War in the following years. During his service with the Resistance, the military organization of an older Leia Organa, decades after the war, Admiral Gial Ackbar resolved to blame Rieekan for the droid's discovery of the base; writing within a collection of Rebellion Era documents known as The Rebel Files, he pondered how the probe had managed to land on Hoth without the Alliance noticing. Fellow Resistance admiral Ushos O. Statura later answered this question, correctly speculating that the droid had masked itself as an impacting asteroid. Another Resistance member, the B1-series battle droid R0-GR, commented on the probe's actions in his \"droidography,\" a book that compiled information on droids throughout galactic history.

It was not until the droid came into contact with the Wookiee Chewbacca that it realized Hoth was home to rebels. In its final transmission, XJ9-CS14 proclaimed its allegiance to the Empire before self-destructing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Project Swarm analyst Maela felt a kind of camaraderie with the droid, as she did with all Viper probes. She considered XJ9-CS14 to be a window into exotic worlds, desiring to approach tauntauns on Hoth just as freely as the probot was able to.

After reading the report of Major Harinar on XJ9-CS14 from shortly before the Battle of Hoth, Poe Dameron, a pilot of the Resistance, regarded the droid with contempt, noting that it and all other probes had no sense of self-preservation. The B1 battle droid R0-GR, who considered XJ9-CS14 to be grotesque, shared similar opinions to Dameron on the probes' longevity, though confessed that he, too, may have considered \"taking the easy way out\" had he been in the same position as the Hoth droid."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "XJ9-CS14 came equipped with a powerful blaster and a self-destruct mechanism that could activate a set of charges surrounding its circular base.

As for the scene in which the droid rises from the crater, a scale model prepared by art director Joe Johnston was used and slowly raised through a miniature set.
