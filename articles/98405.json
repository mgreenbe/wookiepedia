The Vita-Caps were a reward from an optional quest that could be obtained during the Legacy quest line, specifically the portion taking place on the planet Naboo; the quest was titled \"The Life and Death of Jonni Skaak\" and had the player follow Jonni's journey from Royal Naboo Security Forces agent to leader of the Skaak Tippers. Once completed, the player would receive the Vita-Caps as a reward.
