Each year, Knights and Masters alike would flock to the Temple in search of a worthy apprentice to accompany them on missions for the next decade of their life. Students at the Temple prepared for this test, and were often fearful that failure would result in reassignment to the Jedi Service Corps, a worthy yet undesired alternative to taking on missions as a Knight."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Pitting thirty-two apprentices against each other in a series of one-on-one lightsaber duels, each round ended when a student scored three burns on their opponent with a training lightsaber. Before each round began, all of the apprentices would gather around the dueling area while pre-selected members from different classes would face off head-to-head. The final round would consist of the upper class as a group, fighting to the last man standing. The Tournament's first two matches had traditionally taken place in the Combat Training Chamber, until moving onto less artificial environments during the final free-for-all round."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "First Tournament of the Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, the Tournament took place in 20 BBY, before the Battle of Honoghr and the Rendili Fleet Crisis.
