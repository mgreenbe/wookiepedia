The order specifically targeted those who served the Galactic Republic. It was originally a supervision tactic, to keep track of enemies. Those who fell into the category of being watched had to report to an Imperial officer every week. Before long, however, the order allowed targets to be arrested or sentenced to execution. There were those who were able to make themselves \"disappear\" from Imperial files, by erasing their identification documents. This group of people became known as the Erased."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
