A person self-identified as Lloco posted that a friend of his restrained a prisoner with a MCI-200 and failed to watch him; but the prisoner had a hidden comlink and could call for help. Due to this, Lloco suggested that users of MCI-200 should not relax completely, as the item was not perfect."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the times of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, the MCI-200 was used by several bounty hunters, including Tyrn Jiton.

Both sources describe the magnaharness as using the technology of the MagnaCuffs, which is understood as the restraining technology. The MagnaCuffs are also described as using a fingerprint identification system to replace a key, but sources do not detail whether the magnaharness reproduce this or not."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
