After they were modified to shoot blaster cartridges, however, these blasters, despite their inaccuracy at range, could be deadly in close quarter combat. A single shot could easily slice through most body armor. The weapons were in use during the Galactic Civil War on both sides."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The CA-87 shock blaster first appears in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, but also appears in the 2015 canon video game Star Wars Battlefront.
