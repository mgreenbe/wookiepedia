Tonra accompanied Sab\u00e9 to Tatooine where they attempted to free slaves. After Amidala's death, he and Sab\u00e9 decided to find out how she had died, needing to change their identities to do so.

The Trade Federation Droid Army imprisoned Tonra in the prison camp in Theed's largest market square, where he stayed in a tent with the handmaidens Sach\u00e9 and Yan\u00e9 and fellow guard Mariek Panaka. The group quickly got to work organizing resistance against the Droid Army. Tonra wanted to learn about their captors' patrol patterns and defenses, but Mariek took charge and suggested they focus on people first. Together, the two guards came up with a duty schedule and began to collect intelligence from the others in the camp."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tonra saw when a droid patrol took Sach\u00e9 in for questioning, and brought word to the others with such haste that he forgot to give the password. He got tackled to the ground by Mariek for his trouble. He also passed on reports from others in camp that the droids had built an interrogation room and that no one had been able to tell what machinery it was equipped with. He wanted to turn himself in to spare Sach\u00e9 torture; Mariek and Yan\u00e9 forestalled him.

When he asked what she planned to do about it, she said that she would return to Coruscant to start looking for answers. He offered to come with her; she agreed, and told him that they would need to leave everything behind, including any previous identities. While they prepared to leave, Tonra accepted a call on Sab\u00e9's comlink, and told her that she would want to talk to the person on the other end; it was Bail Organa."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The contents of that call are currently lost to history, but Tonra and Sab\u00e9 continued to Coruscant as planned, still not in possession of the full story of Padm\u00e9's death.

They began to shoot at Vader as he stepped into the house, but he anticipated the attack; he knocked Tonra down by throwing a large urn at him with the Force, and Force-choked Typho. Sab\u00e9 talked him down, and asked why they had attacked, since she had sent an all-clear signal. Typho said that as soon as they saw her companion, he and Tonra assumed that she was under duress. When asked, Tonra said that he did not think he could kill Vader, but that he might give Sab\u00e9 a chance to escape; Sab\u00e9 replied that she did not want to be saved by him, but to sacrifice at his side. Vader wanted to kill Tonra and Typho for their attack, but the trio convinced him that because Sab\u00e9 had given Tonra and Typho the recordings, and they in turn had hidden them, Vader would need the men to lead him to the data he wanted."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Deeper and deeper"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The trio led Vader beneath the house, where they boarded a bongo submarine and set off into the waters of Naboo.

After Vader had fended off the beast, Tonra pointed out a nearby hydrostatic bubble, and the group swam to safety. Once inside, Vader demanded that they hand over the security recordings.

The group revealed that, because the last time Typho saw Amidala she was on her way to Mustafar, and they had discovered that Mustafar was Vader's domain, they had come to the conclusion that Vader had killed both Amidala and her Jedi protector, Anakin Skywalker.

It crumbled, throwing Vader out of the bubble and into the beast's mouth. After Vader both killed the sando aqua monster and broke through the Amidalan's defense of Amidala's tomb, he learned that Amidala had been treated at Polis Massa before her death. He instructed Sab\u00e9 to meet him there with her friends. The Amidalans arrived at Polis Massa Base with a fleet of ships, and once more attempted to confront Vader. Their ships proved an obstacle as Vader attempted to reach the medical facility there, but he managed to distract them long enough for his death troopers to shoot down one of the ships. As Amidalans marched out of the fallen ship to confront Vader on the ground, Tonra was in the front rank.
