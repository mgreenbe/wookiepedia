He and a group of refugees, led by an Anomid named Darshyn, lived and worked at the Alien Outreach Center in Nar Shaddaa's High Security Lockdown district, providing aid to fellow victims and displaced persons. Around 3653 BBY, a young Human girl named Kira Carsen joined the group, and Enaq became friends with her. Carsen bundled herself in extra layers of clothing in order to look bigger and tougher than she really was."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Carsen stayed with the group for eight years, but during that time, a gang known as the Ur'kossags began to terrorize the refugees and rob them. When Carsen paid them a visit and asked them to leave the refugees alone, the Ur'kossags offered the girl membership in their group, asking her to kill a rival gangster as a test. She refused and was forced to kill the entire group with her nascent Force powers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Carsen was recruited into the Jedi Order not long afterward, so she was unaware of how her actions affected Enaq and the others\u2014because of the Ur'kossags' deaths, the refugees acquired a formidable reputation that prevented other gang attacks but also turned away groups that would typically offer aid, though additional refugees continued to seek aid. Two years later, Enaq contacted Carsen and requested supplies and aid, and she readily responded, bringing along her new Jedi Master. However, Enaq and Carsen's reunion was disrupted by a furious Darshyn, who blamed the girl for their lack of supplies and the reputation that her actions gave them. Disheartened, Carsen departed, though she promised to return again soon with more supplies."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An Evocii refugee, Enaq had tan skin and blue eyes, as well as black sideburns and a small amount of black hair atop his head.
