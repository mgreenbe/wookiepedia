The Skyscreamers swallowed small pieces of blue stone imbued with the Living Force to strengthen their connection to the Force\u2014what they called \"stonepower\"\u2014and then prayed in meditation a \"skyscream\" to the Force with the hope that a follower of the Force from beyond the Vagadarr star system would feel a disturbance in the Force and follow the Force's guidance to their war-torn world. Their faithful prayers were answered when during or before 32 BBY, Jedi Grand Master Yoda felt the Skyscreamers' calling and undertook a mission to the Vagadarr system as a result of hearing the skyscream prayer."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
