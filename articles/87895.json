Maul is forced to partake in several of these matches during his investigation into Iram Radique's whereabouts. However, as his investigation unfolds, Maul soon discovers the true nature of his mission; he is to contact Radique in order to buy a nuclear device that had been secretly built inside Cog Hive Seven.
