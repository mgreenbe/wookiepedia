Captain Vitala Baize decided to infiltrate the organization, using the identity of Trins Evnar, a Chirq Council member in Doaba Guerfel. An independent spacer who previously worked for the CorSec thus killed Trins Evnar, as well as every other Chirq Council criminals who used to know him. As Jzoro Quanera did not know personally Trins Evnar, the CorSec agent assumed Evnar's identity towards him and successfully managed to lure the underboss. The CorSec agent thus joined Quanera's group and started to work for the underboss. After having completed several missions for him, the agent was finally allowed to have full access to Jzoro Quanera's bunker, including its database. From Quanera's database, the CorSec obtained the identity of the nine elite councilors who ruled the Chirq Council and the locations of their secret headquarters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around the same time, a group of Chirq Council henchmen working for Quanera stole three racing durnis belonging to the animal handler Galvain Tark.
