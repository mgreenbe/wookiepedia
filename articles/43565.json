Their son Paul disappeared one day and remained missing for years, during which the couple struggled together. By 3643 BBY they found themselves in the refugee camp outside Fort Garnik, just on the outskirts of the war zone. It was at this time that Ellis was informed by a woman named Jenna that she saw her son alive at Mannett Point, by this time a separatist-controlled territory. Suddenly having hope again, Ellis convinced a friendly Republic individual to confirm whether it was indeed her son. As it turned out, Paul was indeed alive but pumped with rage-inducing stimulants to the point that he did not remember his own name, much less his parents. He was taken off the stims, but was still a danger to others due to extreme aggressiveness, and to avoid facing his parents like this, Paul fled Ord Mantell until the effects of the stims wore off."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
