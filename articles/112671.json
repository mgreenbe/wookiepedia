The Reckless Abandon delivered supplies to Borleias while it held out against the Yuuzhan Vong, delivering much needed goods and support to the embattled garrison. Escorted by New Republic starfighter pilot Wes Janson and his Taanab Yellow Aces, the Reckless Abandon set out for Borleias, loaded with munitions, foodstuffs, ammunition and several barrels of Taanab fruit brandy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When it came out of hyperspace in the Pyria system, the Reckless Abandon and its fighter escorts emerged in a dovin basal minefield positioned by the Yuuzhan Vong. Yorik-et, Yuuzhan Vong starfighters, converged on the transport, but it was able to be protected by Janson and his squadron. One of the capital ships defending Borleias, the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Mon Mothma, moved to aid the Reckless Abandon as it performed a series of microjumps towards Borleias. The Reckless Abandon was then protected by starfighters from another New Republic Star Destroyer, the Imperial I-class Rebel Dream, as well as Twin Suns Squadron. With so many New Republic starships defending it, the transport made its way towards Borleias."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Reckless Abandon arrived safely at the planet, but not before its captain had to intervene on the New Republic military communications channel in order to ask Janson to refrain from his flirting with Jaina Solo, Twin Suns One.
