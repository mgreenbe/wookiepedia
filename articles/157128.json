This platoon was commanded by a number of officers including Valin Hess. The platoon guarded the Morak Imperial refinery where the Imperials were mining and refining rhydonium. The base was known to be run by Imperial Security Bureau agents who set up extreme security measures."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By 9 ABY, the Mandalorian Din Djarin and his allies undertook a mission to Morak seeking the location of Moff Gideon's Imperial remnant. Disguised as Juggernaut Pilots, Djarin and Migs Mayfeld infiltrated the Imperial refinery while piloting Juggernaut Five, one of several Imperial Combat Assault Transports operated by the Morak remnants. Along the way, they were attacked by Shydopp pirates who attempted to destroy the transport's rhydonium supply. Djarin held off the attackers long enough for the Imperial remnant to intervene, believing that the infiltrators were fellow Imperial soldiers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The platoon deployed from the refinery's entrance to protect the cargo transport from the remaining pirates. Stormtroopers and shoretroopers formed a defense line behind the Juggernaut and opened fire on the pirates, killing them on sight. Mayfeld and Djarin were welcomed into the facility; unaware of their true identities, the troopers saluted the infiltrators as they drove by."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The platoon first appeared in \"Chapter 15: The Believer\" and was confirmed to be a platoon by the episode's descriptive audio."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
