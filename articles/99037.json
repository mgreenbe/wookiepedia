There, he teamed up with fellow Jedi Kalifa and Jinx, evading their captors in the jungle covering Island Four. Around 21 BBY, Padawan Ahsoka Tano was brought to the moon, and persuaded them to fight openly rather than continue hiding. Following Kalifa\"s death, the group\u2014supported by a newly arrived Chewbacca\u2014attacked the Trandoshans' base of operations, overwhelming the defenders when Wookiee reinforcements arrived."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "O-Mer was a Jedi youngling who went on a training mission along with fellow younglings Kalifa and Jinx when he was captured by Trandoshan hunters and was brought to Wasskah. He and the other two younglings were then hunted for sport. They survived for a long period of time alone, which eventually caused them to abandon their Jedi ways for their survival."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 21 BBY, Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano arrived on the moon after being captured during the Second Battle of Felucia. The three Padawans found her and returned with her to their hideout. The next morning they set out so that the Trandoshans didn't pick up their scent. Ahsoka, however, was appalled when O-Mer and the other Padawans watched two other victims die at the hands of the hunters without acting. She left the group, determined to act but was attacked by another Trandoshan. O-Mer and Jinx subdued him and Tano only just prevented Kalifa from killing him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Trandoshan called for help, they were forced to flee. Ahsoka came up with the idea to discover the Trandoshan base and the next morning they all set out. It was O-Mer who was observant enough to spot the base hovering above the island. A Trandoshan attack forced the Padawans to split up, and Jinx and O-Mer were chased through the underbrush by Sochek, but they managed to evade the hunter. The two then returned to their base. Ahsoka returned with the sad news that Kalifa had been killed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After that, the three remaining Padawans made an attack on the beach, killing two Trandoshans and finding a captive Chewbacca.
