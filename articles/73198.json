It was built over a deep crater as a deterrent towards rebellious slaves and was commanded by Keeper Agruss. During the Clone Wars, a Togruta artisan colony was abducted from Kiros system and brought to the facility. Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Clone Captain Rex were enslaved there too after an unsuccessful rescue attempt of Governor Gupat Roshti, who was imprisoned on Zygerria."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soon, Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano learned of the facility's location and spearheaded an attack by the 104th Battalion, led by Jedi General Plo Koon and Admiral Barton Coburn. Although Agruss attempted to kill the slaves on Count Dooku's orders, a cruiser was maneuvered beneath the facility to prevent most of them from falling to their deaths. Afterwards, Rex killed Agruss with an electrostaff, and the Republic gunships destroyed the facility."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
