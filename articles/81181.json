In the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Endor, during which the Galactic Empire suffered a massive defeat at the hands of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Duvat was at the helm of the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Torment. Less than seventeen days after the battle, the captain was told to rendezvous with a messenger at Rendezvous Point: Victim in the Outer Rim Territories. Once the red-clad envoy finally boarded the Torment, Duvat discovered that his visitor carried a top secret message that allegedly came from Emperor Sheev Palpatine himself. Although the Emperor had actually died during the Battle of Endor, the captain dismissed it as enemy propaganda. Convinced that he was following the Emperor's orders, Duvat set a new course for the planet of Naboo. Upon entering the planet's orbit, Duvat's ship deployed a climate disruption array that would scour the surface of Naboo with storms and hurricanes. Eventually, Lando Calrissian and the Restoration attacked his ship and drove him away from Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
