It was one of many observatories that Emperor Palpatine, also the Dark Lord of the Sith, established across the galaxy. Each observatory looked beyond the galactic rim with the intent of finding what laid beyond the known galaxy, and each had a specific purpose. The Pillio observatory contained a number of items the Emperor had collected before his death, such as a compass. The bunker had no locking or unlocking mechanism, and it could only be opened with the Force."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, while he was still Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic, Sheev Palpatine felt the call of unknown space from beyond the galactic rim. He wanted to explore the Unknown Regions and galaxies that laid beyond his own, and even theorized that such unexplored space could be the source of his dark side powers. He built observatories, such as the one on Pillio, as part of that exploration and used this one to store several artifacts."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, Palpatine\u2014ruler of the Galactic Empire\u2014was killed during the Battle of Endor.

At the same time, Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker also traveled to Pillio. He felt called to Pillio by the Force, and the arrival of Imperial troops confirmed his suspicions that there was something special on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Skywalker destroyed the Imperial forces he encountered and saved Meeko, who was trapped after an encounter with scritters who lived in Pillio, the two worked together to find the Emperor's Observatory; neither felt the other was truly their enemy. The Jedi opened the door with the Force when they arrived, and Meeko realized that the Emperor\u2014the man who destroyed the Jedi Order\u2014could also use the powers of the Force. Once inside, Meeko felt that none of the items were of any value or worth the Emperor protecting, but Skywalker discovered the Emperor's compass. Meeko allowed him to keep it, and Skywalker convinced Meeko not to destroy the Observatory. The Empire, Skywalker said, had already inflicted enough damage on innocent worlds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Emperor's Observatory on Pillio was introduced in a mission during the single player campaign of Star Wars Battlefront II.
