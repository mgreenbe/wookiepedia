She was the daughter of Marg Krim and Tezzka Krim. Laalee also had an older brother named Vram. During the second year of the Clone Wars, her father Krim became the leader of the Pyke Syndicate, a crime syndicate which specialized in the distribution of illicit spice products throughout the galaxy. When Krim rejected an offer by the Black Sun to merge their two syndicates, the Black Sun's leader Ziton Moj retaliated by kidnapping Laalee, her mother, and her brother. Laalee and her family members were held hostage at the Black Sun fortress on Mustafar in an effort to force Krim to accede to Black Sun's demands."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Laalee and her family were imprisoned in the \"house\" at the top of a tower that dominated the fortress. During her imprisonment, she and her brother were forcibly separated from their mother Tezzka, who was dragged by several Falleen guards into Ziton's palace. He father Marg was greatly distressed by his family's kidnapping and hired the bounty hunters Asajj Ventress and Quinlan Vos to recover Laalee, her brother, and her mother. After learning the location of where Laalee and her family were being housed, Ventress and Vos infiltrated the fortress using an exposed balcony."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Laalee and her brother Vram were peering through the \"house's\" windows when they saw the two hunters climbing over the balcony. While Ventress disabled the controls, Vos slipped through the now-open window and told the children that they were here to rescue them. He also told them to trust them and to keep as quiet as possible. The Force-sensitive Vos, an undercover Jedi, also managed to use his Force abilities to calm the children. When Vos asked where their mother was, Laalee burst into tears while Vram told the rescuer that the Black Sun guards had taken their mother away."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly later, an alarm was raised and Black Sun guards began entering the tower to apprehend the intruders. Unwilling to fight through the guards, Ventress and Vos opted to used their Force powers to leap down the tower's battlements to the ground where their lava flea steeds were waiting. For their escape, Laalee and Vram piggy-backed Ventress and Vos respectfully. With Laalee on her back, Ventress managed to leap over the battlements and boulders and make her way safely back to her lava flea. However, Vos was hit on the back by a blaster bolt, causing Vram to plummet to a lava flow below. Fortunately for Vram, Vos used his Force powers to levitate the child to safety."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Laalee and Vram were taken by their rescuers to Ventress' starship Banshee. While Ventress tended to Vos' wound, Laalee and her brother listened to music in a corner of the hold. Later, Vos borrowed Laalee's locket and used his psychometric abilities to pinpoint the location of their mother. Through the locket, Vos deduced that Tezzka was still in Zition's palace within the fortress complex. Using this information, Vos and Ventress hatched a plan to rescue their mother. As a safety precaution, Ventress had Laalee and her brother secured to containment chairs so that the children would not accidentally damage or destroy her ship."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Ventress posed as a Pyke Syndicate negotiator, Vos managed to free Tezzka from her cell.

Vos and Ventress then took Laalee and her family back to Oba Diah were they were reunited with Marg.
