It was not especially large, and had been well-scouted over the centuries of the Inner Zuma's existence. Many legends surrounded the Endor Gate: some spacers told stories of ships that had been found drifting in space whose captains swore they were on the other side of the galaxy before their ships went dead. It was through this gate that C-3PO, R2-D2, and Prince Plooz returned to their time period after accidentally traveling to the far future. It was also rumored to have been the wormhole responsible for depositing the glove of Darth Vader at the Mon Calamari system."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
