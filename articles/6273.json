During Operation Skyhook, the CR90 corvette Jeffrey and the BFF-1 bulk freighter Ojai were tasked to deliver some communications satellites stolen from Orron III to the Rebel outpost. During their rendezvous with the transport Magnus in the Cron Drift, they were attacked by Imperial Assault Gunboats and stormtrooper transports. Imperial forces were defeated thanks to the intervention of X-wing starfighters from the Calamari Cruiser Independence. AX-235 was the very outpost that then intercepted an Imperial transmission with the schematics of the Death Star."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the importance of the information, the Alliance dispatched Biggs Darklighter in an T-65 X-wing starfighter to retrieve it. However, after leaving AX-235, Darklighter's X-wing broke down and he came under attack by Imperial forces led by the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Intrepid. The Independence sent three A-wings to protect him. They engaged many TIE bombers and Assault Gunboats, as well as three Lambda-class shuttles tasked to capture the pilot of the disabled X-wing, until a Rebel rescue team could arrive and repair his ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After escaping the attack he delivered the plans to the Independence."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
