After suffering huge losses in a subsequent clash at Vontor, Kossak enlisted the service of the Vodran, Nikto, and Weequay species and triumphed over Xim in a final confrontation on the same world. Xim was captured and sent to Kossak's dungeons on Varl. Revered by his progeniture and called the greatest Hutt in history, Kossak was a source of great pride and inspiration among Hutts, and his name was used as an oath, with Zorba Desilijic Tiure claiming to be a descendant."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
