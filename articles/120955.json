Scoggan grew tired of working for Plutt, so he, along with the Trandoshan Davjan Igo, established a scheme to steal from their employer. The two created Tanandra Frullich, a program imitating a dating service user, intending to learn Plutt's secrets. However, the Crolute discovered Scoggan and Igo's plot, so he locked the two in the wreckage of an All Terrain Armored Transport.
