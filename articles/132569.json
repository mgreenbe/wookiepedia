It gives players the ability to purchase and customize in-game homes, or \"strongholds\", as well as guild capital ships. Unlike all other expansions, Galactic Strongholds includes no new story content, and instead serves to add the Stronghold, Decoration, and Conquest systems to the game. Several additional Strongholds have been added in the years since the expansion's release in Game Update 2.10, and decorations are a frequent in-game reward and also commonly found in Cartel Market packs."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Development"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Announcement and promotion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the beginning of the year, BioWare announced that they would be releasing two more expansions in 2014 after Galactic Starfighter, which was released in February. Galactic Strongholds was not confirmed or even hinted at during this time. Prior to the official announcement, Galactic Strongholds was teased as the \"SSHP\", or \"Super Secret Housing Project\". On one of the game's community live streams, the developers released a short teaser displaying a character walking through an apartment on Coruscant. Nothing else was said about the expansion until the official announcement on March 19."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Much like the release of Galactic Starfighter, there were a variety of benefits announced for subscribers and preferred access players.

Subscribers and preferred access players were given new early access dates of August 19, and September 16. The full release was delayed to October 14, 2014. Along with early access, Subscribers will be given a free Nar Shaddaa apartment, a \"Stronghold Label\", and a Character title. Preferred players will be granted the label and the title, but without the free apartment. When the expansion is released to the public in October, they will only receive the title. When the expansion's delay was confirmed, additional content was also announced. Players will be able to purchase a stronghold on the planet of Tatooine, as well as use their guild ships to compete with other guilds for the control of a planet. Features inside strongholds will be expanded as well, allowing players to place pets, companions, and vehicles inside their homes as they please."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Planets"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
