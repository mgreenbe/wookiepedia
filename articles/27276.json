Around the time the Treaty of Coruscant was signed, clan member Zadik Lone fell in love with fellow Mandalorian Akaavi Spar. Spar left her own clan to be with Lone among his kinsmen, though tragedy would strike when Spar's clan was betrayed and executed by the Sith Empire. Spar urged Clan Lone to rally to her clan's aid per Mandalorian tradition, but the members of Clan Lone refused to go against the Empire. Spar ended her relationship with Zadik, and broke all ties with Clan Lone, leaving to pursue the architects of her family's deaths. Because of their refusal to heed Spar's call for assistance, Clan Lone was dishonored, and many of its members fell in with the false clan of Tayari Rook, the very man responsible for setting up Clan Spar's downfall. When Akaavi Spar found Rook and his people operating in an encampment on the planet Nal Hutta, she attacked and killed anyone who chose to fight instead of flee."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clan Lone was first introduced into Star Wars canon in the massively multiplayer online game, Star Wars: The Old Republic, created by BioWare and released December 20, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
