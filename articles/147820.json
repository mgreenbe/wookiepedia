The center contained hotels, shops, and gardens. From the disc were quarter-kilometer-long spokes, each which ended in luxury pods that were 40 meters thick and 250 meters across. Six were disc-shaped and six were triangular, with the variants alternating. Each pod could be self-sustaining if need be. One of the triangular pods was called the Narsacc Habitat."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The station was run by a group of Kuati merchant families, and did not offer single rooms. The cheapest sections available had a daily rent that was the same as the yearly earning of a middle-class family.

Supreme Commander Gilad Pellaeon and Prime Minister Aidel Saxan were selected to represent the Alliance and Corellia, respectively. Luke Skywalker led a detachment of Jedi to defend the negotiators."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the first day of negotiations, Lumiya arrived disguised as a Kuati mercantile princess with a team of drugged commandos provided by Thrackan Sal-Solo. Using her powers, she convinced Captain Siron Tawaler to provide navigation details to the delegation's chambers, and then promptly disposed of Tawaler through an airlock. The rabid commandos struck at each delegation, and succeeded in killing Prime Minister Saxan. The talks were a failure; Aidel Saxan's former husband Denjax Teppler stepped in to replace her; and the only clues to the mastermind behind it was a piece of cloth representing a variety of Force-based cultures, including the Sith."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
