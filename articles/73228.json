Late in the battle, Admiral Raddus ordered Oquon\u00e9 to ram his corvette into the side of a disabled Star Destroyer, causing it to crash into the second Star Destroyer and then into the Shield Gate protecting Scarif. This disabled the Shield Gate and allowed the Rebels on Scarif to transmit the Death Star plans to Raddus. The Lightmaker, along with its skeleton crew, was destroyed in the crash. Oquon\u00e9's actions resulted in the capture of the Death Star plans by the Rebels, which were later used to exploit a weakness in the battle station and destroy it during the Battle of Yavin."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kado Oquon\u00e9 was portrayed by British actor Angus Wright in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
