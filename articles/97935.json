The crew of five Trandoshans travelled on their own prisoner ship and had already picked up four sentient aliens. Their next stop was Kashyyyk to capture some Wookiees. Upon arrival, one of the other slavers, Kootan expressed his interest in killing and skinning a Wookiee. Noka reminded Kootan that they needed live wookiees to take to the Xonti Brothers. Noka used a scanner to locate a Wookiee and the five of them vectored towards one's position. When they reached the wookiee, Noka and Kootan snuck up on their prey only to discover it was unconscious. Black Krrsantan shot at them, killing one of the other slavers. Kootan ordered the rest the party to fire and another hunter was gunned down as they began to respond to the threat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Krrsantan shot down another slaver, forcing Noka and Kootan to take cover behind a tree. The two realised that the unconscious Wookiee had been bait and Kootan made an attempt to kill Krrsantan, only to be knocked out by the black Wookiee. Krrsantan threw Kootan into another tree, killing him on impact. The Wookiee then stood over Noka and demanded that he take him to meet the Xonti Brothers. The slaver took Krrsantan onboard his ship and transported him to the Xonti Brothers. He made himself a drink and asked the Wookiee what would have happened if he wasn't affiliated with the Xonti Brothers. The Wookiee responded that he would have killed the slaver. Noka got Krrsantan and the other four aliens to the Xonti Brothers, where they were trained to be gladiators."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, Noka met with Dixnet Dat and Domthro Rus and told them his story.
