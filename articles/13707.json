In 3640 BBY, the Dark Councilor Darth Marr requested that Davidge, the Minister of Logistics, review the situation in the Boranall system to see if it was worth suppressing the recent rebellions on the star system's three habitable planets. Davidge's analysis indicated that the Empire would be better off abandoning their efforts there, as the cost of a protracted campaign in the system would negatively affect the Empire's military resources. However, Marr decided that an example needed to be made of the Boranall system, and he ordered Davidge to contact Darth Karrid, a newly-appointed Dark Councilor and the commander of the prototype warship Ascendant Spear, as she was still in the sector. Despite Davidge's misgivings, he complied with Marr's orders and convinced Karrid to deploy the Spear by playing up the Republic threat in the region."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon Karrid's arrival in the Boranall system, she used the Spear to destroy the Republic Navy vessels there before turning her ship's weapons on the planet Boranall.
