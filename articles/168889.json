Ulldin warned the Warrior that he could not prevail against two Jedi Knights and demanded that the Sith surrender. Zylixx, however, expected the Warrior to engage them in battle, as all the Sith they had faced did. Rather than draw his lightsaber, the Warrior chose to goad Zylixx into giving into his anger and lash out, forcing Ulldin's hand. The two Knights engaged the Sith in a duel, but were easily defeated. Zylixx was the first to be slain by the deadly apprentice before he was this close in giving in to the dark side, leaving his companion Ulldin badly injured and at the Sith's mercy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Depending on the player's choices, Zylixx's fate can be decided many different ways:"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
