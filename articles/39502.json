Reder joined the Imperial Navy and was a junior officer holding the rank of commander, who served aboard the Star Destroyer Pulsar while it was stationed in the Endor system during the construction of the second Death Star. During the Battle of Endor, the Pulsar surrendered to Alliance to Restore the Republic forces. Reder avoided capture, and led a group of Imperial crewmen, including Niclara Varnillian, who stole an Alliance transport and escaped. Reder joined Admiral Gaen Drommel's forces, where he was raised to the rank of Captain and given command of the Star Destroyer Krieger. Around 5 ABY, Reder and Admiral Drommel used information in the stolen transport's computers to discover the location of several Alliance safe worlds and bases. A quick and effective campaign resulted in the deaths of thousands of individuals. By 7 ABY, the New Republic Intelligence Service recorded the Krieger's last known location as the Hanod system.
