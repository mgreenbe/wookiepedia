When the task force realized that the Republic starship Leveler was in the system, the Reaper broke off from the rest of the taskforce, to go and capture the Leveler. The crew of the Leveler detected the Reaper's approach towards their position, but mistakenly identified it as the Confederate light cruiser Discord.
