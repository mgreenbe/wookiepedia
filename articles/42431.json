He was a distant cousin of Lady Domina Tagge of the Tagge Corporation, whose company was privately involved with Drake. Drake was invited to take part in what he claimed was an incredible opportunity, mentioning the event to Tagge, but did not make contact after departing aboard the luxury starship Opal Empress. Tagge sent the rogue archaeologist Doctor Chelli Aphra and the smuggler Sana Starros to find Drake and ascertain what the opportunity was, hoping to take advantage of it if her cousin did not. After boarding the Opal Empress, Aphra and Starros found that Drake and the other passengers aboard had been killed by the parasites known as cymotes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
