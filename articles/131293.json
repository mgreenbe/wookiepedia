It was announced on May 9, 2006 at E3. The expansion adds several new maps and units, as well as an additional storyline revolving around the conquest of Tyber Zann and new types of gameplay, including playing as the Zann Consortium, a powerful crime organization and syndicate. It was released on October 24, 2006 in North America and later released with the base game as Star Wars: Empire At War Gold Pack on Steam on 25 May 2010. It was also Matthew Sloan's first game to voice Darth Vader."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Opening Crawl"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Gameplay"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Campaign"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The campaign follows the conquest of the intergalactic crime lord, Tyber Zann, and his underworld organization, the Zann Consortium between the events of the destruction of the first and second Death Star and right up to the climactic theft of the Eclipse, an Eclipse-class dreadnought. Tyber Zann corrupts planets with his Defilers in order to obtain information of the other two factions, sabotage, and to gain credits. In the campaign, Tyber also tries to unlock the secrets of an ancient Sith holocron, which Silri later uses to find the ancient Carbonite Sith Army."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Conquest"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Galactic Conquest gameplay remains very similar to the original Star Wars: Empire at War with a few major changes. The Zann Consortium's new corruption element is a new feature which provides bonuses to the competing factions in addition to the benefits provided to the Zann Consortium. Units produced from Cantinas and using bounty hunters to neutralize heroes cost significantly less on corrupted planets. As an additional bonus to Rebels, smugglers do not expire on corrupted worlds. Also, the original Death Star no longer appears, being replaced by the second one after being destroyed in the original game. The same goes for Red Squadron, which has been reformed into Rogue Squadron. Alderaan is now an asteroid field. Rather than being mod-only, as in the first game, the Executor now is fully playable in Galactic Conquest mode, and is the most powerful combat unit in the game. Also, when a faction wins the war (e.g., all enemy planets are captured/destroyed, both enemy leaders are killed, etc.) there is no end cutscene; the game instead skips immediately to the credits, unlike in the last game. However, this may be due to the fact that, unlike in the last game, there is now only one story mode (Zann Consortium) and thus one end cutscene for both the story and Galactic Conquest, which, in the case of the latter, may not be an appropriate ending based on the way the player won the mode."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Skirmish"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Skirmish has been changed slightly, while still keeping to the original game. One major difference is 3 faction battles, and the ability to fight the same faction (mirror battles)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Land skirmish battles feature a new base building mechanic \u2013 outposts. Outposts can be captured like buildpads. Once captured, outposts build one of 3 structures, depending on the faction. The Mining Facility and Hutt Palace can be built by any faction while the other structure is unique to each faction: Repulsorlift Jammer (Zann Consortium only), Uplink Station (Rebellion only), and M-68 planetary magnapulse cannon (Empire only)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Space skirmish battles are also similar to Empire at War, with some differences.
