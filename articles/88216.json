The camps were located in the mountains near the city of Nashal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Around 1 ABY, those Meatlumps attacked Sul Prine's house near the city of Dearic and smashed several speeder bikes. When Vani Korr, a Corellia Times reporter who was investigating the Meatlumps, learned of this attack, she tasked a spacer to investigate. The spacer met Sul Prine and then used a map lost by one of the Meatlumps during the attack to localize their camp. The adventurer attacked the camp, killing some Meatlumps in the process, and forced the others to reveal the identity of their leader: Strilath Farles."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Meatlump Camps were a location in the 2003 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars Galaxies, prior to the game's closure on December 15, 2011.
