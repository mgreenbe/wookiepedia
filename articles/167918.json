It was located on an outgrowth of the Atollon Coral Mesa outside the main area of the base, between the Atollon command center and repair pads. Inside the container, Orrelios stored some of his personal effects and attached to its side was a shelf below a makeshift shade that he used as both bunk and workspace. He also kept a receiver at the hideout and used it to play inspirational music. The side of the cargo container was decorated with a poster of the Lasat Boscoface and other illustrations, including a stormtrooper helmet and the head of a Rodian."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Members of Phoenix Cell avoided disturbing Orrelios while he relaxed at his hideout unless there was an emergency and only close friends would join him if he was resting or watching the sunset. Prior to Orrelios' fellow Spectres, Kanan Jarrus and Ezra Bridger, Mission to Malachor, Bridger joined him at the hideout while he listened to music and watched the sunset. The pair discussed the upcoming mission and Bridger shared his fears that he wouldn't return. Orrelios comforted his friend, reassured him that he would come back, and joked that in the time he would be away, Phoenix Cell would have already overthrown the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zeb's Hideout first appeared in the 2016 Star Wars Rebels episode \"The Mystery of Chopper Base.\" It was later identified in the 2018 Fantasy Flight Games sourcebook, Dawn of Rebellion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
