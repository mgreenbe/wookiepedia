The Y-wing attack starfighters targeted Imperial cargo containers and arriving transports, including the cargo ferries Slainte and Lesyta and the modular conveyors Posi and Mhath. Meanwhile, A-wing interceptors from Blue Squadron engaged the platform's defensive fighter screen of TIE/LN starfighters and deep patrol Alpha-class Xg-1 Star Wing fighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The escort shuttle, flagged as an Imperial ship, entered the system and proceeded to dock with Elliirad Platform amidst the fighting. However, the shuttle had been recently stolen by Rebel forces and commandeered by the elite Katarn Commandos. The unit stormed Elliirad Platform, stealing supplies and setting explosive charges. As the shuttle departed Elliirad Platform, the Imperial station exploded, allowing the remaining Y-wings to close to laser range of the cargo containers and transports without coming under fire from Elliirad Platform's turbolaser batteries."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite this apparent turning point, the Empire struck back with the entry of the Striker, an Imperial I-class Star Destroyer, to the battle zone. While the Striker was far out of range, it deployed several flight groups of fast-moving TIE/IN interceptors, which quickly moved to engage the Rebel craft."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although Elliirad Platform was lost and the Katarn Commandos' mission was successful, the outcome of the battle is unknown.
