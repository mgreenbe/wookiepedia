In about 31 BBY, Uffel's security chief HG-211 hired a group freelance agents to investigate some acts of sabotage that had been carried out by the rogue droid LN-73. While they performed their mission, IT-R9 was assigned by the droids of Uffel Research and Development to follow the agents around, to learn more about the problem-solving capabilities of organic beings. After the agents had finished examining Uffel's droid manufacturing facilities, HG-211 ordered IT-R9 to leave them and report back to the R&D droids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "IT-R9 was a small, silver-colored, spherical floating droid.
