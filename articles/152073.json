During this time, the city was under the control of the Galactic Empire, and became a haven for Imperial bounty hunters. At some point, five Gran bounty hunters entered the man's establishment for a round of drinks. When the time came to pay for the beverages, the Gran named Shmorg offered to pay for the entire tab. However, a different Gran offered to pay for the drinks instead. The resulting confusion of who was going to pay for the drinks ultimately led to an unarmed brawl, and the bartender frantically called for the Gran to not use blasters inside his tavern. As the fight broke out, the bartender hurriedly ran around behind his bar table as two of the Gran were beaten to death."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Moments after the brawl broke out, the New Republic Jedi Initiate Kyle Katarn, who was in Barons Hed to disrupt Imperial activities, entered the bar.

The bartender, none to happy with the fact that his paying customers were all lying dead on the floor, gruffly noted that he did not appreciate Katarn's antics.
