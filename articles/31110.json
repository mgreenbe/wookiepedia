When the call for the Twist would be made, ships would engage in a screen formation, suggesting to eavesdroppers that the screen formation was what was meant by the order. The Twist was also used with other numbers, signified by the count upon which the screen formation broke up. Thus, saying, \"On three; One...Two...Three...\" would mean to modify the coordinates by three."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
