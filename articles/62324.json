Ohnaka's first entrance into the conflict was a major one, as he managed to capture the leader of the Confederacy, Count Dooku, as well as the Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. Ohnaka was unsuccessful in ransoming the trio, but his influence was far from diminished. Throughout the rest of the war, the pirate frequently encountered Kenobi, Skywalker, and Ahsoka Tano in both helpful and antagonistic roles. Ohnaka's tenuous relationship with the Republic was not reciprocated in the Confederacy, and his base was destroyed by Confederate General Grievous under the order of Dooku. Despite the destruction of his base and a brief fracture of his gang, Ohnaka managed to survive the duration of the war."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The end of the Clone Wars saw the rise of the Galactic Empire, under whose rule the Ohnaka Gang was broken up, and the once-great pirate cast adrift as a small-time smuggler and outlaw. While on his own, Ohnaka encountered several notable people during his exploits, chief among them the young Jedi fugitive and revolutionary Ezra Bridger. Ohnaka became an ally to Bridger and his rebel crew, the Spectres, in their fight against the Empire. Ohnaka's friendship with Ezra culminated in his help in liberating the planet Lothal from the grip of the Empire. Ohnaka authored the Book of Hondo, an outline of his philosophy that inspired many well-known outlaws, before later creating shipping company Ohnaka Transport Solutions, which he ran on the planet Batuu."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early life"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A male Weequay from the planet Sriluur, Hondo Ohnaka was born to his mother.

Ohnaka later became a pirate, eventually rising to become the leader of a pirate group called the Ohnaka Gang, which operated a base on the planet Florrum. He also had pet Kowakian monkey-lizards named Pilf Mukmuk and Pikk Mukmuk.

Ohnaka and his men then took Dooku captive. Realizing that Count Dooku was an important Separatist leader, Ohnaka hoped that he could make a lot of money by selling Dooku to the Republic. Hondo contacted the Republic via hologram and displayed the captive Count to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine while demanding a ransom of one million credits worth of spice.
