The Rakata believed that the native Kumumgah, who had fought the Rakata ever since they had conquered Tatooine in 25,793 BBY, were responsible for the plague, and the Rakatan bombardment glassed the verdant world. Over the centuries, the glass developed into a planet-wide desert, and the Kumumgah devolved into two species: the Jawas and the Tusken Raiders. By the time Revan traveled to Tatooine during his quest for the Rakatan Star Maps, only basic information about this conflict managed to survive in the form of oral history of the Tusken Raiders."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
