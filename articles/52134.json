Since 5000 BBY, Kesh had been ruled by several millennia by a Human Sith Tribe who had become stranded during the Great Hyperspace War. While Grand Lord Varner Hilts was a relatively progressive and moderate Sith who had allowed the indigenous Keshiri, a purple-skinned near-Human species, to join the Tribe, Sith rule still remained harsh and repressive for many slaves. By 2974 BBY, Galathos was placed in charge of the port town of Eorm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Many of Eorm's inhabitants were the descendants of Human slaves who had been expelled from the Tribe and sentenced to generational slavery. These slaves included the descendants of Ermon Parrah, one of the original Sith colonists who had come aboard the ancient Sith starship Omen. Parrah had led an unsuccessful attempt to steal the crippled Omen from the Kesh Sith Temple and return to the stars. As punishment, Parrah and his descendants were forced to weave a cord that would reach the stars. Since this task was physically impossible, Parrah's descendants remained slaves for millennia and became known as the Spinner family since most of them work as tailors and weavers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of Parrah's descendants was the Sith criminal Parlan Spinner who was sentenced to work aboard a Keshiri expedition that was sent to explore Eshkrene, the planet's south pole.

Spinner also freed the ancient Sith Lord Remulus Dreypa from his oubliette. Dreypa had been one of the early founders of the Sith Order and sought to return to the stars in order to seek revenge against the Jedi and the Galactic Republic.

When a Keshiri man tried to reason with Lord Galathos, the Sith Lord attempted to Force-choke him. However, Galathos was interrupted by Lord Dreypa who killed the Sith Lord with Force lightning. Following the death of Galathos, Dreypa then used the Force to killing Galathos' remaining men and to level several buildings.

Ultimately, Dreypa was defeated following a brief but violent insurrection which devastated parts of Keshtah including Tahv.
