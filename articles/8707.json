Grennen decided to investigate the influence of the dark side of the Force on the moon of Yavin 4, and studied the Jedi Order's libraries on Tython before traveling there himself. Grennen kept a journal on Yavin 4 in which he detailed his studies about Naga Sadow, Freedon Nadd, and Exar Kun. While on Yavin 4, he encountered the Massassi species. The longer he stayed there, the more Grennen was affected by the dark side; the final entries in his journals saw him rant about how he had wanted to find Exar Kun and become the next Sith in his line. He foresaw the arrival of Revan, and was ultimately driven mad and killed by the spirit of the Sith Emperor."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
