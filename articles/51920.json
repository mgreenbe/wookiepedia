The origins of rebellion could be traced to the Clone Wars, when rebel cells were equipped by the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order to fight against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. After Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, transformed the Republic into the Empire and destroyed the Jedi Order, many rebel cells began fighting the Empire. A number of these cells eventually joined together and became the Alliance to Restore the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The war had officially begun by the year 4 BBY. The Rebel Alliance was officially created in 2 BBY with Mon Mothma's Declaration of the Rebel Alliance. In 0 BBY, the Alliance scored its first major victory against the Empire by stealing the plans to the Death Star, the Empire's planet-destroying battle station, in the Battle of Scarif. The plans were brought to the Rebel Alliance by Princess Leia Organa, with the help of companions such as Luke Skywalker and Han Solo. An analysis of the plans led the Rebels to launch the Battle of Yavin, in which Skywalker, with Solo's assistance, destroyed the Death Star. A series of follow-up attacks by the Alliance, including an assault on the Empire's primary weapons factory, left the Empire reeling from the Alliance's advances. As a result, the Empire hunted the Alliance across the galaxy under the leadership of Darth Vader, a Dark Lord of the Sith and the Emperor's chief enforcer. Vader's forces located the Alliance on the planet Hoth. The resulting Battle of Hoth forced the Alliance to flee the snow planet and sent its fleet into hiding."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Six months later, in the year 4 ABY, the Emperor allowed the Alliance to learn of the existence of a second Death Star as part of a trap to lure the Alliance to its destruction. The Alliance, believing that they were launching a surprise attack, assembled their entire fleet and attempted to destroy the Death Star. A large Imperial fleet lay in wait, and the two forces met in what would become known as the Battle of Endor. During the battle, Skywalker, who had learned that Vader was his father, confronted the Dark Lord in a final lightsaber duel aboard the Death Star. The Emperor attempted to kill Skywalker, but out of compassion for him Vader threw the Emperor down a deep shaft and to his death, fulfilling his destiny as the Chosen One and destroying the Sith. Vader, once again Anakin Skywalker, died from injuries he sustained during the battle, bringing an end to the Sith's rule over the galaxy.

One year later, the Empire fought the New Republic, the democratic government established by the Rebel Alliance, in a final stand over the desert world of Jakku. However, the Empire led by Counselor Gallius Rax was defeated, and, facing severe internal unrest, the titular leader of the Empire, Grand Vizier Mas Amedda, surrendered to the Republic.

The role the Jedi played in the war caused their numbers to dwindle, both from the losses they suffered on the battlefield and from certain individuals like Barriss Offee who rebelled against the Order for abandoning its beliefs. They also began to lose support among not only the political elite of the Republic but also the growing military leadership of the Grand Army and a galactic population that they had become increasingly distant from.

However, this was a play to prevent his enemies from gathering enough strength to openly act against him. He reorganized the former Galactic Senate of the Republic into the new Imperial Senate. Although this new body did not possess as much power as its predecessor, it did retain the ability to pass legislation. Most Senators refrained from engaging in direct criticism of the Emperor as the Empire grew stronger, but the Senate soon became divided between followers of the New Order and those who still wished for a return to democracy. These Senators worked as hard as they could to rein in the Empire's excesses and soon became as the only check to the Emperor's power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Most prominent among the Emperor's silent opposition were former members of the Loyalist Committee, such as Bail Organa of Alderaan and Mon Mothma of Chandrila, who hoped that they could make a difference from the inside, but to no avail. Nevertheless, they came to hold enough weight in the Senate to influence the Empire's decisions, as the new regime's higher-levels constantly feared a potential uprising against their rule. Chief among their achievements, the Senators limited the influence of the new Imperial Military by outlawing the forced conscription of stormtroopers, regular beings brought into the Empire's service after the clone troopers were phased out of military service, and preventing beings from being sold into slavery for failing to honor debt commitment. Following the brutal suppression of the planet Lasan and the near-genocide of its people, they banned the use of T-7 ion disruptor rifles after they were used on the Lasat. And they tried to alleviate the suffering of populations caught in the Empire's web of expansion. When the planet Wobani became snared in the Commodities Enhancement Program, their economy collapsed due to their inability to meet the Empire's quotas and a severe humanitarian crisis occurred on the world. Senators Organa and Mothma, along with their allies in the Senate, negotiated with the Empire for weeks to ensure the relocation of Wobani's citizens.

However, as the movement grew and the atrocities worsened, this growing movement began to entertain the notion that armed resistance would be the only way to save the galaxy. Using covers and hiding their dealings, they began to channel funds towards the formation of a united military under a banner of rebellion. Once-isolated groups of insurgents, such as Saw Gerrera's Partisans and Enfys Nest's Cloud-Riders, were united and given common goals to accomplish while remaining as discreet as possible. Other cells were hidden from view completely, establishing bases on remote worlds like Crait and shipyards to refit civilian vessels for military use.

Barely a few hundred of the once ten-thousand strong Order escaped with their lives. Several more fell into a trap set by Darth Vader as the Jedi Temple fell, who sent out a message to all surviving Jedi to return to Coruscant.

Some, such as Yoda and Kenobi, hid until they were ready to emerge and defeat the Sith. Others, such as former Padawan Caleb Dume, took different names and set aside their Jedi ways to avoid detection, moving on whenever their identity was at risk of being discovered. Others turned their attention to other concerns: former Jedi Librarian Jocasta Nu built an underground school which contained a new Jedi archive for future Jedi students she intended to train to rebuild the Order. Her attempts ended with her death at the hands of Darth Vader after she infiltrated the former Jedi Temple to recover a list of Force-sensitive children who had been identified by the Jedi for recruitment. Other Jedi made it their task to resist the newly formed Empire from its inception: a former Padawan named Ferren Barr used the Force to compel several opponents of the Empire to join him on a quest to turn the galaxy against the Emperor. Inspired by visions of rebellion led by the aquatic Mon Calamari people, he began advising Lee-Char, King of Mon Cala, to resist the Empire. However, Barr's manipulations led to the Empire's invasion of Mon Cala, in the first Imperial show of force against a rebellious world. Like Jocasta Nu, ex-Jedi Knight Cere Junda and ex-Padawan Cal Kestis worked together to try to rebuild the Jedi Order. The two looked for a holocron that contained a list of Force-sensitive children that had been hidden by Jedi Master Eno Cordova in Bogano. Although they obtained the holocron after some conflicts with the Empire and even a confrontation with Vader, the two decided to destroy the holocron so that the children on the list were safe from the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As time went by and the Empire's oppression grew, several Jedi who had hidden in the shadows began to emerge and take the fight to their longtime enemies and their rule of the galaxy. Unlike Ferren Barr's early attempt at rebellion, these Jedi chose to keep their identities hidden as long as possible to avoid drawing the Empire's attention on their efforts. One of the most important of these beings to assist the growing movements emerging against the Empire was actually a former Jedi: former Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who had left the Jedi Order shortly before the end of the Clone Wars. Hiding away on an agricultural moon called Raada in 18 BBY, Tano got caught up in a grassroots resistance movement when the Empire invaded Raada to produce the herbs needed for their nutrients, causing irreversible damage to the crops in the process. Tano's actions caught the attention of Senator Organa, who had been secretly looking for surviving Jedi since the Purge had begun. The senator recruited Tano into the fledgling opposition that he had been building, giving her charge of its nascent intelligence network. Tano created the \"Fulcrum\" agents, a network of undercover agents operating under this common name to mask their numbers. Their task would be to gather intelligence on Imperial activities and recruit more individuals and groups to form a larger movement against the Empire. The Fulcrum agents kept their identities secret even from the cells they handled while providing with supplies and information to target Imperial interests while protecting the secret of their larger plan. One cell that was recruited by Tano under her guise as Fulcrum was the Spectres, who operated in the Lothal sector. This cell distinguished itself by the presence of a Jedi in its ranks. Kanan Jarrus, the new name of Caleb Dume, eventually took on an apprentice of his own, Ezra Bridger, in 5 BBY."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, while some Jedi hid and others began to join or found rebellious movements, a darker path was open for survivors of the Purge. Concerned that surviving Jedi or other Force-sensitive beings would be a threat to his rule, the Emperor created the Inquisitorius, a cadre of former Jedi who had forsaken their allegiance and fallen to the dark side of the Force. Trained in the dark arts by Darth Vader while not given access to the full power of the Sith Lords, the Inquisitors were given two missions. The first was to hunt down the surviving Jedi whenever they appeared, for which they were granted an Imperial writ signed by the Emperor that any opposition to their actions would be taken as an act of war against the Empire. The second was to track down other Force-sensitive beings in the galaxy, such as children who might be trained as Inquisitors themselves. A program led by the Inquisitors, codenamed Project Harvester, monitored Imperial Academies to identify such beings and remove them before they could grow too powerful and potentially challenge the Emperor. This mission also included tracking down trained Force-sensitives threats to the Empire, namely the one that the Inquisitors came to know as the \"shadow\": Darth Sidious's former apprentice, Darth Maul. Having survived the Clone Wars, Maul rebuilt his power in the criminal underworld by leading the syndicate known as the Crimson Dawn. He would later be tracked to the forgotten Sith world of Malachor by the Eighth Brother, a confrontation that would eventually include Ahsoka Tano, Kanan Jarrus and Ezra Bridger, as well as two further Inquisitors: the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister.

Imperial authorities worked hard to eliminate reminders of the Jedi, occupying sites that had once been important to their religion, such as the Holy City of Jedha or the ice planet Ilum. And even among the highest ranks of the Empire, knowledge of both the Force and their practitioners was limited. Some Imperial officers, such as Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, had known the Jedi during the Clone Wars, but others hadn't.

The Empire's intelligence agents and military forces moved in ruthlessly to deal with any rebellious worlds that showed signs of large-scale resistance to Imperial rule. However, the Empire was unable to stem the coming together of rebel groups across the galaxy, many of which were brought together as rebel cells under a clandestine network organized by figures such as Senators Bail Organa and Mon Mothma and their allies.
