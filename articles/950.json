Equipped with an enhanced targeting system for its turret mounted laser cannon and dual heavy cannons, and reinforced with armor plating for added defense, a fighter tank of the 282nd was more accurate, but less maneuverable, than its counterpart in the 96th Regiment. Heavily armored AT-AP walkers added troop support to supplement the Republic fighter tanks in accomplishing mission objectives."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The 282nd Regiment was seen fighting the Separatist Droid Army on Geonosis during the early part of the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
