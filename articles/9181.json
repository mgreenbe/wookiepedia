Following the Battle of Portocari in 0 BBY, she along with other surviving members of the squadron, came to the bar \"Zero Angle\" on the flying base of the Oversector of the Shining Diamond. There, after drinking alcohol, she raised a conversation with fellow soldiers, questioning the incorrect information that they flew on as well as the deaths of their comrades Riggs and Chan. Her assumption that the Empire had strained all forces to fight the enemy without sparing people and throwing them into battle for any reason received confirmation when Commander Weller brought the news about the destruction of the Death Star by the rebels."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
