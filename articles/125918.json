He witnessed Anakin's fall from Zam's Koro-2 all-environment exodrive airspeeder and watched as he regained himself and continued pursuing Zam. While so, the Bith stroked his chin, most likely a gesture of confusion. While in the Outlander Club and on the streets of Coruscant, the Bith wore a cheap suit of a greenish tint.
