She saw him for the first time as he made what she referred to as \"\u2026a reckless, show-off jump from a Wroshyr tree, made over a needlessly long distance, flirting with death, and an utterly childish thing to do\". Chewbacca's jump was quite impressive, and right then at that moment, she knew Chewbacca had to be hers. However, she was too nervous to admit her feelings for him. To get Chewbacca to notice her, Malla turned to Chewbacca's cousin for help. Their first acquaintance was followed by a traditional courtship, though some of their flirtations did not go so well. Later on, they were caught by Trandoshan slavers, but Chewbacca confronted these slavers, pulling a few arms off along the way. However, after these events, they maintained only a close friendship."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Romantic relationship"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chewbacca was later enslaved by the Galactic Empire and only after his rescue by Han Solo and his return, his relationship with Malla became more romantically involved.

Unbeknownst to Malla, her brother Vargi and several defected Wookiees were a part of the operation. Once Chewbacca, Han, and Lando Calrissian were able to break free, the three proceeded to end the operation. With the help of the Alliance, the battle ended and all of those who were involved were apprehended. Upset at his involvement and betrayal, Malla disowned Vargi as her brother."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "She constantly worried about her son's growing desire to be like his father during the New Republic's early years. Because of this, Malla considered letting Lumpy stay with the Solos on Coruscant. During a trip to Coruscant with his father, Lumpawarrump was captured while trying to capture thieves that broke into the Solos' apartment. Lumpawarrump became captured, and Chewbacca and Mallatobuck discovered that the burglars were planning to assassinate the New Republic's leaders. Determined to stop them, they infiltrated the enemies' base to find an advanced IT-3 interrogation droid masterminding the plot. The Wookiees rescued their son and foiled the droid's plans. After the incident, Malla decided that Lumpy would be safer on Kashyyyk.
