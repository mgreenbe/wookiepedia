He was part of the Gullet Gang in the Terrabe sector. He was later employed by Gallandro for the Varcinius Repository vault job. He used data gathered by sensors inside the Varcinius Repository to program the bodysuits worn by Kilitz and Kling. This allowed them to avoid tripping temperature alarms while they were inside. After leaving Gallandro, he took a contract with the Droid Gotra but broke it. As punishment, they made him duel a succession of droid duelists and he was killed by the eleventh one."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
