The plate, which curved inwards at either side, was large enough to carry both Rey and her rucksack. She utilized a fuel port as a fastening grommet, and re-purposed the fabric of a parachute to line the inner face of the sled. She fastened a strap to the board, allowing her to guide the sled during travel, or to pull it along behind her while walking."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rey created the makeshift sled on Jakku, and utilized it to help her descend quickly down the planet's dunes.
