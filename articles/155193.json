She was a round, hairless individual with wide eyes and taut skin. On each of her hands she had seven fingers slender enough to be mistaken for tentacles, as well as two opposable thumbs. Her anatomy made her well suited to her profession as her large eyes provided excellent vision and her two thumbs allowed her to operate two holo-scribers at once, items she used whilst forging. By the year 5 BBY she was living on the planet Nar Hekka within Hutt Space, where she was considered the best ID forger available. In that year the smuggler Han Solo found her by asking around taverns on Nar Hekka and asked her to forge identification for him and his Wookiee partner Chewbacca. She gave them the false names Garris Kyll and Arrikabukk respectively and charged them a large sum of credits for the service."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tsyklen forger first appeared in the novel The Hutt Gambit released in 1997, which was the second book in The Han Solo Trilogy written by A.
