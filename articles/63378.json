The interior of each droid was designed to be a detainment platform for captured starships, with tractor beam projectors covering the droid's outer hull, ready to drag wayward ships into one of several internal docking bays."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following capture, prisoners would be held inside the droid, until the Imperial officer in charge was notified of the capture and had determined the appropriate course of action.
