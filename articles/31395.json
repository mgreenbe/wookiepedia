A well-educated man of refined manner and much literary knowledge, he was considered to have a distinctly beetle-like appearance, due to his stick-like limbs and pudgy body. Starting out as a small-time criminal working on Corellia early in the Galactic Civil War, he eventually moved to Pembric II in the Kathol sector, where law enforcement was almost non-existent. He and numerous fellow criminals merged their organizations and formed the Bombaasa Cartel, as a means of protection from large organizations, such as that of the Hutts. With Bombaasa at its head, the cartel became very influential in the Pembric system, and after Imperial Moff Kentor Sarne pulled out of the area in 8 ABY, Bombaasa seized control of Pembric II, making it a haven for smugglers, pirates, swoop gangs, and myriad other criminals. He had dealings with the New Republic envoy FarStar soon thereafter, but was able to repel any attempts by the Republic at diminishing his power."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He remained on Pembric II for many more years, increasing in power and stature until his territory covered many systems. He eventually grew bored of the Kathol sector, and left to become an underling of Borga, the most powerful Hutt of the time. Bombaasa operated from a giant, nine hundred meter-long freighter named Starmaster, and was in charge of Hutt operations and spice smuggling in the Tynnani system and the Bothan worlds. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, he helped Borga feed information to the New Republic about impending targets of the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong invaders, but after the Hutts' demise he became a member of Talon Karrde's reformed Smugglers' Alliance. Bombaasa contributed to the Galactic Alliance victory over the Yuuzhan Vong at the Recapture of Coruscant in 29 ABY, and along with Karrde, smuggler Booster Terrik, and Lando Calrissian, he pledged to change his ways and make an honest living."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rise"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Crev Bombaasa originally hailed from Corellia. A cultured, well-educated man with a taste for sharp suits and expensive jewelry, he had an insect-like appearance and a genteel, refined manner. Despite this, however, he was known to have a vicious streak, and became a criminal early in his life. He operated predominantly in the Outer Rim, proving himself to be a competent crime lord with no qualms about doing harm to others, though he avoided doing any of the dirty work personally, as he abhorred participating in physical violence. During the Galactic Civil War, between 1.5 and 3.5 ABY, Bombaasa was in the employ of Shalera the Hutt and several other criminals, offering various services. He worked for Shalera in Tyrena, Corellia, often collecting dirt on her rivals or enemies for use as blackmail. Prior to the Battle of Hoth, he had a Bothan informant named Sli'woon Biul follow small-time criminal Didina Lippinoss and prepare a report on her activities. Lippinoss worked for Karrek Flim, a Viceprex of the Corporate Sector Authority, performing various activities for him that would stain his reputation if made public; Flim was not cooperating with Shalera, so Bombaasa sought to blackmail Lippinoss. He sent a spacer to collect Biul's report, which he found more than satisfactory; he attempted to blackmail Lippinoss, threatening to make public the information if she would not provide him with secret Corporate Sector Authority information. She refused, and subsequently sent a bounty hunter, Morrng, to kill Bombaasa. The Corellian had the spacer who had previously worked for him intercept and kill the bounty hunter. However, Bombaasa recognized that his feud with Lippinoss would not end until one of them perished."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some time later, Bombaasa relocated to the Kathol sector in the Outer Rim, a largely lawless area of the galaxy where entrepreneurial \"businessmen\" such as Bombaasa could make great profit. Pembric II in particular was a world mired with corruption and crime, which the Empire largely ignored, and Bombaasa operated from that world. Bombaasa's criminal organization was successful but small, like many others in the region, so he decided to form an umbrella organization consisting of various criminal enterprises similar to his own. The Bombaasa Cartel, as it became known, was a loose collection of Bombaasa's fellow criminals, and it wielded significant influence on Pembric II. Bombaasa's cartel was unable to compete on a level akin to the Hutts or other large syndicates, but it protected smaller criminal organizations such as his own from such large groups. The cartel also maintained a number of legitimate mining and shipping enterprises, building up a network of smugglers, shippers, and Imperial contacts which served a multitude of purposes. Bombaasa supported the local Des'maric Pirates, feeding them freighter travel plans so they could plan their assaults. He also bought off senior members of the gang in an effort to assume control of the group, and his biggest success was subverting Ginzet, the trusted lieutenant and friend of the pirates' leader, Miktiss. Bombaasa owned a number of sites on Pembric II, including the highly-popular ThrusterBurn Tapcafe, a tapcafe atypical of most similar locales in that it was bright and airy. Order was always maintained in the ThrusterBurn, with rowdy or troublesome individuals dealt with quickly and harshly. Bombaasa spent much of his time at the ThrusterBurn, gambling in the casino at the back. He tended to enjoy great success there."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 4 ABY, after the death of Emperor Palpatine and the fragmentation of the Empire, the Imperial moff of the Kathol sector, Kentor Sarne, withdrew the sector from the Empire and installed himself as a warlord dictator. While he ruled with an iron fist on most worlds, Sarne entered into a precarious alliance with the Bombaasa Cartel, allowing them to continue with their shady activities unencumbered in exchange for a link with the underworld and all the services it provided. Despite their allegiance, Sarne barely trusted Bombaasa, and the feeling was mutual. Bombaasa had faith in no one who had been in contact with Sarne; when Gaelin, an expert slicer native to Pembric II who had previously left to work for Sarne on Kal'Shebbol, returned to his homeworld, Bombaasa had him and his computers shut away in a subterranean laboratory, fearing he was still on Sarne's payroll. His suspicions of Gaelin were not unwarranted, though, as the slicer had in actuality been sent to monitor Bombaasa for Sarne. Even after being locked away, he was still able to send regular reports on the crime lord's activities back to Sarne on Kal'Shebbol."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Dealings with the FarStar"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For several years, Bombaasa personally continued to rise in prominence until he effectively ruled Pembric II. In 8 ABY, after the New Republic had captured sector capital Kal'Shebbol, Sarne pulled out of Pembric II entirely. The cartel acted quickly, taking control and purging the planet of all Imperial loyalists. Bombaasa's methods of keeping control on the criminal- and cutthroat-ridden planet were described as ruthless, but they were very successful. Bombaasa and his men soon learned of the New Republic's victory at Kal'Shebbol, and that Republic forces were making inroads into the rest of the Kathol sector. Fearing Republic interference with their criminal activities, the cartel installed a puppet government with supposedly pro-Imperial tendencies on Pembric, hoping to discourage the New Republic from approaching. Bombaasa also froze practically all travel off the planet, with only those able to pay extremely high \"tariffs\" allowed to leave. The cartel began building up arms, with the corrupt Pembric Security Legion patrolling the system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A short time later, the New Republic arrived in the Pembric system. A local mining outpost identified a ship hovering around the edge of the system as the FarStar, a New Republic vessel. The information was relayed to Bombaasa and his underlings, who believed its covert presence was a prelude to a full-scale Republic invasion attempt. They monitored the ship after it sent a shuttle down to the surface; one of Bombaasa's foremost agents, the Rodian Kebbo, met the shuttle's occupants upon their arrival and directed them toward the ThrusterBurn tapcafe. While the Republic agents, posing as illegal arms merchants, conversed with manager Breslin Drake, Kebbo notified Bombaasa of their arrival. The crime lord wanted to speak with the agents personally, and Kebbo took them to the casino."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bombaasa dispensed with pleasantries entirely, informing the Republic agents that he knew who they were and making it clear that they were not welcome. He also made it known that he was aware of the New Republic presence in the system. He requested that they provide him with a guarantee that the New Republic would not encroach on his \"pro-Imperial\" territory, and assurances that the FarStar was not the spearhead of an impending attack by the New Republic. He suspected they did not have clearance to make such a guarantee, and told them that if this was the case they were to leave Pembric II post-haste, though they attempted to persuade Bombaasa that the New Republic had no intention of invading Pembric. He mocked them about the need to purchase a highly expensive travel permit, without which they would be stranded on the planet. However, they had already acquired some through other means, which sparked a confrontation between Kebbo and his backup Legionnaires. A firefight ensued, with Breslin Drake\u2014the manager of the tapcafe, who was also a former New Republic Intelligence Service operative\u2014and his bouncers assisting the New Republic agents, in the hopes that the agents would be able to help them find passage offworld. The group\u2014consisting of the New Republic envoys, Drake, and the ThrusterBurn's bouncers\u2014ultimately fled Kebbo and a fuming Bombaasa. Kebbo had the escapees' shuttle watched, though to no avail. The New Republic ambassadors broke into Gaelin's laboratory and freed him to use his expertise on their ship, and they were eventually able to escape back to the FarStar, along with Drake and his bouncers."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Karrde's visit"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bombaasa's power and stature continued to increase, and he continued to act as the effective leader of Pembric II for more than ten years. However, he had many enemies. Around five years after the FarStar's departure from Pembric II, an assassination plot was instigated against Bombaasa. Two individuals, Mara Jade and Lando Calrissian, of whom Bombaasa knew nothing aside from their appearances, foiled the attempt. Jade told Bombaasa they worked for a \"chieftain,\" whose true identity also eluded the crime lord; they refused to accept any payment, and Bombaasa never saw them again. By 19 ABY, he ran most of the illegal operations in the region of the Kathol sector that encompassed the Pembric system, and some referred to him as \"Lord Bombaasa.\" It was considered wise for any outsiders passing through the region to first get clearance from Bombaasa, which usually cost an inordinate amount of money. Bombaasa's organization also developed ties with the Hutts, though he kept these as secret as he could; the Hutts often provided him with information on potential rivals. During this time, a new slaving ring cropped up in Bombaasa's territory. Led by the Rodian Rei'Kas, the group had relocated from another area, and were considered to be particularly vicious by the cartel. Despite his efforts, Bombaasa and his forces were unable to either eliminate Rei'Kas or take control of his syndicate, and for over a year the Rodians proved particularly resilient and troublesome toward the cartel. At their height, the pirate syndicate possessed a sizable fleet of SoroSuub Corsair-class assault starfighters and other, larger vessels, and they preyed upon Bombaasa's freighters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 19 ABY, Pembric II was visited by the Wild Karrde, operating under the guise of the Hab Camber, the ship used by Talon Karrde, a powerful crime lord and information broker; Bombaasa, however, had no idea who he was, knowing only that he seemed suspicious. Karrde left his ship in the company of an attractive woman, and Bombaasa had them followed; he suspected he might have been sent by the New Republic to coax Pembric into joining it. Karrde and his companion made their way to the ThrusterBurn, before entering an altercation with a gang of swoop riders, who had refused them entry. Bombaasa watched via remote hologram coverage as Karrde's accomplice\u2014Shada D'ukal, his bodyguard and a former member of the Mistryl Shadow Guard\u2014incapacitated all the bikers bar one, whom Karrde downed personally. Bombaasa then communicated with Karrde\u2014whose identity he was still unaware of\u2014from inside the casino via a hidden speaker; the information broker wanted to recall an old debt, the nature of which Bombaasa did not recall, and, intrigued, the cartel leader invited Karrde in to meet him face-to-face inside the casino."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Karrde and D'ukal entered shortly, exchanging pleasantries with Bombaasa. Karrde revealed that he had been the mysterious \"chieftain\" of whom the two individuals who'd saved Bombaasa's life several years prior had spoken. Karrde wanted to call in the debt and gain Bombaasa's clearance to travel through his region unhindered, to conduct business. Warming to the man because of his the previous actions of his underlings, Bombaasa agreed to provide Karrde's ship with a special ID overlay that would identify it as being under the cartel's protection. However, he warned Karrde of the increasing activity of Rei'Kas and his fellow pirates, explaining that they could expect no protection from them. After finally revealing his identity to Bombaasa\u2014and his knowledge of the cartel's ties with the Hutts\u2014Karrde departed; the two postulated that they might meet again in the future. Karrde did indeed run into Rei'Kas during his journey, but the Rodian's fleet was destroyed by the Aing-Tii, a species of monks in the Kathol sector who despised slavery."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Working for the Hutts"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bombaasa ultimately grew bored with life in the Pembric system. By 25 ABY, he had begun to work directly for the Hutts, leaving the Kathol sector for the Outer Rim, Expansion Region, and Mid Rim. He worked predominantly in the lucrative spice trade, and was in charge of Hutt operations in many systems, including the Tynnani and Both systems. He worked as a direct subordinate of Borga Besadii Diori, leader of the Besadii clan and the most powerful Hutt of the time. Operating out of worlds like Ryloth, where spice was mined and easily exported, he and his men used the freighter Starmaster\u2014a giant ship, approximately nine hundred meters long, equaling the size of a Victory-class Star Destroyer\u2014as their headquarters. Scores of tenders, gunboats, and shuttles as well as a costly Ubrikkian Industries luxury yacht were constantly tethered to it. During the six years between Karrde's visit to Pembric II and 25 ABY, Bombaasa mellowed somewhat; while still committed crime on a regular basis, the viciousness for which he was renowned was less apparent. However, in 25 ABY, the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong struck at the galaxy, waging war on the New Republic and any others who stood in their path. The Hutts had mixed fortunes as a result; the despair brought by the Yuuzhan Vong War meant even more sentients were turning to spice as a means of escape, resulting in increased revenue, but Hutt Space was in risk of being attacked. Before the Yuuzhan Vong struck, Borga formed an uneasy alliance with the invaders, but the Hutts were in constant fear of being betrayed."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Yuuzhan Vong provided Borga with intelligence on which worlds were due to be attacked. Still fearful that the aliens planned to backstab her, the Hutt decided to surreptitiously feed the New Republic with information, in the hopes that it would come to her aid if and when the Yuuzhan Vong betrayed the Hutts. When she learned her temporary allies planned to attack Corellia, Tynna, and Bothawui\u2014the latter two of which were in Bombaasa's territory\u2014she ordered her subordinates to immediately suspend the spice trade within the planets' systems, hoping that the New Republic would pick up on it and fortify the systems accordingly. From his ship in orbit above Ryloth, Bombaasa did as he was instructed, focusing all his efforts elsewhere. Borga informed Bombaasa of her reasons for doing so, making him one of few with the knowledge. A short time later, the Wild Karrde docked with the Starmaster, and a number of beings boarded the massive freighter to meet with Bombaasa's underlings, among them Rol'Waran, a local. Rol'Waran identified two of the beings as Karrde and D'ukal\u2014the others were Jedi Knights Ganner Rhysode and Kyp Durron\u2014though Bombaasa ordered him to go ahead with the meeting as planned. Karrde wished to purchase a large amount of spice, asking for it to be delivered into Tynna and, when Rol'Waran refused that, Bothawui. This was out of character for Karrde, a man who had never really been interested in spice and who had somewhat \"legitimized\" himself shortly after his brief time in the Kathol sector in 19 ABY; deducing that Karrde had noticed the peculiar and sudden change in shipping patterns, Bombaasa revealed himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Karrde was surprised to see Bombaasa, unaware that the Corellian had left Pembric. Both men treated each other cordially, but Bombaasa made it clear his debt to Karrde had been repaid and that the information broker could expect no similar favors from him. Bombaasa ordered Karrde to stop lying about wanting in on the spice trade and to tell him exactly why he was on the Starmaster; Karrde replied with a short speech about how the times were changing and that former enemies were working with each other. Bombaasa agreed, and though Karrde made it clear he would continue to work on the New Republic's behalf, Bombaasa was unsure which side of the line he stood on; above all else, he wanted to live comfortably. Despite this, he implied to Karrde that Borga had ordered him to suspend trading into Tynna and Bothawui because of Yuuzhan Vong intelligence, and tacitly informed him that Borga was playing both sides, intentionally allowing the likes of Karrde to warn the New Republic of impending attacks. Karrde thanked him for his help, promising to put in a good word for Bombaasa to the New Republic, and postulating that, eventually, smugglers, pirates, mercenaries and other fringers might form an alliance to help repel the Yuuzhan Vong."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Shifting allegiances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bombaasa subsequently traveled to Nal Hutta to apprise Borga of the situation with Karrde; meanwhile, Tynna was conquered by the Yuuzhan Vong. Borga was due to meet with Yuuzhan Vong Supreme Commander Nas Choka, Commander Malik Carr, and Nom Anor, the latter of which had had previous dealings with her in the guise of \"Pedric Cuf,\" New Republic traitor. Borga recalled many of her trusted confidants, including Bombaasa, Pazda Desilijic Tiure, Gardulla Besadii the Younger, and former Hutt ambassador to the New Republic Golga Besadii Fir, to listen in, hidden, on the conversation between Borga and the Yuuzhan Vong. Nas Choka declined Borga's offer to transport captives for the invaders in exchange for further forewarning of any planned invasions, though he agreed to inform the Hutts of his activities as he saw fit. Choka also informed Borga that she could resume trading into the Bothan worlds, as they were no longer being considered as a target; however, he warned that, should she share the information with any third party, she and Hutt Space would be in dire peril.

Borga also feared that the web of backstabbing between the Hutts and the Yuuzhan Vong was growing too intricate; she was unsure whether Choka was using her to feed the New Republic with false information. Ultimately, she ordered Bombaasa to triple all spice shipments into the Both system, hoping to make it clear to the New Republic that Corellia was Choka's intended desire. Bombaasa preached caution, reminding Borga of her promise to Choka and the consequences that would ensue if the Supreme Commander caught wind of her deception and of the fact that her child, Randa, was currently aboard a Yuuzhan Vong ship, deep in occupied territory at Kalarba. Borga was unfazed; she reiterated her earlier order to Bombaasa, and told him to make contact with Talon Karrde with some information unearthed by her child. Aboard the Yuuzhan Vong ship, Randa had discerned that the Yuuzhan Vong were also keeping a Jedi, Wurth Skidder, captive.

The Yuuzhan Vong conquered Hutt Space and terraformed Nal Hutta. Without an employer, Bombaasa eventually turned to Talon Karrde and joined his resurgent Smugglers' Alliance, which was serving almost as an extension of the newly-formed Galactic Alliance Defense Fleet.

The New Republic hoped to use a portion of their fleet to attack Coruscant while the majority of the enemy forces were in the Calamari system. A ground team consisting of Leia Organa Solo and Han Solo, as well as Alliance operatives Judder Page, Kyp Durron, Meloque and Graw was sent to disable the yammosk war coordinator on Caluula, a piece of biotechnology vital to the Yuuzhan Vong's war effort. Han Solo had Karrde, Bombaasa, Lando Calrissian, and Booster and Mirax Terrik dispatched in Booster's Star Destroyer Errant Venture to rid the system of any Yuuzhan Vong forces while the team was on the ground. The Star Destroyer's crew was surprised to find, upon entering the system, the area almost entirely devoid of any Yuuzhan Vong presence, despite Caluula housing a vital yammosk war coordinator.
