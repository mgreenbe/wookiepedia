In that position, the Wookiee worked alongside a free-agent ARC trooper known as Muzzle and another Wookiee, a bounty hunter named Snoova. Some time before 0 ABY, a Sullustan executive hired Aurodium Sword's services.

Pe\u00f1a and Ryan Kaufman, was published as part of Star Wars Insider 89 in August 2006. The text does not mention the character by name, nor does it provide the mercenary's gender. The idea for the character came from Ryan Kaufman's five-year-old son, Max, who liked to team up a clone commander action figure with three toy Wookiees. Kaufman found the idea of a clone backed up by Wookiees to be attractive, so he adopted that configuration for the Aurodium Sword organization."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
