This was known to be a communication error, where the Guarlara's command crews mistook the report and thought the Chancellor was already rescued and evacuated from the Invisible Hand."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
