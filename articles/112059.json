The material hit hardest was doonium, the white-gray metal used for hull plating that gave many capital ships their characteristic coloration, but other materials, such as hybrid plexisteel, also became scarce. The shortage was a result of increased demand from the Imperial government, Rebel attacks on production centers, and a pre-existing downward trend in Mid Rim production capability."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The shortage lasted for nearly a year, and led to a recession in the Core Worlds. This recession resulted in political ramifications for worlds in the Core, such as on Esseles, where the Forad Party lost its grip on the Esselian Hall for the first time in a decade. The shortage also lead to smuggling, including a major operation discovered by Imperial Customs on Brentaal. Furthermore, the shortage resulted in creative use of alternate materials for warship construction, most notably the armoring of one hundred Victory-class Star Destroyers with red havod-alloy plates."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Background"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The raw materials shortage had its origins in several areas. The Mid Rim of the galaxy was a region that was more impoverished than locations further coreward, lacking much in the way of natural resources or dense populations. For decades prior to the Battle of Yavin, the Mid Rim had seen a gradual slide in its raw materials productivity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, as the Galactic Civil War heated up, the Galactic Empire greatly expanded its military. The Empire facilitated this by eliminating legal roadblocks to the build-up, employing slave labor, and strip-mining entire worlds for resources to use in its militarization. By 1 ABY, Imperial orders for raw materials had begun to significantly impinge on orders from the private sector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Finally, following the destruction of the first Death Star, the Alliance to Restore the Republic's propaganda network found purchase in locations it never had before; even the most remote settlement had soon learned of the Empire's defeat. This greatly accelerated the Alliance's efforts to foment armed resistance, with entire worlds openly defying the Empire. The Rebellion now had the wherewithal to conduct numerous waves of quick, surgically-precise hit-and-fade attacks against Imperial forces. Among the Rebels' targets were key raw materials production sites."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The \"rawmat\" shortage"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 1 ABY, these factors came to a head in a critical shortage of raw materials, a shortage especially pronounced in the Core Worlds and Mid Rim. The metal doonium, a white-gray metal used to plate the hulls of capital ships, such as Star Destroyers, became particularly scarce. Other strategic materials, however, such as hybrid plexisteel were also in short supply."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Cynabar's scoop"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of the first news outlets to pick up on the shortage of raw materials\u2014colloquially known as rawmat\u2014was Cynabar's InfoNet. On 36:6:26 GrS, their article \"Mid-Rim Experiencing RawMat Shortage\" reported that industry experts in their circle of informants believed that these raw materials were becoming scarce, and that, in particular, raw materials purchasers were acquiring every shipment of doonium possible. Cynabar's experts cited the increase in Imperial demand, the crippling of production facilities by Rebel partisans, and the long-term downward trend in Mid Rim production for the scarcity. Cynabar's InfoNet learned that, while a majority of Imperial rawmat transports were normal charters bound for well-known shipyards such as Kuat and Tallaan, a significant number were military vessels under the aegis of the Imperial Energy Systems subministry. These ships were traveling to undisclosed locations, which the article speculated might be located in the Core. The report concluded with an advisory to free-traders with access to scarce raw materials to stockpile them, as the NewsNet anticipated them selling for double the price within the following fiscal quarter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Less than a month after the publication of \"Mid-Rim Experiencing RawMat Shortage,\" the Empire began a heated search for the creators of Cynabar's InfoNet on Nar Shaddaa."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Core Worlds recession and political ramifications"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The shortage of raw materials led to skyrocketing prices for manufactured goods within the Core Worlds and Mid Rim. Four months after news of the shortage first broke, it was having a significant effect on the economy of the Core Worlds, leading them into a recession. The stumbling economy led to political repercussions on planets such as Esseles. Esseles had long had a political sphere dominated by its President, former Clone Wars hero Cambira Ralle, and his Forad Party. However, as the planetary economy faltered with the rest of the Core, the Esselian New Order Party's leader, Jamson Freller, capitalized on the fact. He attacked Ralle's policy of allowing non-Humans to be employed in strategic manufacturing jobs on the world. This attack made substantial inroads against the Forad Party's coalition government with the Cardean Party, as well as against Forad itself. In the Esselian Hall election held during the New Year Fete Week of 2 ABY, Forad lost its holding of the majority of the Esselian Hall for the first time in two decades, with Freller's ENO party making substantial gains, allowing him to call for a new Presidential election. Within a month, terrorist attacks by the anti-Imperial group known as the Faceless at Grande Hyet and Tralee had further stirred up the political situation on Esseles, leading to a strike by the Guild of Offworld Skilled Laborers and an exodus of aliens from the world."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Smuggling"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the second month of the year, the Outer Rim Territories itself was experiencing a shortage of raw materials great enough that, when a rawmat smuggling operation on Brentaal was uncovered by Imperial Customs, the lead investigating officer's first suspicion was that the materials were headed for secondary sources in that region. Customs raided an uninhabited warehouse in the Votrad sector of Brentaal's starport, locating thousands of tons of missing raw materials. Back-tracing the registry and lot numbers on the goods led investigators to misdirected shipments from mining and corporate transport vessels, which the traffickers rerouted into the warehouse by slicing into corporate and Customs computer systems."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Red ships"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, the shortage had impacted military production, as well. At Kuat Drive Yards in the Kuat system, one hundred venerable Victory-class Star Destroyers, which had entered the yards in 0 BBY and had been due to be completed at the end of 1 ABY, sat unfinished. The doonium hull plates which had been allocated for these ships were redirected to more modern Star Destroyers in other parts of the shipyard, and the Victory-class ships idled for nearly five months awaiting new plating, despite already having fully refurbished engines, weapons, shields, and hangars. Rather than allow these ships to remain unusable in dock, Imperial Admiral Kendel ordered havod metal alloy plates for these ships in the fourth month of 2 ABY. Havod, a reddish alloy that met all military specifications, was normally too difficult to process for such applications, but Kendel deemed it necessary in order to clear the docks for other projects."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The decision to plate Victory-class Star Destroyers with havod alloy plating was poorly received by both crews and the public. Admiral Kendel's office was flooded by transfer requests from individuals who had otherwise been eager to serve aboard these refurbished ships, and the Historical Battleship Preservation Association indicated its distaste for the move through member Harod Crimmler, who stated \"It would be a shame to see the classical appearance of the Victory-class destroyer marred by red hull plating.\""}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Conclusion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ultimately, the shortage of raw materials diminished, as the high prices for finished goods led investors and mining concerns to rush open new mines to meet the demand. Admiral Kendel's spokeswoman indicated that Kuat Drive Yards would be receiving regular doonium shipments from newly-opened sources in the Outer Rim in the third fiscal quarter of 2 ABY, forestalling the need for further havod refining, and Rally's Daily Investor estimated 9,000 new system-wide mining facilities would enter full production during that time."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The recession in the Core Worlds caused by the shortage soon abated, and within a year, some economic indicators were reaching record highs. On 38:4:21 GrS, the Brentaal League of Guilds declared a Landmark Holiday, celebrating the fact that more stocks and credits were exchanged during the prior five-day period than at any time in history. Industry throughout the Core Worlds was boosted by the extensive trading, with such corporations as HavaKing, Santhe/Sienar Technologies, MerenData, the Imperial Mining Corporation, and the Tagge Company all posting record profits and dividend increases."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite the poor reception red-hulled Victory-class vessels received when announced, their havod plating was military grade and up to the tasks the Imperial Navy had for them. A decade after Kendel issued his unorthodox order, seventy-three Victory-class Star Destroyers with red-alloy hulls were still in use in the Crimson Command of High Admiral Treuten Teradoc, a breakaway Imperial warlord. The flotilla was under the command of Rear Admiral Gilad Pellaeon, who would later go on to become the leader of the Imperial Remnant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The opening of thousands of new mines in isolated parts of the Outer Rim provided independent tramp freighter captains with opportunities to service the miners and support staffs located there. With the sudden explosion of new mines, most corporations had not established company stores, meaning independent traders could sell directly to their employees.
