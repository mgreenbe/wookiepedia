Although Fort Tusken was considered to be part of the Jundland Wastes, at least a part of the fortress existed within this region. The Tusken relic cave was also situated a relatively close distance away from the Tusken March. Largely inhabited by the planet's native Sand People, the region also contained other curiosities, such as graveyards, the skeletal remains of at least one krayt dragon, ruins, and other scattered remnants of habitation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Tusken March first appeared as a designated planetary region in the 2003 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, prior to the game's closure on December 15, 2011."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
