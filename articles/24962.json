Many individuals died in the arena, including Kreel's father, mother, and many of his acquaintances. Kreel himself survived once stormtroopers of the Galactic Empire's 501st Legion arrived on Chagar IX. The Empire toppled the overlords of the pits in a day, and went on to close the arenas down and give jobs to the population. Kreel ultimately joined the Imperial Academy and the Stormtrooper Corps."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
