The frigate was capable of atmospheric entry and could carry multiple speeder bike squads in its forward upper assault deck, unleashing them onto the battlefield upon landing. The aerial vehicle deck was above the central axis of the vessel, while a second assault deck was placed below, with a platform door lowering to deploy ground troops."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "One of these frigates deployed Revanchist Jedi Knights onto Essien to battle Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders who had taken the planet weeks before."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
