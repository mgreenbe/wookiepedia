They were black in appearance with a hard, chitinous shell that allowed them to blend well into the darkness of their homeworld's forests. They would stun or disable prey with their segmented tails, and, once the prey was vulnerable, the scarpyen would then use its claws to grasp the food and inject a powerful venom into it, using its dagger-like stinger."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
