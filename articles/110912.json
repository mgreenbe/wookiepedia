The operation was conducted by a force from Lourna Dee's Tempest, led by the Cloud Ultident Margrona. However, unbeknownst to Dee or her subordinates, Eye of the Nihil Marchion Ro had approved the raid with the intent of capturing a Jedi, as the Jedi Order had an outpost on Elphrona. To that end, Ro secretly tipped off the outpost after the raid had begun, leading the four Jedi stationed there to come to the Blythes' rescue. Three of the four kidnapped individuals were rescued before their abductors could get far from the system, with all of the members of Margrona's original team killed. However, Jedi Master Loden Greatstorm was captured after he sustained a broken leg attempting to rescue Ottoh Blythe from Margrona's Cloudship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
