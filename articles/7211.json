Like all Trianii colonies Fibuli was an independent, self-sustaining community, but the famed Trianii Rangers served as an independent security force to protect the planet. Peace faltered, however, in the face of growing expansion by the Corporate Sector Authority (CSA), which began to claim territory dangerously near Trianii space. When the CSA claimed Fibuli in 2 BBY, they expected the Trianii to retreat to their other worlds. Instead, the Trianii offered resistance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The campaign"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Security Police were not accustomed to open warfare, but nonetheless the conquest of Fibuli lasted a mere three months. This was expedited by the brutality of Security Police interrogators, who ruthlessly tortured captured Trianii for information on the whereabouts of the leaders of the Trianii resistance. Their torture methods included The Burning, where flesh was scorched off the bone of living prisoners. Many Trianii Rangers fought against the Security Police, including Atuarre and her mate Keeheen, but in the end Fibuli fell. Atuarre escaped, but her mate and her cub Pakka were captured. She managed to rescue Pakka on her own, but the tortures he had suffered traumatized him, and he refused to speak. Keeheen was shipped to the Corporate Sector Authority prison at Stars' End."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the annexation of Fibuli was a victory for the Corporate Sector Authority, the Trianii saw the campaign as an act of war.
