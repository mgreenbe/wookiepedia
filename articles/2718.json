They discover the remains of three old Rodian starships inside one of the caves. Greedo returns to his hut and asks his mother, Neela, about the ships.

Greedo, hoping to establish some connections within the bounty-hunting community, shoots Gorm in the back, disabling him. Spurch is grateful for the assistance and decides to take Greedo under his wing.

He learns that the Rebel Alliance maintains a secret munitions warehouse on Level 88. He sells the information to Spurch, who in turn sells it to the Empire. With the money he receives, Greedo prepares to acquire his own starship. He goes to Shug Ninx's repair shop where he finds an Incom Corsair that would be perfect for him. He even has a name for it\u2014the Manka Hunter. The ship needs a couple of power couplings, however, so he tries to steal some from a YT-1300 light freighter stored at the garage. The freighter's owners, Han Solo and Chewbacca, catch him in the act and interrogate him. Han decides to let Greedo keep the couplings in exchange for his rancor-skin coat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before long, Darth Vader uses the information he has received and sends two Gamma-class assault shuttles to Nar Shaddaa to destroy the Rebel storage facilities.
