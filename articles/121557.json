Following Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala's discovery of the droid factories, the Jedi High Council dispatched a massive Jedi-led detachment of the Grand Army of the Republic to retake Geonosis and halt the facilities' production of battle droids. Tasked with the challenge of landing on the planet and establishing a staging area, the Jedi mounted a three-pronged attack on the Geonosian defenses in what became known as the battle of Point Rain, with Jedi Generals Ki-Adi-Mundi, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Anakin Skywalker each leading an assault force. After establishing a landing zone at Point Rain, a site close to the factories' Ray Shield Fortress generator, the Republic army regrouped and disabled the factories' ray shield, making way for the rest of the clone trooper forces to safely land."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Poggle attempted to retake Point Rain and his Ray Shield Fortress, his main droid foundry was targeted by the Jedi.

As their Masters battled Poggle's army\u2014including several newly designed super tanks\u2014on the bridge leading to the factory, the Padawans' infiltration of the foundry was cut short when they were intercepted by Poggle and his tactical droid, TX-21. With their explosive charges stolen, Tano and Offee used a super tank to blow up the facility's reactor and collapse the factory from the inside.

Tracking Unduli's last known location, Kenobi and Skywalker set out with a clone platoon to rescue her. Battling hordes of \"undead\" Geonosian warriors who were being reanimated by the queen's brain worm parasites, the Jedi and their troops found Unduli in Karina's lair. Although Karina wished to induct Unduli and her comrades into her ranks of mind-controlled warriors, Kenobi, Skywalker, and their men were able to save Unduli and take Poggle into custody.

Because the Galactic Republic had captured the planet at the war's outset, the facilities were kept secret to protect them from the Republic, which greatly underestimated the Geonosians' resistance and their loyalty to the Separatists. Archduke Poggle the Lesser himself oversaw the foundries' progress, particularly the rebuilding of the primary droid foundry, which was intended to surpass in size the original factories that had fallen during the First Battle of Geonosis. Poggle himself had been humiliated during the First Battle of Geonosis and viewed the factory as his redemption, and he also hoped to exact his revenge on the Republic for the occupation of his planet and the destruction of many of his factories."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Poggle's factories churned out thousands of battle droids a day, and the units were sold to the Confederacy for its war machine. The InterGalactic Banking Clan invested substantial funds in the primary foundry, but after the financial burden became too big to bear, the Banking Clan took on another Separatist-loyal corporation, the Trade Federation, as a co-investor. As Republic Senator Lott Dod of the Trade Federation and Senator Rush Clovis of the Banking Clan delegation prepared to meet on Cato Neimoidia, where Dod resided, to discuss their investments in the foundry, the Jedi High Council\u2014correctly suspecting Clovis of involvement in a Separatist conspiracy\u2014recruited Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala to spy on Clovis.

At Dod's palace, Clovis met in secret with Dod and Poggle the Lesser, who had also arrived to participate in the deliberations. Dod and Poggle both attempted to negotiate for greater shares in the investment, but Clovis refused to change the terms of the agreement. However, Dod, witnessing Clovis's affection for Amidala, secretly poisoned the latter with a dose of lethal manax-root poison to force the Banking Clan senator to change his mind. Shortly after stealing a disc containing the droid foundry's tactical coordinates from a hologram projector in the palace's library, Amidala fainted from the effects of the poison. Clovis threatened Dod with a blaster and secured the antidote to the poison, which he gave to Skywalker. Accordingly, Skywalker helped Amidala to her J-type star skiff and administered the medicine, then departed from Cato Neimoidia with Amidala and the disc.

Upon arrival in orbit of the world, Rex and his men were unable to establish contact with the clone troopers on the planet's surface but confirmed from preliminary scans that droid foundries, some of them close to completion and others already operational, were being constructed in the world's northern and southern hemispheres. Rex sent his report back to the Jedi Temple with the advisement that a full-scale invasion would be necessary to retake Geonosis. Reviewing the report, the Jedi Council decided to send Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Ki-Adi-Mundi and Senior Jedi General Luminara Unduli to lead the Grand Army's attack on the droid foundries. Since the facilities were a significant threat to the Republic's safety, retaking Geonosis would be essential to the Republic war effort. Generals Plo Koon and Skywalker, Admiral Wullf Yularen, and Skywalker's Padawan, Commander Ahsoka Tano, were meanwhile assigned to reinforce the planet Dorin, which had been attacked by a Separatist fleet led by the Confederate General Grievous in an effort to keep the Jedi's attention away from Geonosis."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Republic forces spent much time in preparation for the assault on Geonosis.

The elite gunship battled through enemy droid forces\u2014including DSD1 dwarf spider droids, Multi-Troop Transports, jetpack-equipped B2-RP battle droids, Vulture droid starfighters, Hyena-class bombers, and droid tri-fighters\u2014before reaching and destroying the Geonosian communications facility. Elsewhere, while overseeing the battle against the Geonosians in the area alongside Skywalker and Tano, Rex contacted Cody to request reinforcements for Skywalker but found that Kenobi would be unable to give support, as Kenobi's gunship had been shot down. Left on their own, Skywalker and Tano provided cover for Rex and the rest of their troops to rush the Separatist blaster cannons. At Point Rain, meanwhile, Cody organized his LAAT/i gunships and AT-TE walkers in a circular defensive formation.

With the wall destroyed, Skywalker, Tano, and their forces pressed toward Point Rain. Meanwhile, Mundi split up his own troops, sending his AT-TE walkers to take a longer route to the rendezvous point, while he took a squad to examine a shortcut through a clifftop cave. There, Mundi and his men were besieged by groups of winged Geonosian warriors who depleted the clones' numbers by attacking them and carrying them into the grotto's depths.

It was decided that Skywalker would lead a small squad into the shield and jam the Geonosians' scanners, rendering them unable to target the incoming AT-TE walkers. Once the walkers had taken out the shield generator, Mundi would then bring in the rest of the troops with the gunships. With little time to spare, the Republic forces quickly moved into position; after everything was ready, Skywalker and Tano initiated their attack, charging through the shield with their men.

As the Geonosians began to march on their position, Breaker had the Republic's engineers prepare some blaster turret defense platforms to hold the line. The Republic forces used their blaster turrets to great effect in eliminating the deployed Separatist forces, which included ranks of BX-series droid commandos, droid-piloted Single Trooper Aerial Platforms, and IG-227 Hailfire-class droid tanks.

Elsewhere, Republic troops made significant progress; Skywalker's forces closed in on Poggle's primary droid foundry and began preparations for their assault.

Unwilling to let the Separatists overrun the fortress and subsequently break the Republic's supply lines, Breaker and the Jedi Knight mobilized their forces to defend the facility. Beginning their assault on the Ray Shield Fortress, Poggle and TX-21 dispatched a large wave of droid forces and NR-N99 Persuader-class droid enforcers to recapture the facility, and the Republic forces retaliated with a number of blaster turret emplacements.

Leading the way in their gunship, Unduli, Offee, and Clone Commander CC-1004, nicknamed \"Gree,\" arrived at the Republic's staging area with more troops and gunships, and Unduli and Offee met with Skywalker and Tano to finalize a plan for the impending attack on the droid foundry. Although Skywalker had been preparing for a direct assault on the factory via the bridge, Unduli proposed an alternative plan that would minimize their casualties: using the catacombs under the facility, a team could infiltrate the building and plant explosives at its main reactor, thus effectively destroying the foundry from the inside. As Unduli had already had her Padawan memorize all 200 of the labyrinth's internal junctions, the mission to infiltrate the droid factory fell to Tano and Offee.

The Jedi and clones opened fire on their adversaries but were unable to stop the insectoids. With his men outnumbered and taking losses, Kenobi ordered the platoon to take out the tunnel's supports and retreat, seeing it as the only way to halt the Geonosians' advance. The Jedi and their troops escaped from the zombie warriors for the time being. Kenobi and Skywalker grimly noted the drone warriors' apparent immunity to all of their attacks and resolved to request reinforcements from Mundi. Because they were too deep underground to get a comlink signal, Kenobi sent trooper Gearshift and another clone to backtrack to the surface and contact Mundi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two troopers did not get far before being attacked and killed by the Geonosian zombies. Hearing the pair's screams, Kenobi, Skywalker, Cody, and the rest of the platoon ran to help their comrades but arrived too late to save them, instead finding their slain bodies. Although Skywalker wanted to go to the surface himself to hail Mundi, Kenobi believed that they could not divide their troops again and noted that time was running out for Unduli. The captive Unduli, meanwhile, woke up to find herself suspended in a containment field next to the throne of Queen Karina the Great, who was in the process of reproducing more Geonosian drones from her undulating and large egg sac, aided to by the reanimated warriors of her hive. Kenobi, Skywalker, and Cody finally found the royal chamber and spied on the proceedings from the shadows. Using his infrared headlamp in the dark room, Cody located Unduli next to the throne and Poggle in conversation with the Queen. Skywalker was set to mount a full-on attack on the Geonosians, but Kenobi, who was after the reasons behind the queen's abduction of Unduli, devised a different plan. The Jedi set up their clone troopers around the room's perimeter, intending to have their men use their headlamps to temporarily blind the dark-dwelling Geonosians and create enough confusion so that they could rescue Unduli when the appropriate moment presented itself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Cody stealthily moved the men into place, Kenobi and Skywalker marched straight into the throne room and through the lines of Geonosians zombies to speak with Karina. Kenobi spoke with the queen and told her that her rule was at an end, but the shrieking queen refused to recognize the Jedi's authority. Her subordinates took the Jedi's lightsabers from them, and Karina then revealed her intentions: instead of seeking the Jedi's elimination, she wished to possess them using her brain worms, as the Jedi would make valuable additions to her army of warriors. As Poggle placed one of the parasites on Unduli so that the worms' power could be demonstrated, Kenobi signaled Cody and the clones to attack. The troopers blasted their headlamps on the Geonosians and temporarily blinded them, allowing Kenobi and Skywalker to retrieve their lightsabers from the drones with the Force. While Kenobi himself took Unduli's brain worm as a sample for study, Skywalker freed Unduli and returned her lightsaber to her."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi confronted Poggle, and Skywalker shackled the Geonosian archduke in a pair of binders and brought him along with them before knocking Kenobi's worm sample out of his hand and crushing it beneath his boot. Once Kenobi, Skywalker, and Unduli had fled the cave with the detained Poggle, the clone troopers provided cover for them and blasted the chamber's supports, trapping the Geonosians there under layers of rubble and killing Queen Karina the Great. The warrior drones continued to follow the group, and as the clones continued to focus their fire at their pursuers, the Jedi headed to escape the catacombs to the surface. The Republic platoon climbed an air shaft out of the caverns, and the Geonosians pursing the squad were knocked back down and crushed under falling rocks. A geyser of dust billowed through the vertical passage and spewed Kenobi, Skywalker, Unduli, Poggle, Cody, and the remaining clone troopers out of the catacombs. The group evacuated the temple shortly before it collapsed. With the ordeal over and Archduke Poggle the Lesser in Republic custody, the Jedi hoped that the queen's deadly brain worms had been buried with her under the temple, though that was not the case."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Aftermath"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The assault on Geonosis finally resulted in success, and the Republic was able to recapture the Separatist-allied world, ensuring that its droid factories would no longer fortify the Confederacy's troop lines. The Jedi's encounter with the Geonosian zombies prompted the Galactic Senate and Coruscant Health Administration to issue a warning to the citizens of the Republic concerning the supposed \"mystery infection\" that was plaguing the Geonosians, urging caution for all inter-planetary travel. While the Jedi ushered the captured Poggle onto a Nu-class attack shuttle at a landing area in preparation to take him to Coruscant for trial, Mundi received word that Mace Windu's defenses on the planet Dantooine had been able to hold out, albeit at a great cost to his men; Windu immediately required medical supplies that were waiting to be delivered from a medical station near the planet Ord Cestus. However, Skywalker and Unduli believed that it was also of immediate importance to transport Poggle to Coruscant, as the Republic had to begin debriefing him if any useful Separatist intelligence was to be gained from him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In order to allow himself and the other Jedi Generals to continue with the impending task of transporting Poggle to Coruscant, Skywalker proposed that Tano and Offee handle the medical supply mission, and the other Jedi Generals agreed. Kenobi assigned the Padawans to take a medical frigate to the medcenter, planning to rendezvous with them alongside Mundi, Unduli, and Skywalker for the voyage to Dantooine after delivering Poggle to Coruscant. After Tano and Offee departed for the Ord Cestus facility with the Pelta-class frigate TB-73 and clone troopers of Tango Company as their embarked troops, the four Jedi Generals and Captain Rex left with Poggle under heavy guard aboard a Venator-class Star Destroyer, bound for Coruscant. The Padawans' routine mission, however, suddenly became a dire fight for survival when Geonosian brain worms\u2014having infected Tango Company trooper CT-9544, nicknamed \"Scythe,\" at the remains of the Progate Temple\u2014attempted to take control of their supply ship."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Second Battle of Geonosis was the first major battle of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series' 2009 second season, following the Battle of Ryloth featured in the first season. It marked the Jedi's return to Geonosis after the First Battle of Geonosis and was featured across three chapters of a five-part story arc in the season\u2014\"Landing at Point Rain,\" \"Weapons Factory,\" and \"Legacy of Terror,\" which began airing on November 4, 2009 and continued until November 20. The three episodes were followed by the conclusion of the saga, \"Brain Invaders,\" and were preceded by the episode \"Senate Spy,\" which led into the battle by detailing the Republic's discovery of the droid foundries. In December 2010, the battle received its very own mini-game, entitled the \"Geonosis Saga,\" as part of the Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures video game. Besides expanding upon various aspects of the campaign, the game clarified the canonical significance of Point Rain as the Republic's landing zone, which was not established in \"Landing at Point Rain\" despite the allusion to it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The battle's span over several television episodes allowed for various pre-existing characters to be introduced into the television series, notably Jedi Master Ki-Adi-Mundi, Jedi Padawan Barriss Offee, and Geonosian Archduke Poggle the Lesser. \"Landing at Point Rain,\" the first chapter in the story arc, was added within the second season's production schedule at Series Producer George Lucas's request for the conflict to begin with a D-day attack storyline plot, with inspiration from World War II. \"Landing at Point Rain\" itself was used to look at the Jedi's challenges from the war with injuries on the parts of Mundi and Obi-Wan Kenobi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Overall, the battle was meant to recall the visual sense from classic war films such as The Longest Day, Blackhawk Down, and Saving Private Ryan. The battle represented a major milestone for the television series, from showcasing the visual scale and detail that the series' production team was able to reach in modeling Season Two's animation, to representing the depth and variety that the series' writing team was able to achieve in the story arc's individual yet cohesive plot lines. As of the Spring 2011 conclusion to the television series' third season, the Second Battle of Geonosis has been named by Star Wars Insider as one of the largest engagements seen in the series, with the others being the Battle of Christophsis, the Battle of Ryloth, and the Battle of Kamino."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several aspects of the battle, including the destruction of the super tanks, were modified before the battle's storyline reached its final version. In \"Weapons Factory,\" Anakin Skywalker and Luminara Unduli were to originally place their thermal detonators directly on the super tanks to destroy them, but at Lucas's instruction, they instead placed their explosive charges under the bridge that the tanks were crossing, thereby eliminating them by compromising the pass."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Inconsistencies"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Although the \"Daily Trivia\" mini-game of the Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures video game, as well as The Official Star Wars Fact File Part 24, stated that the portion of the battle featured in \"Legacy of Terror\" was a separate conflict, this was not supported by the television series, which did not provide any further division for the battle. In fact, the Star Wars: The Clone Wars Character Encyclopedia maintained that the \"Legacy of Terror\" portion was part of the battle. This article therefore follows the television series' interpretation of events. In addition, there were initially some problems with the battle's official name, with a preview article for the episode \"Brain Invaders\" published on StarWars.com introducing difficulties with the naming of the battle. The article in question referred to the battle as the \"Battle of Geonosis,\" a title that had already been adopted for the opening battle of the Clone Wars. Another article later published on StarWars.com resolved the conflict, officially giving the battle the \"Second Battle of Geonosis\" name. The original Battle of Geonosis was later identified as the \"First Battle of Geonosis,\" making a clearer distinction between the two battles. Additionally, the \"battle of Point Rain\" name was provided in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars Comic UK 6.5 magazine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Second Battle of Geonosis was initially dated to 21 BBY in Star Wars Annual 2011, which was later overridden by The Official Star Wars Fact File Part 8, in which the event was moved to late 22 BBY.

During the frontal assault on Poggle the Lesser's primary droid foundry, the Jedi take a BARC speeder to cross the bridge to the foundry, and several cannons and enemy bases guarding the factory must be destroyed to ensure success. In the main versions of the game, Ahsoka Tano and Barriss Offee do not plant explosive charges at the factory's reactor; instead, they directly commandeer the super tank to destroy the facility's core. In the Nintendo DS edition of the game, Tano and Offee engage the factory's defenses on the way to the reactor. Once there, they are able to plant their explosive charges without interference from the Geonosians, and then they simply commandeer the super tank to complete their mission.
