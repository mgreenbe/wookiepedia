Developing repulsorlift technology and sublight drives to power their starships, the Kerestians colonized the nearby moons of Karoliston and Pharna and dispatched colony ships with colonists placed in suspended animation."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Far from the space lanes which cluttered the Sluis sector, the galactic population did not notice when Kerest's star saw a radical reduction in energy and sent Kerest into a perpetual ice age. While most of the native species died out, some colonies of Kerestians survived, though they devolved into a primitive race of barbarians and hunters. Loosing all connections to their former technology-savvy societies, the planet went unnoticed for some time before explorers from the House of Tagge stumbled upon the world. Sending ships down to survey the planet, the spacers noted the violent tendencies of the primitive natives and deemed the harsh environment ill-suited for future colonization."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While located in space controlled by the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars, the planet's natives were not known to have become involved in any galactic conflicts. When an ancient Kerestian colony-ship was discovered during the time of the Galactic Empire, the colonists aboard did not demonstrate any of the hostility noted in their counterparts living on their homeworld. Modern day researchers concluded that the it was indeed the shift in planetary temperatures which caused the species to adapt into their present form."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
