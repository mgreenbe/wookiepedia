The boy studied as a student in the Jedi Temple on the planet Coruscant, where he regularly sparred with training weapons against fellow youngling Caleb Dume. At one point, the Zeltron attended a lecture by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Temple's central security station. During the lecture Kenobi explained to the younglings present about the Jedi beacon, a signal which could call all Jedi across the galaxy back to Coruscant. Dume, who also attended the lecture, asked Kenobi a series of questions about the beacon, which the Zeltron boy later mocked him for in their next sparring session."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The youngling first appeared, but not named. in A New Dawn, a novel written by John Jackson Miller and published in 2014. The boy's species was not identified in the book, as Miller wanted to demonstrate how cosmopolitan the Star Wars galaxy was by not having the species of others even cross the mind of point of view characters. The author later posted the novel's production notes on his blog, which revealed the boy was a Zeltron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
