The planet was the home of Bertroff Hissa, a Human-Sephi hybrid who ended up becoming Grand Moff of the Galactic Empire. PL-40112-CE-021105 remained uncharted until the Empire launched a survey. However, the surveyors awoke an ancient horde of Rozzum, a species of inter-dimensional monsters. The Imperials were forced to ally with the Near-Humans who lived on PL-40112-CE-021105 in order to vanquish the creatures. Ultimately, only two survived the encounter: Hissa, and the ranking Imperial officer from Naboo, Commander Quarsh Panaka."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
