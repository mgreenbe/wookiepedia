When Baras found out that his sister was imprisoned there, he decided to organize a rescue attempt. Timmns eventually learned about this and returned to Belsavis to prevent the Imperial troops from rescuing Ekkage from her prison. He fought against Lord Melicoste, who was hired by Baras to rescue Ekkage, but Melicoste was able to find the location of Ekkage and lock Timmns in the archive room. As the door was sealed and secured by a force field, Timmns could not break free."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Baras' former apprentice, the Emperor's Wrath, also received an order to prevent Ekkage's liberation from Servant One and was retracing the steps of Melicoste, eventually finding Timmns in the locked room. Since both had the same goal, Timmns proposed to work together, even though he recognized the Sith Warrior who destroyed his master. Timmns didn't trust the Wrath, but they were forced to work together to leave the prison and prevent Ekkage's release. Timmns knew that they could only prevent a common liberation. To save time, they split paths: while Timmns was on his way to Ekkage's cell block in the Deep Prison, the Wrath stopped the Sith infiltrators who were in another cell block just before they were liberated. Shortly after the Wrath neutralized the threat, Timmns contacted him again. Timmns explained that had found a way into Ekkage's cell block, but it was broken down behind him. The Wrath had to come up an alternative way, and so the Wrath transmitted to Timmns the coordinates of their final meeting place. Timmns was able to call Ekkage's cell number and promised he would survive. He finally made it to the cell, just as anger turned against Ekkage who had been freed by Melicoste. Along with the Wrath, Timmns engaged the Sith, and defeat he in fair combat. However, after the Wrath killed her, Timmns was disappointed of killing an unarmed opponent. The Wrath couldn't be friends with the Jedi and engaged him in duel. Somminick tried his best to defeat the Wrath, but was killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Powers and abilities"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Timmns displayed great lightsaber fighting abilities being able to fight two Sith Lords, one being a former member of the powerful Dark Council, and survive.

If dark sided, Jaesa replies she has no regrets, especially when she gets to \"meet and kill obnoxious fools like [Timmns].\" Timmns sarcastically replies that she and the Wrath deserve each other. If light-sided, after Timmns has recognized her \"serene and tempered presence,\" Jaesa will say that she doesn't regret joining the Warrior most of the time; she believes that everyone has a \"great capacity to change.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After defeating Darth Ekkage, the player has the option to kill her for dark alignment points or put her back into her cell for light alignment points. As a compromise, Timmns seals the controls so she can never be let out again.

In the case of the latter, they can reassert their status as his enemy, or assure him they have a common goal and that when the War is over, they can be friends.
