At some point the first brother and second brother trained five aliens including the exiled Wookiee Black Krrsantan against his will and forced him to fight gladiatorial in fighting pits. Sometime after the Battle of Yavin, the Xonti Brothers attended an auction led by Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra. Black Krrsantan saw them and attempted to attack them, but Aphra had him stunned. When Aphra decided on her offer, Eternal Rur was released behind her back by 0-0-0 to blackmail her into releasing him from his programmed leash. The Xonti Brothers attempted to escape, only to be captured and taken away by Black Krrsantan.
