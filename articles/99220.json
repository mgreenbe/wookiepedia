The emitter barrel had all of the controls mounted onto it which included the activator, blade length and intensity control, and blade power adjust, as well as the weapon's radiator grooves. This was separated from the body of the weapon by a cut-back portion which also held the internal adegan crystal. Immediately below was the main body with a ridged handgrip, which thickened near the bottom of the section where the charging port was, concealed by the belt clip. The pommel was a black sphere and housed the power cell reserve cap which had six evenly spaced protrusions around the pommel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Obi-Wan Kenobi created the lightsaber during his time as a Padawan learner and modeled it after Qui-Gon's weapon as a mark of respect. It was at his side during the Invasion of Naboo, and Kenobi used it to defend himself from several battle droids on the Saak'ak before being overwhelmed by droidekas.

In Theed, Jinn and Kenobi were confronted by the Sith Lord Darth Maul, who killed the elder Jedi in the duel and forced the younger into a generator shaft with only a power node as a hand-hold. Although the Padawan's lightsaber was kicked down into the endless abyss, Kenobi was able to use his fallen master's weapon to defeat his opponent."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 28 BBY, Obi-Wan would later build a second lightsaber almost identical to the original weapon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
