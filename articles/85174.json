It contained a complete targeting and sensor system that had the ability to independently locate and destroy capital ships in orbit. Han and Leia Solo tried to sell this piece of artillery to the Killik nest Lizil as an attempt to get to the front lines of the Swarm War at Tenupe. When Lizil would not purchase it, they attempted to sell it to the Squibs. When this too failed, they sold the Magcannon to a group of pirates."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
