After the Battle of Endor, Myhr Rho, an enterprising Cathar, began a daily tour to the locations listed below. The Skywalker Tour became much more successful as word of the Empire's defeat at Endor spread, and the tour was able to upgrade the mode of transportation to that of a sail barge. However, evidence suggests that at some point between 4 ABY and 8 ABY the tours either stopped visiting certain locations or ended altogether."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The Tour"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This is a list of the places that the Skywalker Tour made stops at and the order in which they were visited by the tour."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Jabba's Palace and The Great Pit of Carkoon"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to the places listed above, the Skywalker Tour visited Jabba the Hutt's former palace and the Great Pit of Carkoon. Not much is known about the renovations to the palace, other than the fact that it boasted an accurate replica of the infamous piece of art Man in Carbonite. The difficulty with which it took Luke Skywalker and Han Solo to enter the former palace in the year 12 ABY suggests that the B'omarr Monks who inhabited it disliked the tourists and sealed off all of the entrances."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The stop at the Great Pit of Carkoon featured the gutted remains of Jabba the Hutt's sail barge, robots depicting Jabba and his minions, and the Sarlacc. It is likely that some cautionary measures were taken so as to prevent tourists from tumbling down the pit."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
