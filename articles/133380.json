Within the annual, there are many Holcoron datafiles which look at starships and technology in Star wars. The starship or the piece of technology is looked at well, complete with a detailed fact file and a picture and caption. Also, below the facts, there is a grid with that starship or piece of technology in. The reader can then use the grid to draw their own version of the ship in a grid adjacent. Using the grid, can create a very good duplicate. The puzzles and creative activities also follow starships and technology as well. All six Star wars films are told in detail as a photo story."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
