Serving as the master of Cere Junda during her years as a Padawan, Cordova became obsessed with the Zeffo after first encountering the ruins of one of their temples on the planet Ontotho. Sometime during the Clone Wars, while meditating inside an ancient vault on Bogano, Cordova was given a vision of the fall of the Jedi Order. To preserve the future of the Jedi, he hid a holocron containing the location of all Force-sensitive children within the Bogano Vault, and entrusted everything he had learned during his journeys to his droid, BD-1, hoping that Junda or some other Jedi would continue his mission if he should fail."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Jedi Master"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eno Cordova was trained by the Jedi Order in the ways of the Force, learning to wield it as an ally alongside his blue-bladed lightsaber. A student of ancient history and an explorer at heart, Cordova's service to the Order and the Republic led him across the galaxy to many worlds where he met many representatives of strange cultures and species. Among the contacts he made during his career was the Wookiee chieftain Tarfful of Kashyyyk. After attaining a reputation of a learned scholar, Cordova was granted the rank of Jedi Master and took Cere Junda as his Padawan."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "First encounter with the Zeffo"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point before the Clone Wars, the Jedi High Council sent Cordova and Junda to oversee the excavation of a temple on Ontotho.

Within the depths of the tomb, Cordova uncovered clues which led him to believe the Zeffo had once traveled to Kashyyyk. Armed with this knowledge, Cordova sought out his old friend Tarfful for wisdom surround this mystery."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While exploring an ancient Zeffo temple, Cordova received a vision of the fall of the Jedi Order and rushed back to Coruscant to warn the Jedi Council. None of the Council were convinced and disregarded his vision, with the only member of the Order who believed him being Jocasta Nu, his trusted confidante during his time at the Jedi Temple. Nu entered the Archives and created a copy of a holocron which listed all potential Force-sensitive children across the galaxy and gave it to Cordova to protect. Cordova hid the holocron in a Zeffo Vault on Bogano, a largely unexplored planet where it would be safe from the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cordova, sensing his life would soon come to an end, had his trusted companion droid BD-1 record video messages detailing his journeys across Bogano, Zeffo, Kashyyyk and Dathomir. Cordova hoped these holographic messages would guide a new Jedi to retrieve and unlock the holocron so that the Jedi Order could be rebuilt following the Great Jedi Purge. Cordova warned that, in order to prevent the messages from being accessed by the Empire, he would have to encrypt them, essentially meaning BD-1 would have to lose his memories in order to protect the information. The droid agreed, and Cordova parted ways with his trusted friend, sending BD to find the savior of the Jedi."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "BD-1 eventually encountered Cal Kestis, a Jedi Padawan who had survived Order 66 by hiding out as a scrapper on Bracca, when Cordova's Padawan Cere Junda took Cal to the Bogano Vault.
