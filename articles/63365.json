Aunt Z says that she knows but that she'd rather take her chances out there. She reasons that there is no chance for her to stay if she can't run her own cantina and walks off.

Torra then asks what they can do to help.

Aunt Z says that if Kragan can bring it back, he and his crew can eat free of charge. Kragan then says that unlike Doza he is not afraid to try. This infuriates Torra since Doza is her father. Kragan responds that this is the only \"smart thing\" that Captain Doza did since he left Castilon. Kragan and his gang walk away.

But Torra tells him that Kragan and his crew have already cut a deal with Aunt Z to hunt it down, which she suggests could be a way to undermine Doza's authority. This does not surprise Doza since Kragan is a pirate. Torra tells her father that she and Kaz will accompany the Warbirds to Celsor 3 to hunt down the jakoosk to show that Doza is still in command of the Colossus.

Kragan disagrees, calling it nonsense and says that before there were starships to prey upon, pirates hunted a vast array of creatures throughout the stars.

Kaz replies that technically is a plan. The Galleon dispatches several airspeeders out of its ventral hangar bay. Snarl is excited but Drell begins to wonder how big a jakoosk is.

At the suggestion of Snarl, the pirates begin to throw explosives down into order to lure the massive beast out of hiding. As the pirates gaze at the stormy skies below, a large shape glides below them, camouflaged by the clouds. Suddenly, the jakoosk charges at them with its jaws, scaring Snarl and Drell.

Kaz wonders what Kragan is doing. As Synara watches in horror, the jakoosk plows through Snarl and Drell's speeder, causing it to crash into the icy surface below. Synara tells a Nikto co-pilot and Kragan that Snarl and Drell are down and that they must retreat. Kragan refuses to retreat but Synara points out that he will cease to be a captain if he loses his ship.

Over the intercom, Kaz reassures Synara that he and Torra will deal with the creature. Kaz and Torra use their racers' laser cannons to fire at the creature's underbelly and claws, causing it to retreat to the surface.

Kaz and Torra realize that if they could get to the surface below the beast, then they could get a clear shot. Torra points out that they would need a good weapon to get it down.
