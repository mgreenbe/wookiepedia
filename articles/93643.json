It was the site of a battle between Republic clone troopers and Separatist droids during the Clone Wars. Sometime during the era of the Galactic Empire, the colony was declared to be a failure, and resources spent towards it were cut. Mrinzebon became overrun with criminal gangs and syndicates, though none were organized enough to take full control. After the death of Emperor Palpatine during the Battle of Endor, Mrinzebon was abandoned by the Empire, who retracted the garrison that they had stationed on the world. One of the garrison's members, Vryant, stayed behind, taking charge of the criminal syndicates."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mrinzebon appeared in the 2019 novel Alphabet Squadron, written by Alexander Freed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
