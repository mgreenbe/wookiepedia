Around 21 BBY, Poggle the Lesser fled here after his droid factory was destroyed by the Galactic Republic during the Second Battle of Geonosis. Jedi Master Luminara Unduli and her clone trooper Buzz followed Poggle to the temple, but were attacked by Karina's horde upon arrival. The undead warriors killed Buzz and took Luminara into the catacombs below to Karina. Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Commander Cody and a squad of troopers flew to the temple once a sandstorm had passed to find Luminara when they were swarmed by the undead Geonosians as they entered. The temple's supports in the catacombs were shot down by the troopers as the Jedi rescued Luminara and captured Poggle. The Progate Temple caved in seconds after the Jedi, Poggle, and remaining troops escaped, burying Karina."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
