He worked from Nar Shaddaa during the rule of the Galactic Empire. He supplied many things that were illegal even on Nar Shaddaa. Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, Torga was the target of a failed assassination attempt. He went into hiding in his fortress on Nar Shaddaa, and rarely showed himself in public. However, he continued to work toward forming an alliance with Jolla the Hutt, hoping to get some profit. He then decided to hire a group of mercenaries to locate Nak Simm's killer and expose Moska\u2014his rival\u2014as the brains behind the assassination attempts. He presented their evidence to Jolla at a grand party, but Jolla merely shrugged it off, and Torga's plan backfired."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
