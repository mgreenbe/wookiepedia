After the Imperial Remnant's new Head of State, Gilad Pellaeon, captured six star systems along the Entralla Route as a show of force against the New Republic, the New Republic dispatched the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Lusankya to counter the Imperials. While Lusankya was en route, the Imperial 181st Imperial Fighter Group, under the leadership of Turr Phennir, captured both Tartaglia and Hewett from the New Republic with the assistance of a complement of Imperial-class Star Destroyers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
