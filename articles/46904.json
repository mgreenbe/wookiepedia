It facilitated communication and sensor scans for the base, due to Fangol's thick mist which blocked all communications and sensor scans. It was manned exclusively by droids, who shut down the moon upon contact with potential hostile visitors to the star system. The moon was destroyed by the Galactic Empire during the assault on Fangol."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
