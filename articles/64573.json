The study, which was considered groundbreaking by the Ruurian historian S. V. Skynx, concluded that the \"sole-surviving\" floating fortress from Xim's empire, on display at Boonta, displayed evidence of more recent Nikto manufacture to an Expansionist Era architectural style. Hextrophon's conclusion led to the Hutts preventing any further academic studies of the station. Hextrophon also studied holo-iconography from the same period."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
