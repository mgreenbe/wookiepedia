It had been created by Sienar Fleet Systems in order to recondition obsolete machinery in its junkyards. Those hulk compactors used a large, low-powered tractor beam to pick up hulks of junk, and were equipped with heavy armor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Republic's conquest of the junk world, hulk collectors were a fairly common sight, even being noticed by the Jedi duo Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi during their pursuit of CIS scouts. After the chase, they were encountered again during an ambush of a Separatist supply convoy en route to an excavation site."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
