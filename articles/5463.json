The AT-AP had an angular hull that was situated above two multi-jointed legs and had a smaller, retractable third leg that was mounted in front of the two main legs, and was deployed to steady the vehicle when moving over rough terrain and to brace for the recoil when it fired its primary weapon. The AT-AP, as such, was well balanced and was no more vulnerable to stability issues than other bipedal walkers, despite its appearance. The AT-AP's profile was stated to resemble that of the forward hull section of an All Terrain Tactical Enforcer."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The AT-AP's primary weapon was a powerful long-range heavy mass-driver cannon that was located in the forward hull. The cannon launched a solid durasteel penetrator at hypersonic speeds over extreme distances, and was able to strike targets beyond visual range with proper targeting data. In order to keep the cannon accurate and precise, the AT-AP was equipped with a sophisticated targeting and data-relay suite that worked in conjunction with integrated recoil compensation and gyrostabilization systems. Because of its deadly accuracy displayed during the Clone Wars, it was nicknamed the \"Sniper Tank\" by its users."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to the mass-driver cannon, the AT-AP was equipped with a heavy laser cannon situated in an open-topped dorsal-mounted turret that served in a short-range anti-vehicle capacity and was manned by a gunner, and an underbelly heavy repeating blaster for protection against infantry forces. The AT-AP was operated by a total crew of three, including one pilot and two gunners. The Rebel Alliance modified their AT-APs significantly, including the removal of the ventral heavy repeating blaster. The Rebel Alliance utilized Enhanced AT-AP Walkers, which were equipped with more advanced systems and appeared different to the standard model."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The AT-AP was used for long-range artillery strikes and was also used in supporting roles to other walkers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The AT-AP began production during the height of the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems and served during the Battle of Horain where at least one was destroyed, and the Outer Rim Sieges when they were deployed during the Siege of Saleucami and the Battle of Felucia.
