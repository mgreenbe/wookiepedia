It was an improvement over the old P-s3 ion engines, its fuel efficiency was 15 percent better and the heat exchangers were less prone to flux, qualifying as the primary engine system of the TIE/ln space superiority starfighter. They were also used by TIE/sa bombers, TIE/rb heavy starfighters, TIE/sh shuttles, and TIE Boarding Craft."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As P-s4 ion engines make an appearance every time a TIE/LN starfighter does, this list contains only specific mentions of P-s4 ion engines."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
