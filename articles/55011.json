They lived in cities and flew around the light of streetlamps and windows at night alongside moths in large groups. When they flew in large clouds in cities, it was impossible to pick out a specific glow bug, but when they flew in groups of two or three over a large pond, it was much easier. While searching for the Sith Saber Querdan Dei on the Outer Rim planet of Klatooine, Allana Solo, daughter of Tenel Ka Djo and Jacen Solo, compared her search to the difficulty of finding an individual glowbug."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Glowbugs first appearaed in the 1995 novel Children of the Jedi, written by Barbara Hambly."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
