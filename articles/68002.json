Circa 13 BBY, Creel visited an imprisoned Journeyman Protector\u2014Boba Fett, going by the name Jaster Mereel\u2014who had been detained after murdering a corrupt fellow Protector. Although Creel admitted that the murdered man had been a disgrace to his office and uniform, he expressed to Mereel that he had no right in killing him. Nevertheless, Mereel believed himself to be justified in his actions and told Creel to plead him unrepentant for the crime, despite the Pleader's warnings that he would be facing exile and perhaps even execution. After Creel defended Mereel at his murder trial, the court stripped Mereel of his belongings and exiled him from Concord Dawn."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Iving Creel, born years prior to 31.5 BBY, was a Pleader of the legal system of the distant planet Concord Dawn during the early years of the Galactic Empire's dominion of the galaxy.

Mereel, who had killed his fellow Journeyman Protector and superior officer, Lenovar, for raping his wife, was facing exile and potential execution for his crime. Having come to hear Mereel's desired plea, which he would then announce before the body presiding over Mereel's case, Creel was surprised to hear from the indignant young man that he would stoically be pleading unrepentant. Indeed, Mereel felt himself justified in killing the other Journeyman Protector, a corrupt man whom even Creel regarded as a disgrace to his uniform."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Regardless of Mereel's stated belief that the murdered man had it coming, as Creel explained to him, he had no justification in killing him. Creel proceeded to urge Mereel to swallow his pride and apologize for the crime, otherwise, he warned, Mereel would likely be executed himself for angering the ruling body. Although Mereel again explained that he only regretted that he had not killed the man sooner, Creel urged him one last time to think upon his choice before exiting the jail cell with the unrepentant plea obtained."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Before Creel left, however, Mereel flashed him a strange grin and stated bluntly that one must not love life too much, because everyone eventually dies.

For the murder of a fellow Journeyman Protector and his unrepentant plea, the Concord Dawn trial court stripped Mereel of all that he owned and exiled him from the planet.

Not only did Mereel not rise to greet Creel when he arrived, the discourtesy of which visibly disturbed the elder Creel, but the arrogant way in which Mereel examined Creel annoyed the older man and made him feel as if he were the one facing a trial court."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mereel's stark disregard for the murder initially perturbed Creel, who strongly urged the boy to simply apologize to the court in order to do what he could to save his own life.

However, the character who would later be identified as Creel was first mentioned indirectly as Jaster Mereel's \"pleader\" in the 1995 reference book The Essential Guide to Characters. While the character only appears fleetingly across two pages within Moran's story, he did receive individual entries in the 1998 Star Wars Encyclopedia and the 2000 A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded, albeit mistakenly listed in both under the name \"Irving Creel,\" and the later 2008 The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
