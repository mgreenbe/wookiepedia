The main difference between the Delta-7B and its predecessor the Delta-7, was a relocation of the astromech socket from the port (left) side of the starfighter, to just in front of the cockpit. This, along with a slightly-enlarged center-hull, would allow for a full-size astromech droid to be used instead of the truncated units\u2014such as the R4-P or the R3-D\u2014seen in the earlier-model Delta-7. Also like the Delta-7, the Delta-7B had 4 twin laser-cannons (2 above the \"triangular\"-shaped hull, and 2 right below the \"upper\" cannons, on the underside of the hull). It also typically depended on other spacecraft or an external hyperdrive ring for faster-than-light travel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Anakin Skywalker flew at least one yellow and gray Delta-7B that was damaged during the Battle of Bothawui and later recovered.
