Like all FC-20 speeder bike models, Bloodfin was originally manufactured by Razalon. However, the speeder was heavily modified to remove all nonessential systems, giving Bloodfin the maximum output of speed when traveling across land for Maul's stealth missions. During his apprenticeship to the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, Maul kept Bloodfin docked aboard his modified Star Courier, Scimitar, and later used the speeder bike to pursue Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala's escort during the Naboo Crisis. When Maul reached the Queen's royal starship in the Tatooine desert, he leapt off Bloodfin and engaged the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn in a duel, only moments before the Queen and the Jedi got away. This act revealed Maul and the Sith to the Jedi Order, after a millennia of plotting in secret."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Characteristics"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bloodfin was originally a standard-issue and crescent-shaped FC-20 speeder bike model from the manufacturer Razalon, with a single seat for one pilot and a length of 1.65 meters. The repulsorcraft was heavily modified, however, by its owner, the Zabrak Darth Maul. Maul had the exterior of the speeder bike pared-down and its nonessential systems removed\u2014including its sensor and weapons systems\u2014to make the Sith Speeder as fast as possible when in use. Additionally, Bloodfin had its energy systems modified to divert all power to speed. As a countermeasure to the intensity of the speed Bloodfin acquired, the speeder bike had a built-in \"wait-mode\" for dismount, which allowed Maul to have the Sith Speeder automatically decelerate before it went on standby for him to mount the speeder bike again."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Role"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a Sith Lord, Darth Maul used Bloodfin on assignment from his Sith Master, Darth Sidious, during stealth missions.

While Scimitar had a cloaking device, Bloodfin did not, so Maul used DRK-1 Dark Eye probe droids to spy on his targets after landing planetside. Scimitar would act as the Zabrak's base of operations until Maul's targets were found using his probe droids, at which point he would unload his Sith Speeder and pursue his targets.

Maul, as the Sith apprentice of Sidious, obeyed his Master's command and was eager to gain revenge on the Jedi Order by completing his mission.

Some time after the conclusion of the Boonta Eve Classic podrace, during which Jinn freed the human boy Anakin Skywalker from slavery, Maul located his targets and set a course to intercept the Jedi Master on his return to the Queen's starship.
