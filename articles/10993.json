This site marked the grandest expression of the world's desire to remain connected to nature that differentiated it from the likes of other metropolises such as Nar Shaddaa and Coruscant. As a result, Axial Park cost over seventy billion credits, and Coronet City's civil engineers set aside valuable real estate for the creation of several museums along with landmarks that were separated by beautiful parklands."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Cold War, Axial Park became one of the greatest tragedies of the conflict with the reconstituted Sith Empire when they despoiled the beauty of the land by bombardment.
