Important and respected, clan boars had an income due to their wives' lands. They formed the central core of the clan's army and clan-guard. Clan boars could never hope to aspire to the rank of warlord unless their wife died and they subsequently remarried a matron, or their wife inherited a matronage."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
