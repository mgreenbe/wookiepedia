It was used as a site of contemplation by Arkadianate subjects. It was situated south of Patriot Hall, which was located near the entry barrier guarding the city's entrance and exit points. The square also had several tubes of Synedian algae which served as a source of light and heating for the planet's population."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Siege of Calimondretta, the square was damaged when the Sith Lord Arkadia Calimondra ordered her Citizen Guards to deploy thermal detonators in an attempt to stop the Jedi Knight Kerra Holt.
