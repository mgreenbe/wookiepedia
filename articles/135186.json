In one section of the graveyard, the Crackle, the sandy terrain had been turned to glass from the heat of a crash. The 35 ABY uprising against the First Order added at least one Resurgent-class Star Destroyer to the wreckage littering this area."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"Graveyard of Giants\" is one of the two maps introduced in the free Star Wars Battlefront downloadable content called \"Battle of Jakku\", which was released on December 8, 2015."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Graveyard appears in a promotional video created exclusively for Facebook."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
