They were based on tribubble bongos, but were armed with two surface-to-air missile launchers to defend against enemy aircraft. They were, however, defenseless against other ships or ground forces. The ship's main body was crescent-shaped and had two separate cockpits, and were driven by two propellers on outriggers. Bongo Missiles were constructed at shipyards for a cost of 100 units of carbon and 35 units of nova crystals. Bongo Heavy Missiles saw action against the Trade Federation in 32 BBY during the occupation of Naboo."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Bongo Heavy Missiles appear in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and its 2002 expansion pack.
