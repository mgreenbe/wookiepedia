The Hearth House's members served for life, and were selected by the Field House from a group of candidates. Unlike members of the Field House, each candidate had been trained for political life. The majority of Kinyen's laws were created in the Hearth House; after their creation, the laws were sent to the Field House, which could veto any law passed by the Hearth House. The latter met in a section of Doellin's Ring, the center of Kinyen's planetary government, which was also known as the Hearth House."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Hearth House was mentioned in the 2015 Star Wars Roleplaying expansion Strongholds of Resistance, which was published by Fantasy Flight Games."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
