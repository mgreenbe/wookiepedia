Behind the trunk and between the tusks was a heavily lipped mouth containing small square, white teeth. The back of their heads were crowned with a row of four spikes with a single row of spikes going down the back of their necks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Possessing a thin frame, their arms and legs thickened noticeably below the elbow and the knees. Their feet were similar to a Gungan in that they ended in three short tridactyl toes. Their arms ended in three long, thin black claws, with a fourth as an opposable digit. This did not seem to impede their use of a standard firearm or ability to control a mount."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several were members of the pirate band on Prine that captured Ember Chankeli and Maddie in 19 BBY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
