When they bring this news before the Council of Elders, the Elders are somewhat skeptical of the children, but decide to send out a scouting party the next day. Fearing this would not be soon enough, the children consult Logray. He gives the two a special powder to use on the Phlogs that will make them leave. But as the children run off, they are discovered by Wicket's mother and are forced to go to bed. They later sneak out in the middle of the night and go to the place where the Phlogs are. The sleeping Phlogs wake up and capture the Ewoks, but the two throw Logray's powder in the Phlogs' faces, making them fall back asleep. Soon, the Ewok scout party arrives and attempts to tie the Phlogs to the ground. When the Phlogs wake back up, they become frightened and run back to their home, just as Logray had said. The Ewoks rejoice and declare the day a holiday."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Bibliography"}]}
