Drinking it caused him to pass out and wake up with an unsteady head. He described tsiraki as both sour and sweet, and had mixed feelings on whether it was good or bad. Bounty hunter Jas Emari, one of his teammates, insisted that it tasted like slug bile. Days later, Velus attended a meeting with his team and lamented that he had forgotten to bring a bottle of tsiraki."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Tsiraki first appeared in Aftermath: Life Debt, a 2016 canon novel written by Chuck Wendig.
