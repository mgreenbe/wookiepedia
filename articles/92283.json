Skywalker did not account for the cortosis in the mine to redirect the heat of the explosives, which ended up sending the explosions straight down through the crust of the planet and into its magma, instead of just collapsing the mine tunnels. The result was widespread devastation."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
