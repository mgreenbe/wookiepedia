It was injured during the initial struggle, but Jennir managed to tend to its wounds despite his relatively mediocre healing abilities. After regenerating its strength with the help of his droid H2, who gathered plenty of green food, Jennir rode the beast into battle against the pirate band that had kidnapped his companion Ember Chankeli."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "He later gave it to Maddie, a young girl Chankeli befriended in captivity. The Jedi instructed it to lead them to water, as he had initially found it drinking from a small pool.
