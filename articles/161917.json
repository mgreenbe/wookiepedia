At some point, Vorli departed Veroleem to search for some spacers who would be willing to help the resistance to smuggle some recently-liberated victims of the cult off of Veroleem. Vorli suffered some serious injuries during the course of his mission and when he eventually located a group of suitable spacers, he ran toward them and died of his wounds before he could speak with them. A datacard that Vorli had been carrying fell from his hands and was subsequently recovered by the spacers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
