Sadistic and cruel in nature, Beedo offered his services to whoever could offer the biggest cash reward, accepting jobs that ranged from killing high-profile targets to acting as a bodyguard. When competing in Podraces, he flew a blue MARK IV Flat-Twin Turbojet, which was renowned more for its size than its racing capabilities. Beedo hired himself out to other Podracers who needed jobs done on the track, and the massive Turbojet was generally the right craft for the job. Sometime before 32 BBY, Aldar Beedo's skill as an assassin was called upon by a smuggler who needed a rival crime lord disposed of. The target was the Fluggrian Borzu Nale, and Beedo accepted the job. However, the contract brought upon several aspects of attention to Beedo, most notably the ire of Nale's son, Kam Nale."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Beedo later raced in 32 BBY's Boonta Eve Classic race on the Outer Rim world of Tatooine. Unbeknownst to Beedo, Kam Nale had followed him to Tatooine, where Nale hoped to kill the Glymphid. Meanwhile, Beedo had also signed onto a partnership with the Devlikk Wan Sandage, and together they planned to kill Sandage's nemesis, the Dug Boonta champion Sebulba. The hit failed, as Beedo never caught up to Sebulba. In addition, Sandage crashed into a sandcrawler, which would have wasted the Glymphid's effort if he had destroyed Sebulba. Not backing down from the contract, Beedo and Sandage tried again during the following race located on the planet of Malastare, the Vinta Harvest Classic. Beedo tried to kill Sebulba twice: first during a preliminary race, and again during the main event. Complications arose both times, disallowing the completion of the assignment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Sandage passed away due to his health, and Beedo opted to drop the contract. Instead, he went to work for his former target as a bodyguard for the 24 BBY racing season. Beedo and Sebulba became a formidable team, with Beedo competing in all three major circuits, racking up a heavy list of opponent takedowns. The Glymphid also found popularity on the planet of Gamorr, where his violent racing style earned him the crowd's favor. However, the partnership was not to last, as Nale, under the guise of hardcore Podracer \"Elan Mak,\" was hot on Beedo's trail. Nale eventually reclaimed his father's criminal empire and used his family funds to hire mercenaries to track the elusive Glymphid down. Beedo was finally captured by one of the mercenaries on the marshy jungle world of Baroonda while participating in a Podrace, and was brought back to Nale to face a long-awaited retribution."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biography"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The \"Hit Man\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Born on the the Expansion Region planet of Ploo II, the young Glymphid male Aldar Beedo was born into a time of unrest for his world located in the Ploo sector. The Glymphids were caught up in a long lasting war with the neighboring world of Ploo IV, home to a squat species of amphibians known as Fluggrians. The Fluggrians were well known for their tight knit crime families, and hated the rod-thin Glymphids just as much as the Glymphids hated them. Out of the violent turmoil Beedo rose through the ranks of hired assassins, growing into a cruel and sadistic individual who found himself offering his services to whomever could pay the most money. As if his current path of thrill seeking was not enough, Aldar Beedo also took up the dangerous sport of Podracing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Beedo found that the world of Podracing was just as much in need of assassins and guns-for-hire as anyone else, and that the racing itself would serve as an extra form of profit. Purchasing a Manta RamAir MARK IV Flat-Twin Turbojet and painting it blue, Beedo brought what piloting skills he had into the dangerous sport. Even though the vehicle lacked a strong accelerator at the time, it had a tremendous boost package to bring the vehicle out onto the forefront, topped on with incredible handling. In addition, the massive engines made it both a viable and intimidating adversary on the track. With his aggressive racing style, Beedo eventually earned the nickname \"Hit Man,\" a title that unwittingly pointed at Beedo's other violent profession."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Assassinations and Podraces"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the year 32 BBY, a smuggler by the name of Orin Nyell was making it big in the form of smuggling water to the planet of Sernpidal. The water, however, was coming straight from Ploo IV, and was an especially big detriment to the activities of the Fluggrian crime lord Borzu Nale. Needing to eliminate the competition, Nyell sought out Beedo, the Glymphid hit man-turned-Podracer pilot, and hired him to pull the job of eliminating the head of the Nale crime family. Aldar Beedo accepted the job, and it wasn't long before Borzu was dead, Beedo's payment processed, and Nyell free to conduct his business. With that chapter seemingly closed, Aldar Beedo went back to his racing career."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While considered a second-rate pilot, Beedo still managed to make a name for himself on the ice world of Ando Prime. Beedo turned into a natural ice racer, due in part to his RamAir's excellent traction, and eventually became the track favorite on a course known as Beedo's Wild Ride, named in the Glymphid's honor after he took the course by storm with the three-lap record time of 03:16.697 minutes.

Nale had been grievously tracking down his father's killer for some time, for the most part without a name to follow. When Beedo entered the Boonta Eve Classic of 32 BBY, Nale soon after identified Beedo as the killer. Nale followed Beedo to the Boonta race on Tatooine, planning to enter the race himself and dispose of Beedo on the track. However, Nale wasn't the only one on the hunt. Orin Nyell had learned of Kam Nale's existence, and fearing that the young Fluggrian may try to retake control of his father's empire, Nyell hired the rookie bounty hunter Rango Tel to take care of Nale once and for all."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Boonta Eve Classic"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Collaborating with Wan Sandage"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Boonta Eve Classic of Tatooine was an annual event where Podracer pilots from all corners of the galaxy came to test their skills on Tatooine's harsh desert terrain, and it was there that Beedo put both his racing and assassin skills to the test. Both seasoned professionals and newcomers participated in the race on a regular basis, though the crowd favorite was the vicious Dug pilot Sebulba, an individual that was known to employ various illegal weapons and tactics to gain the upper hand during any given race. However, Sebulba was also quite skillful in his own right, but both his skill and perverse racing style conjured up numerous enemies for him. One such enemy was the aging Devlikk playboy Wan Sandage. Devlikk's had notoriously short life spans, and at the age of six, Sandage believed that his chances of beating Sebulba in a race were diminishing too fast for comfort. The Devlikk figured he had one last card to play. Sandage had learned of the killing of Borzu Nale, and at some point connected the dots and drew a picture of Beedo as the assassin. Learning that Beedo was also participating in the Boonta, Sandage sought the Glymphid out, locating him in the Tatooine city of Mos Espa, where the Boonta was to take place."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the eve of the Boonta race, many of the pilots had retired to Mos Espa's Poodoo Lounge to attend the glimmik concert that racer and two-time Boonta winner Boles Roor was conducting. Sandage approached Beedo while the latter was enjoying a drink and explained his predicament. Beedo listened to the Devlikk's story, though Beedo began to rebuke Sandage after the Devlikk informed Beedo about his knowledge of Borzu Nale. Sandage quickly offered a sum of one hundred thousand wupiupi to eliminate Sebulba during the race. Aware of Sebulba's brutal race tactics and the danger of the job, Beedo demanded a price of two hundred thousand wupiupi up front, which Sandage happily agreed to pay. Sebulba entered the lounge soon after, and both pilots quickly hushed up."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While Sebulba wasn't aware of any names out to get him, he was wary of the possible attempts on his life, and quickly met up with his own hired gun, Dud Bolt. Bolt, like Beedo, worked as both a hit-man and a Podracer pilot. His job at this point though was as a bodyguard to Sebulba, and was just as dangerous as the others when on the track. Meanwhile, hidden in an apartment, Nale laid out his plan for Beedo in a recording. Having purchased a Podracer of his own, an outdated Kurtob KRT 410C, Nale planned to enter the Boonta using what money he could and shoot Beedo down during the race. In another meeting with Sandage located at the bar Maggy the Gorgon's, Beedo noted that his usual fees stood at one hundred thousand truguts for any job, with fifty-thousand upfront and the final fifty-thousand upon completion of the job. Sandage, desperate, agreed to the additional fees."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Dug hunt"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the next morning, the racers assembled at the Mos Espa Grand Arena. Aldar Beedo's Podracer was one of the first on the grid, placed on the outside pole position of the first row, starting right next to Sebulba's massive orange Collor Pondrat Plug-F Mammoth Split-X Podracer. Dud Bolt was, in turn, right behind the both of them. Sandage, however, started in the last row of the pack on the outside position. Nale, having made it to the arena after a narrow encounter with Rango Tel that left the latter dead in the dust, started on the inside of the fourth row, having now changed his name to \"Elan Mak\" in hopes of avoiding the suspicions of Aldar Beedo. The race's host, Jabba the Hutt, began the race after the Troig race announcers, Fodesinbeed Annodue, conducted the opening ceremonies. With the Hutt's go ahead, the racers blasted out into the course for both victory and blood. Beedo and Mak quickly took positions behind Sebulba as the Dug viciously rammed the Gran contestant Mawhonic into a rock wall during the early moments of the race that sped through Mushroom Mesa. Sandage trailed behind the pack near the Xamster pilot Neva Kee. Sandage was quickly surpassed by the sole Human contestant, Anakin Skywalker, who had actually stalled during the race's opening moments. Mak remained in second place for a portion of the first lap, but hung back and landed behind Beedo.

When lap three hung around, Beedo had yet to make his way back to Sebulba and \"Mak\" was having difficulties shooting Beedo's Pod due to Ebe E. Endocott set between them. Sandage eventually flew off course and crashed into a wayward sandcrawler, ending his chances at victory. Bolt, meanwhile, had collided with the Nuknog pilot Ark Roose. Beedo eventually caught up to the top four\u2014Sebulba, Guo, Skywalker, and Gasgano. Using a piece of debris, Sebulba clogged the engines of Guo, causing the Phuii pilot to wreck while moving Beedo a place ahead.

The fifth and final run of the elimination rounds was a course known as the Phoebos Memorial Run, and Aldar Beedo had managed to stay alive long enough to participate. Wan Sandage and Elan Mak had also both successfully competed up to the Memorial Run, and both of them were still out to settle their own scores on the track. During the race's last lap, the Twi'lek racer By't Distombe was in the lead with Sebulba trailing close behind, piloting the Pod he bought from Anakin Skywalker.

Little did Beedo realize, though, that Mak had taken a position above him and was preparing to fire his own blaster at the Glymphid. Neither of the gunmen were able to make their shot, though, as Sebulba made a quick dash for the lead ahead of Distombe. Sebulba threw an empty bottle of Vinta Harvest Ale behind him, which struck the Twi'lek racer in the forehead. Distombe lost control and flew over a geyser, which caused his cockpit to explode, launching Distombe through the air and forcing the other pilots to break off and avoid Distombe's loose engines. Sebulba won the round, with Sandage in second place, followed closely by Mak and Beedo.

The Red Iaro, partnered with the Gran senator Aks Moe, needed the Jedi removed from the affair in order to successfully assassinate Sooflie. However, they were not the only ones looking to remove the prince. Another Lannik terrorist known as the Chosen One was also looking to upset the peace conference and hired Beedo's to kill the Jedi Master Even Piell, a Lannik himself, during the upcoming Vinta Harvest race when the Jedi's speeders passed through the course.

The pilots darted off, with Beedo keeping Sebulba square in his sights. As planned, the Jedi's taxi speeders had made their way into a portion of the track that wove through a Malastare city. The speeders carried the Jedi Council ambassadors, including Mace Windu, Piell, and Adi Gallia. Aldar Beedo narrowly missed the Jedi's speeders as he sped through the course, but slowed down in order to allow Sebulba to pass him.

At this point Beedo made his move, firing his blaster pistol. The shot lagged behind and missed Sebulba's pod entirely. Instead, he shot Gallia's line and sent the Jedi tumbling down to the ground below. The Jedi were rescued by another speeder, however, and as such Beedo failed to acquire either bounty. Sebulba later sped into and killed the Red Iaro leader Myk'chur Finux Zug, who was attempting to escape the Jedi with a jetpack, thus ending the Red Iaro's efforts.

However, this time around, Sebulba wasn't racing. Sebulba's son Hekula had been moving up the playing field, and it was time for Hekula to prove to his father that he could race just as well as Sebulba could. Former Boonta contestants Ody Mandrell and Gasgano were also present within the Great Dordon Caves, where the illegal podrace was held, along with Podracer pilots \"Scorch\" Zanales and Will Neluenf. Also among the racers, and positioned next to Beedo's pit, was Ratts Tyerell's Titan 2150 Podracer, albeit no Ratts Tyerell. Having perished in his collision during the Boonta, his daughter Djulla was sold as a slave to Sebulba by her uncle in order to keep the family financially afloat. In a bid to reverse their uncle's doing, Tyerell's sons, Doby and Deland, took up Podracing themselves in hopes of winning enough money to buy their sister's freedom.

The race started off with Skywalker and Hekula quickly starting their bid for first. Aldar Beedo followed close behind Mandrell with Mak in tow, but Mandrell failed to make the next turn. Mak surged forward, seeing the chance to kill his father's murderer. Mak swung out and in front of Beedo in an attempt to cut the Glymphid off, successfully smashing Beedo into the ground, but forcing the other contestants to scramble to avoid hitting them; the Fluggrian's success was also limited, however, as his pod was caught in the collision as well.

With two of the most dangerous racers together, it was their turn to take the 24 BBY race season by storm, where everyone had scores to settle. Once again, Anakin Skywalker had returned to the Podracing circuits, having re-secured his old Podracer from Sebulba and Hekula. Sebulba had a new toy, however\u2014a massive Plug-G Gargantua Split-X Podracer, painted black. Sebulba was out for a Jedi's blood, and planned to secure it on the race course.

However, Beedo's assassination and racing skills were not enough to keep him out of the hands of the mercenary who claimed him on Baroonda."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Equipment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aldar Beedo used various weapons during races, and maintained and used at least two different Podracers throughout his career. While weapons were illegal on the track, Aldar Beedo was nonetheless able to smuggle a blaster pistol into the Vinta Harvest Classic, and attempted to use it against Sebulba. Beedo's silver pistol had a large, round receiver and a narrow barrel, and it fired green lasers. The weapon was strong enough to cut through magnetic cables."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aldar Beedo's primary Podracer was a Manta RamAir MARK IV-Flat Turbojet, a wide Podracer with two massive engines painted blue with yellow markings that also appeared on the flag Beedo used to represent himself. The RamAir was notable for its above-average stats across the board, minus its acceleration. Its best trait was its handling, performing well on some of the galaxy's twistier courses. However, with upgraded accelerators the vehicle could become a powerhouse of a machine. Perhaps its major downfall was the vehicle's width. The RamAir was much wider than some other pods, and as such was not the perfect choice for the narrower courses with tighter roads that would lead to more close-knit packs. For the narrower courses, Aldar Beedo did have a backup Podracer. The racer shared the previous one's cockpit, and featured MARK IV engines that were half their original size. Whereas the normal engines had two jets on the back for propulsion, the new engines each only had one jet. The fact that the vehicle was drastically smaller meant that Beedo could perform far better on the narrower courses, such as the tracks that Malastare presented. He used both vehicles during the course of 32 BBY, but later solely relied on his original RamAir as his Podracer of choice for the 24 BBY season."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aldar Beedo did not wear much in the way of gear, and seldom wore anything. Around 32 BBY he could be found wearing shorts and a brown racing cap with a black and white checker pattern down the center. He also sometimes wore a brown shirt and wrapped a bandolier around himself."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aldar Beedo first appeared in the 1999 novel Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace written by Terry Brooks, based on the film of the same name released later the same year, which was directed by George Lucas. Detailed concept art was created for Beedo, most of it deisgned by Terryl Whitlatch. An equally detailed maquette was built by the Lucasfilm Ltd. art department. The character was only realized in the film as a low-resolution digital model that was used for medium and distance shots of the character's Podracer. A graphic was created using the maquette to be used for view-screens in the film, though it could be seen only fleetingly."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aldar Beedo had a far more substantial appearance in the 1999 video game Star Wars Episode I: Racer, released on the same day as the film. Beedo's backstory was fleshed out in the game's companion guides published by Prima and Nintendo Power. Also, while he did not make an appearance, Beedo was mentioned in the Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace video game. His parked racer could also be encountered by the player. Aldar Beedo later went on to appear in Racer's sequel, Star Wars: Racer Revenge, and the 2012 Xbox 360 video game Kinect Star Wars, where Beedo acted a major character in the game's ambiguously canon Podracing feature. In Revenge and Racer Beedo was voiced by Nick Jameson, who also voiced Knire Dark in Revenge. Beedo later received a brief mention in the novel Tatooine Ghost."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The conflict between Beedo and Kam Nale was explored in several Star Wars Legends publications, but the conflict did not receive closure until 2013 with the release of the Star Wars Blog article The Not-So Magnificent Seven, which expanded on the lives of several untalented bounty hunters. Both Beedo and Nale were mentioned under Rango Tel's entry in the blog article. While Aldar Beedo has never been realized as an action figure, he has appeared twice as a LEGO mini-figure. The first one was designed out of several parts of other minifigures, which bore only a fleeting resemblance to Beedo. The second mini-figure was a single mold without any moving pieces, based on Beedo's maquette."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
