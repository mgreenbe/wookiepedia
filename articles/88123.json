Aware that Rowan was looking for a kyber crystal, Maynar tried to offer Rowan her family's crystal but he told her to keep it. Maynar believed that the crystals did not do much and were a myth. When Rowan explained that the crystals amplified their connection to the Force, she dismissed it as a myth as well. Rowan disagreed but Maynar expressed dissatisfaction that she had to stay behind on Qalydon with her dad and their kaadu."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly later, Imperial forces under the Imperial officers Durpin and Plumestriker raided her village, seeking kyber crystals for the Empire's second Death Star.
