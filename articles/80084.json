The family was a rival of the Ferlani family, another Esseles-based criminal syndicate, and infrequent clashes occurred between the two. At some point, the Largo family gained some new political allies and at around the same time, a group of young upstarts from among Essles' criminal families arranged for police and Imperial raids to stike down a number of their families. The Largo family's chieftains subsequently denied any involvement in causing the raids."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
