Behind the feelers, three small spikes protruded from the bog rat's chin on each side. Each of a bog rat's limbs ended in a four fingered hand with long talons capable of digging.

Bog rats' poor eyesight made them ideal prey for oggdos. Hyper-aggressive and territorial, bog rats often hunted in packs in order to surround their foes. This allowed them to pose a threat to larger creatures like humans. When fighting, they would pretend to retreat and burrow underground before suddenly attacking."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They were also known to gradually form mutualistic relationships with their predatory neighbours, the splox. Splox would disturb bogling nests, luring them to the surface to be eaten by bog rats. With the adults taken care of, splox would then burrow into the nests and consume the bogling eggs, undisturbed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 14 BBY, bog rats were a common pest on Bogano and could be found in the areas surrounding the Bogano Vault built by the Zeffo species.

In-game, they are enemies that the player can encounter on Bogano. The purpose of the bog rat was to be a simple, basic enemy. The design team went through a wide array of designs before settling on a mix of a prairie dog and a one-eyed, shelled caterpillar. Bog rat concept art was done by artist Jean-Francois Rey."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
