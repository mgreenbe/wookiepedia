They were a subscriber to, and commenter on, Cynabar's Droid Datalog. In 2 BBY, WompRat commented on the entry for the X1-Lioness TDL Nanny Droid stating that the security of the droid's processors were easy to bypass. WompRat's brother's children had managed to use a computer probe\u2014supplied by WompRat\u2014to insert programming routines into their nanny droid that allowed them to stay up late. Two years later, WompRat complained about the number of ASP-7 labor droids present in Mos Eisley, and commented on the entry for the CLL-8 binary load lifter that Cybot Galactica used the same binary language that was used in moisture vaparators. As a result, Jawas tended to scavenge programming modules from vaporators to repair damaged load lifters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
