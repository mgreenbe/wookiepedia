When Grand Admiral Thrawn located the Phoenix Squadron's base on Atollon, General Jan Dodonna ordered both the Massassi Group and Phoenix Cell fleets to jump to hyperspace and regroup at the rally point. However, the Rebels were unable to escape due to two Interdicgtor-class Star Destroyers that were part of Thrawn's fleet.
