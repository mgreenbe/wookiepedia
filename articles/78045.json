A non-regulation weapon, Krennic's DT-29 was custom-fitted with a macroscope. Krennic used the weapon to injure the rebel Cassian Andor and later attempted to kill Jyn Erso, but was shot from behind by Andor before he could pull the trigger. The blaster, and Krennic, were subsequently destroyed when the Death Star fired on their location with its superlaser."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Actor Ben Mendelsohn, who portrayed Orson Krennic in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, imagined the weapon as a heirloom that had been passed down through generations to Krennic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
