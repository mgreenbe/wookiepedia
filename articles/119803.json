It was located inside of the Bhishana Bhaga when it crashed on Krykas V. The Sanctum Sanctorum was the only thing that kept Min Erenthen from dying during the crash. The Sanctum Sanctorum was an outdated A4 Juggernaut that was modified by Erethen as a mobile workshop and escape vehicle. While on Krykas V the Sanctum Sanctorum had polarizing field generators to allow electronic equipment to be used in the atmosphere of Krykas V within around fifty meters of the vehicle. After Min Erathen was rescued by a group of mercenaries it was unknown whether it was taken off Krykas V or destroyed by Min Erethen to keep it out of the hands of others."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
