Every system was located by its XYZ coordinates; X measured the system's \"east-west\" location, Y measured its \"north-south\" location, and Z measured its distance above or below the galactic plane. The system was known as the Coruscant coordinates system as it was centered on Coruscant rather than the actual galactic center - Coruscant was dignified with XYZ coordinates of 0,0,0 (Triple Zero in military speak). In the Coruscant system, a parsec was 3.26 light-years, with fifteen parsecs corresponding to one unit on the coordinates scale. A negative number for X, Y or Z coordinates indicated that the star system was west of, south of, or below Coruscant's position."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "All starship navigation computers contained XYZ coordinates for billions of star systems."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Examples"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
