The algae-beds were extremely intelligent, with a highly complex brain. Like many such species, considered to be super-brains, they were unable to move around independently. As a consequence, the algae-beds had little involvement in the galactic community. They were known of in the galaxy by 0 BBY. By that point, Luke Skywalker, then an inhabitant of the remote planet Tatooine, had seen a picture of the giant algae-beds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "John Chesterman created these giant algae-beds for Cantina Communications, a vignette included in Star Wars Official Poster Monthly 16, published in 1979 by Paradise Press.
