Believing that Durd would promise to offer aid and supplies for the wounded, Brandeh and the villagers agreed to his statement. After some time, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, posing as farmers, arrived to warn the inhabitants about the Separatist's plot until one of the shields of the village threatened to fail, causing the refinery to collapse. When the residents were suffering, Brandeh and Greti assisted Obi-Wan and Skywalker in healing several of the villagers from the illness. As Durd learned that the two Jedi were hiding in Torbel, he sent an army of Battle droids to eliminate them. As the Separatists attacked the village, Brandeh was killed by a swarm of Mosquito droids during the fight."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
