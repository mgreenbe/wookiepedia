He joined Galactic Alliance Security and had achieved the rank of lieutenant by 44 ABY, when he was preparing to be tested for a promotion to captain. Thewles was present when the Lambda-class shuttle DeepRay returned to the Senate Building on Coruscant. Piloted by one \"Sela Dorn,\" DeepRay returned Chief of State Natasi Daala's Chief of Staff, Wynn Dorvan, General Merratt Jaxton, and Senator Fost Bramsin from the first Tendrando Arms Celebrity Sabacc Charity Challenge. Thewles met with Dorn and ordered that she take off again, as she had only been authorized to drop off the passengers and leave. However, when she began a false restart of the ship's powered-down systems, she set off a staged explosion of the right stern thruster. Dorn feigned anger at him, but smoke from the staged explosion set off the hangar's fire-control systems, causing foam to smother them. Thewles then granted Dorn time for a mechanic to look over the DeepRay and agreed to take her out on a dinner date. Unbeknownst to Thewles, Dorn was in fact the Jedi Knight Seha Dorvald, and the DeepRay's true mission was to sneak Jedi Masters Kyp Durron and Octa Ramis into the Senate Building in preparation for a Jedi coup of the Galactic Alliance government."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thewles took Dorn out for dinner and dancing, and according to Dorvald, the date went well. Meanwhile, a conspiracy involving Imperial Moff Drikl Lecersen, General Jaxton, and Senators Fost Bramsin and Haydnat Treen also planned to overthrow Daala. They noticed Dorvald's actions and wished to discover what her purpose was, and to that end they faked a poisoning of Jaxton, Lecersen, and the Senate water supply, making Dorvald appear guilty of the act. Dorvald\u2014whose charade as Sela Dorn the Galactic Alliance had discovered\u2014was wanted as a suspect for attempted murder. Soon afterward, Thewles was arrested by the Galactic Alliance Military Police for conspiracy to commit murder, as he had been seen with Dorvald. He was soon acquitted due to lack of a motive, but he quickly began arranged his resignation from Galactic Alliance Security anyway. Before his resignation was processed, however, he used multiple favors to speak with Dorvald in the Senate Building's Security Center. After sweeping the room for listening devices and making sure they would not be overheard, he began to interrogate her. She insisted that she had not poisoned them, but Thewles began to dig further into the issue, suggesting that she had become aware of the conspiracy involving Lecersen and Jaxton. She warned him to be careful, and suggested that he was going to just get himself killed. When he showed no signs of backing out, she tried to plead that she was psychotic and thought that the Senators were all impostors, but he just wished her luck and left the room."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thewles' resignation was finally processed and, released from duty, he became a civilian. Soon afterward, the New Jedi Order set into motion a coup of the government to oust Daala from her office. As the news of the coup unfolded, crowds of beings swarmed the Senate Plaza, which was barricaded by security troopers. There, Thewles saw a holocam operator moving toward the Senate Building, which was protected by several sets of quad-linked lasers with enough power to shoot down starfighters; lasers that were set to fire if anyone came within fifty meters. A Quarren corporal ordered the man back, but he ignored her, and Thewles pushed his way through the crowd and convinced the corporal to shoot the man on the stun setting, lest he move within range of the lasers and they open fire on the crowd. The Quarren stunned the man in time to stop him, and the crowd reacted with outrage.

Soon afterward, Djo traveled to Klatooine to join in the negotiations, and while Organa Solo, her husband, Han, and Djo all attended a meeting with the negotiators, Amelia decided to take matters into her own hands. Thus, when the family protocol droid, C-3PO, went missing, she decided to go out looking for him in hopes of finding the dark side man and stopping him from hurting her mother. Thewles did not want to allow Amelia out of the Solos' ship, the Millennium Falcon, because Organa Solo had given them orders to stay in; but he agreed to accompany her outside anyway when he realized she would bother him about it constantly if he did not."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They soon found C-3PO, who had been integrated into a meeting of the Manumission Mandate Militia, a droids' rights group.

When they realized she was missing, Thewles contacted Organa Solo, who quickly went to find her adopted daughter. Amelia, meanwhile, located the dark side man\u2014who was actually Querdan Dei of the Lost Tribe of Sith\u2014and stopped him from his completing his mission to assassinate Djo.
