After the murder of Yoog Skell, Drathul was escalated to High Prefect of the Intendant caste. However, he endured much embarrassment as Intendants were accused of complicity in the Jeedai heresy, which Nom Anor actually planted. When Zonama Sekot arrived at Yuuzhan'tar, Drathul, a Quorealist, demanded Anor's help in discrediting Supreme Overlord Shimrra, but Anor would not help. During the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar, Drathul accompanied High Priest Jakan and Master Shaper Qelah Kwaad to the Well of the World Brain, where they intended to sacrifice Han Solo, Leia Organa Solo and Harrar to the brain.
