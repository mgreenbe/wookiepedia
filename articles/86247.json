The Mandalorians used these devices in the years prior to the Clone Wars to imprison Knights of the Jedi Order, though they were eventually outlawed by Duchess Satine Kryze, who ushered in an era of peace for her war-stricken planet. By 19 BBY, only one vault remained. Following the Siege of Mandalore in that same year, this last device was used to transport the world's despot ruler Maul from Mandalore's capital city Sundari to the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tribunal, scheduled to deliver the rogue dark sider to the planet Coruscant."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While the ship was en route to the Core Worlds, however, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine delivered Order 66 to the commanders of the Clone Army, instructing them to execute all Jedi.
