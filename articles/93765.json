They were herded by the sentient occupants of their homeworld for food and were the main ingredient in the traditional mugruebe stew, which was popular on Agamar but not elsewhere in the galaxy. One family to raise mugruebes on Agamar was that of the Rebel pilot Keyan Farlander, whose parents owned a struggling ranch of the creatures. The ranch however was destroyed by a galactic bombardment carried out by Imperial forces as punishment for resistance to the Empire on Agamar. Mugruebe spit-sauce was an ingredient used in Agamar slider served at Dex's Diner, a diner on the planet Coruscant owned by the Besalisk Dexter Jettster."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
