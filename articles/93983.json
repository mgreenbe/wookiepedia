The latter took ninety-eight local days to complete an orbit around its sun. When viewed from the planetoid, Murk's light was dim maroon in color and was not brighter than a moon of an average planet of the galaxy. In fact, Murk was so dim that it was invisible to naked-eye observers on all of the inhabited planets of the Moddell subsector."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Galactic Civil War, the Galactic Empire began the construction of the Death Star II battlestation over the Forest Moon of Endor, in the Endor system. To allow for expeditious\u2014and secret\u2014transportation of necessary materials and components to Endor, the Empire artificially extended a hyperlane, subsequently known as the Sanctuary Pipeline, directly to Endor, with the Murk system becoming a penultimate stop on the new hyperspace route. As a result, the system's star emerged from the obscurity characteristic to most red dwarfs and became relatively notable."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To add another layer of secrecy to the Death Star project, an Imperial cargo-transfer station was established on the planetoid Murk. In the dim light of the planetoid's sun, Imperial crews of the station unloaded cargoes of raw materials and components from deep-space haulers and superfreighters traveling along the Sanctuary Pipeline for further transportation to the Endor system. Following the Imperial defeat by the Rebel Alliance at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, the Sanctuary Pipeline became largely unnavigable, and the Murk transfer station was abandoned."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The star Murk was first mentioned in the article \"Endor and the Moddell Sector,\" which was authored by Craig Robert Carey, Daniel Wallace, and Jason Fry, and was published in Star Wars Gamer 9 on February 22, 2002.
