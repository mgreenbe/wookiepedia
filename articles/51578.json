Following the formation of the Galactic Empire, the planet fell under Imperial occupation, led by Captain Bragg. After Singh was imprisoned for speaking out against the occupation, GS-8 escaped, calling for help. The informant Cid received the message, sending the unit of former clone commandos known as the Bad Batch to meet with GS-8 outside the capital city of Raxulon. The Bad Batch entered Singh's residence and rescued the senator, escaping in an All Terrain Tactical Enforcer. Though they were pursued by Imperial forces, they managed to return to the Bad Batch's starship, Havoc Marauder, and escaped from Raxus. GS-8 and Singh accompanied the Bad Batch to Ord Mantell, where they met with Cid, who inquired about payment."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "GS-8 appeared in \"Common Ground,\" the tenth episode of the series Star Wars: The Bad Batch, released on Disney+ on July 2, 2021.
