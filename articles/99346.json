By that time, it had been pirated by the Lost Tribe of Sith for use in the Tribe's war fleet. In 44 ABY, Sith apprentice Vestara Khai called for reinforcements on Pydyr. The Obuuri was sent with High Lord Sarasu Taalon, Sith Saber Gavar Khai, and dozens more Sith in response to the call. On Pydyr, the Obuuri flew with the Jade Shadow in search of Abeloth, but due to Fallanassi illusions in the White Current, the Sith pilots neglected to see a cliff and thus flew the Obuuri into it, resulting in their deaths and the destruction of the troop shuttle."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
