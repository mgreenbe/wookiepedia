Blue 9 was responsible for destroying Nute Gunray's Trade Federation shuttle. The fighter then attempted to destroy the Consular-class cruiser carrying a Jedi delegation. The Jedi used a Force illusion to convince Blue 9's pilot his ship had suffered critical damage from numerous attacks by Republic fighters. Panicked, the pilot ejected from his fighter, the entire cockpit detaching and floating to safely while the rest of the ship crashed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
