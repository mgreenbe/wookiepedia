While there, he made a fortune illegally selling tibanna gas that was mined from Bespin's atmosphere to arms dealers. Around three years after the Battle of Yavin, Yoxgit and two other Ugnaughts were walking through one of Cloud City's corridors while deep in discussion when the city's Baron Administrator Lando Calrissian emerged from an adjoining room with the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca and the Rebel leader Princess Leia Organa in toe. Yoxgit and the other Ugnaughts then split off down a separate route to the four, who went on to meet with the Sith Lord Darth Vader who captured Solo, Chewbacca and Organa. Shortly after the trio's capture, Cloud City was overrun by the Empire under Vader's command. Organa and Chewbacca managed to escape from Imperial clutches with the aid of Calrissian and the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, but Solo was frozen in carbonite and whisked away by the bounty hunter Boba Fett."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Member of Jabba's court"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sometime within the next year after this event, Yoxgit abandoned Bespin and made his way to the desert planet Tatooine, where he found work with the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. While the Ugnaught served the Hutt, Jabba was in possession of the frozen Solo, who he displayed in his Palace. Around four years after the Battle of Yavin, Skywalker, Calrissian, Organa, Chewbacca and the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 made an attempt to rescue Solo, with Calrissian taking a position undercover at the palace and the droids being gifted to Jabba by Skywalker. Organa then arrived with Chewbacca and managed to succeed in thawing him out of his carbonite prison before being captured by Jabba and his men. Yoxgit was then present in the throne room when Skywalker arrived, entering the palace at night while most of the court was asleep. As the court awoke, the Jedi attempted to negotiate with the Hutt, but when things turned sour he threatened Jabba with a DL-18 blaster pistol, prompting the Hutt to drop him through a trapdoor into the pit were his pet rancor was kept, accidentally dropping a Gamorrean guard into the pit as well."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yoxgit and the other court members rushed forward to witness the rancor feast, but the beast only managed to devour the guard before being killed by Skywalker. Outraged, Jabba demanded that Skywalker, Solo and Chewbacca be executed. Yoxgit was then amongst the many members of Jabba's court who accompanied the Hutt on his sail barge Khetanna to the Great Pit of Carkoon, where the prisoners were to be fed to a sarlacc. While on the barge, Yoxgit sat drinking with other members of the court until they arrived at the pit.
