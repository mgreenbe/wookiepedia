He typically spent more time abusing the crew of his Cloudship than planning his raids. After a botched attack on Serenno's funeral moon, Mantero, in which three Nihil were lost, the Talortai Strike Udi Dis, who had served the Cloud for several years, killed Scarspike by slashing his throat with a wingblade. Dis was subsequently promoted to serving Eye of the Nihil Marchion Ro on a mission to the planet Rystan."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
