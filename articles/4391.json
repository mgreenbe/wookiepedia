As the entire surface of Manaan was covered with water, Ahto City was the only above-surface city on the entire planet. The city was mainly inhabited by the Selkath, Manaan's native species. The Selkath were amphibious in nature, and only built the city to accommodate the offworlders that came to Manaan. The main export of Manaan was the healing liquid, kolto. The kolto was collected and distributed by the Selkath, who shipped it off-world from Ahto City. The city's greatest time of prosperity was during the Jedi Civil War. Manaan was neutral during the war, and catered to the needs of both the Galactic Republic, and Darth Malak's Sith Empire. After the decline of kolto and the rise of bacta, the Republic abandoned Manaan to its own devices. During the Great Galactic War, the true Sith Empire completely destroyed every landmass on Manaan, including Ahto City, forcing the Selkath to retreat to their ocean underworld. Ahto City would not be re-inhabited until it was rebuilt during the rise of the Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Infinite Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Millennia before the formation of the Republic, Manaan was a member of the Infinite Empire. During its reign, the Selkath were enslaved and used to build colossal monuments for the Rakata. The Infinite Empire fell, however, due to a plague, after which the Selkath were freed. Those Selkath enslaved and shipped off-planet soon returned to their homes, and began to rebuild their civilization. When the Selkath made contact with off-worlders, the aquatic beings built Ahto City in order to accommodate these new guests. Ahto City soon became a major trading hub, as the Selkath started to export their kolto to the rest of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Jedi Civil War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Jedi Civil War, Manaan remained neutral, housing both the Republic and Sith. These two warring faction established embassies in Ahto City to coordinate their respective kolto shipments to destinations where they were needed, as well as stake their claim on the planet."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Soldiers of both armies roamed the city streets, assaulting each other verbally but restraining from any physical conflict due to strict laws in the city. Even with these laws in place, street fights were not uncommon, as the Sith and Republic soldiers would taunt and prod the opposite side until one attacked. Both conflicting groups felt the sting of the Selkath laws when this occurred, however, and the factions involved in these skirmishes would face heavy consequences."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The two sides were given equal kolto rations. However, both conspired to attempt to gain the upper hand on the other. The Republic negotiated with top Selkath officials, who honored the Republic's integrity and also knew the consequences if the Sith won the war. These officials, including Shelkar, the de facto leader of Manaan, allowed the Republic to use a secret kolto mining facility located deep underwater."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Sith began kidnapping Force-sensitive children in the hopes of brainwashing them into overthrowing the government, and taking over Manaan to give the Sith all the kolto. One such child was Shasa, who would one day form the Order of Shasa, a Force-sensitive cult that would protect Manaan until the days of the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the arrival of the amnesiac Revan, who had visited the planet and city prior to his memory loss, both plans were ultimately discovered and dealt with accordingly."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Great Galactic War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the resurgence of the true Sith three centuries later, Ahto City once more became an important location. This would not last long, however, as the Sith categorically refused to accept the traditional Selkath position of neutrality. Ahto City, along with all the other Selkath surface cities, were destroyed by the forces of the Sith and the Selkath forced beneath the surface of their oceans."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Decline"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kolto production, naturally, declined and prices, too, soared as a result. Customers began to flock to the emerging competition, bacta. Offworlders abandoned Manaan, and the Selkath returned to their underwater cities. During this period of isolation, the Selkath became primitive, with young Selkath warlords destabilizing the government and social order of Manaan. Ahto City was left empty for the most part, and fell into disrepair."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The kolto supply returned, however, and was known to be used as early as 1013 BBY. Since the supply was used during the Galactic Civil War, it can be assumed that the Selkath resumed the shipment of kolto offworld. As such, it is also logical to assume that Ahto City was once again inhabited by the Selkath, who used the city to transport kolto offworld as they used to do."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the Galactic Empire, the Selkath had continued their primitive behaviors to the point that the mere sight of two Star Destroyers in orbit was enough to convince the Selkath to surrender Manaan to the Imperials. Using orbital depth charges to destroy the underwater cities of the Selkath, the Empire drove the Selkath to Ahto City, where they were enslaved by the Empire. Ahto City, however, was refurbished and utilized by the Empire, who then constructed a large base and the Ahto Luxury Resorts. Rich humans inhabited the resorts, using Selkath slaves as servants."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Because of Ahto City's transformation, the Selkath were then forced to live in basic, poorly-constructed floating villages. The Order of Shasa, under the secret guidance of Darth Vader, invaded Manaan and killed any Imperial unfortunate enough to cross their path. In their frenzy, the Order murdered all the guests as well. Vader intended these events to occur; he had driven the Shasan adepts to the dark side, so he could later command the Shasans to obey the will of their new master, Emperor Palpatine."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ahto City was re-inhabited, and kolto (which experienced a revitalization, at least on Manaan) was distributed from the planet for the remainder of the Galactic Civil War."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The massive city floated atop the world-spanning ocean utilizing a buoyancy system that involved the massive city-center. Ahto City is shell-shaped, with a \"base\" that slopes down into the water. The area around the city's center was filled with hangars and landing zones. The landing zones were supervised by Selkath dock officers. Upon arrival in Ahto City, a visitor would need to pay a docking fee, or otherwise, they would not be admitted. The gates into the city were often guarded by Mark IV assault droids, that would use armed force to prevent any visitor that refused to pay the docking fee, from entering the city."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cameras were used extensively throughout the city, and were perhaps the most volatile tool of the Ahto City Civil Authority (ACCA), the service that enforced the laws in Ahto City. Only embassies and hangars were not monitored. Well crafted fountains dotted the many courtyards of Ahto City, around which travelers and Selkath mingled and socialized. The courtyards overlooked the ocean, making the courtyards scenic places for tourists to enjoy. Rather than have closed roofs, open rafters served overlooked many spots in Ahto City, and served as light sources for many locations across the city."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Recreation was abundant in Ahto City, and its inhabitants possessed many means to pass the time. The extensive city of Ahto held various resorts, hotels, cantinas, and swoop lounges for its people. Swoop racing was the most popular sport in Ahto City. Manaan's famous swoop track was located in the center of the city, on the surface of the water.

Because of the Sith Embassy there, there was a strong concentration of Sith troops in the area, and thus there was frequent recruiting of new officers and troops by the Sith. Swoop fans and Sith troops roamed the area. Revan is known to have passed through this area of Ahto City in his second quest to find the Star Forge. Upon entry of the east courtyard, Revan was stopped momentarily by a group of Sith soldiers demanding 20 credits for right of passage. Revan simply paid the Sith to avoid trouble. He was confronted and taken to court after storming the Sith Embassy there, though was released soon after, and is rumored to have raced and become champion at the swoop tracks there."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Ahto East Central"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ahto East Central was located between Ahto East and Ahto West Central in Ahto City on Manaan. It was the location of the Republic Embassy led by Roland Wann and a hotel owned by Ignus, where Sunry killed a Sith woman named Elassa Huros. At the Republic Embassy, Roland Wann had the redeemed Jedi Revan break into the Sith Embassy and take back a droid the Sith captured, and in return, let Revan take a submersible to the Hrakert Station to search for a Star Map. At the hotel, Revan, as Sunry's arbiter, investigated the murder of Elassa. He learned that a Rodian named Gluupor planted Sunry's medal on Elassa's body for the Sith, making it seem that Sunry did it (despite the fact that Sunry did do it), and he learned from a pazaak player named Firith Me that Elassa was a Dark Jedi.

A large fountain was located in a central area leading up to the main courtyard. The door of the courtyard was guarded by a security droid that would restrain or incapacitate anyone who did not comply with the Selkath dock officer and pay the docking fee needed to enter the city. The main courtyard had a circular pool of water in its center. The main kolto distribution center was located here as well.

It was the headquarters of the Selkath Court of Justice. It also contained a prison. It even contained a bar where the redeemed Jedi Revan met a Selkath named Shaelas, who told them that his daughter Shasa and several young Selkath had disappeared, and he believed the Sith Empire was responsible. Revan learned from an Iridonian mercenary that the Selkath were indeed lured into the Sith Embassy, and that the mercenary did it himself. After Revan broke into the Sith Embassy, he convinced Shasa and the others that the Sith were trying to take over Manaan. Revan was arrested for breaking into the Embassy, but was found innocent when he exposed the Sith's plot. When Revan came with Jolee Bindo to Ahto City West, they were greeted by Elora, the wife of Jolee's friend Sunry.

It also attracted more amateur racers such as the Ithorian Queedle Molto. The swoop track was run by T'sllth and Sslamoth during the time of the Jedi Civil War. During Manaan's prosperity, many businessmen opened up shops to sell simple commodities, weapons, and droid parts, such as Yortal Ixlis. The war hero Sunry, and his wife Elora stayed in Ahto as well.

Should any faction threaten Manaan or Ahto City, the Selkath would destroy the kolto. This tactic was very efficient, and was brutally enforced. The Selkath also sought to keep domestic peace through a series of strict laws and extensive security forces. The Ahto City Civil Authority kept the peace in Ahto City, through armed force when necessary. During times of war, rival factions were prohibited from disturbing the peace. If a disturbance occurred, the ACCA would enact kolto sanctions upon the faction responsible. Individuals could be imprisoned, fined, or even executed.
