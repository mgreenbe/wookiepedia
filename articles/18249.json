Through the act of fishing, it was possible to lure and catch blowfish and use their meat as ingredients in various foodstuffs.

They could be found swimming in the bodies of water of multiple worlds throughout the galaxy, including Corellia, Dantooine, Dathomir, Endor, Issor, Naboo, Rori, Talus, and Yavin 4. They could even be found in the sulfur pools and rivers of Lok, and in the few oases of the desert world of Tatooine. Relatively small, with green skin of varying hues and dark beady eyes, one of the blowfish's most distinguishing features were their puffiness. By affixing various forms of bait to a fishing pole, including grubs, insects or worms, it was possible for individuals to lure and reel blowfish out of the water through the act of fishing. After being caught, blowfish meat could be used as ingredients in various foodstuffs. Their snouts could also be deep-fried and served as a meal of their own."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the Galactic Civil War, following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, a spacer scoured the galaxy for fish, including a particularly rare variety of blowfish.

Jackson that was originally published in Star Wars Adventure Journal 12 by West End Games in February 1997. They were later included as fishable creatures in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts, prior to its closure on December 15, 2011. Players who used fishing poles could catch blowfish on all the original worlds of Star Wars Galaxies, including Corellia, Dantooine, Dathomir, Endor, Lok, Naboo, Rori, Talus, Tatooine, and Yavin 4. According to the game files, blowfish could have also been found on Taanab, but that world was cut from the final release of Galaxies, rendering that particular information ambiguous in the Star Wars Legends continuity."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As with most other fish in the game, blowfish could be harvested for their resources. With the release of Chapter 7: A Collection of Heroes on November 1, 2007, a collection quest titled The Reel Life was added to the game. To complete this collection, players had to successfully catch seven fish, including a \"Rare Blowfish\" which could be found on any of the original aforementioned worlds. Completing this collection would award the player with the title of \"Novice Angler.\" Although players could choose not to complete this collection, this article assumes 100% game completion."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
