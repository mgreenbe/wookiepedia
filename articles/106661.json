Tipn, despite the impatience that came naturally to his species, was an excellent researcher with keen eyes and mind. Nearly ten years after the destruction of Mount Tantiss, Na'al enlisted Tipn to join him in a confidential fact-finding mission to the Kathol sector, investigating for Mon Mothma some unusual reports connected to Grand Admiral Thrawn. As preliminary research, Na'al tasked Tipn with reviewing his original notes regarding the Thrawn campaign before boarding a shuttle for Exocron. Tipn prepared a preliminary report based on Na'als material for his professor's review, which also included information from the New Republic archives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Among Tipn's acquaintances at the university was the boisterous Coruscant native, Herg."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
