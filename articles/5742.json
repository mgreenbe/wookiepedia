They were used as an ingredient in the dish known as all-Almakian apple pie, a part of the cultural cuisine of the Leffingite species of the world Almak, who greatly enjoyed eating the pie. For use in the pie, fresh and juicy apples would be spiced with Kessinnamon and then baked into a golden pom seed flour crust. The Besalisk chef Dexter Jettster's eatery, Dex's Diner in the CoCo Town district of the planet Coruscant served all-Almakian apple pie as a dessert for 2.5 credits with the option of adding denta bean ice cream for an additional 2.2 credits, as Jettster was fond of the dish. Almakian apple fruit juice was also available in the diner in large portions for 2.5 credits and small for 1.7 credits. Both items were available on the menu at some point prior to diner's destruction during the first two years of the Galactic Empire's rule."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Almakian apples were first mentioned in the 2009 StarWars.com Hyperspace exclusive article, \"Dining at Dex's,\" which was written in the style of an in-universe menu for Dex's Diner by Gregory Walker.
