Darth Krayt has declared genocide on the Mon Calamari in the midst of an Imperial Civil War, and Sinde, stranded on-world, is serving as an advisor to the Rangers as they hold off the onslaught brought by Krayt's war machines.

Meanwhile, Darth Azard and Vul Isen\u2014two members of Darth Krayt's One Sith\u2014unleash a monstrous Sea Leviathan into Dac's oceans, and Sinde and Tanquar must reach a compromise regarding how best to deal with the new threat."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fight Another Day is composed of two issues: Legacy's thirty-second and thirty-third.

The two issues of Fight Another Day were released by Dark Horse Comics in January and February of 2009, respectively, and around 25,000 copies of each were shipped to comic shops worldwide. Reception to the story was generally positive amongst fans and reviewers, with its examination of loyalty and duty often named as a highlight.

They are discovered and attacked, however, by aquatic war machines of Krayt's Imperial Army: the Acklay-class mobile fortress Sea Lion and the shark underwater fighters of Shark Squadron. Members of the Mon Calamari Rangers resistance movement come to their rescue inside Krakana underwater fighters, and as a flurry of laser blasts fills the ocean, the Acklay Battle Fortress's Commander Sturves dispatches seatroopers into the melee. Their squadron is quickly disposed of by the lightsaber of Master Treis Sinde, an Imperial Knight of the Empire-in-exile who has been fighting on the side of the Rangers since becoming trapped on-world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Dressed in undersea armor, Sinde storms the Sea Lion's bridge, and massive damage is caused when defensive blaster bolts rupture a fuel tank.

The Rangers return to the dry land of their grotto base, where Sinde berates the Ranger Captain Tanquar for launching a premature attack, thereby preventing them from capturing a badly needed mobile fortress. Although Tanquar did so in order to prevent his people from dying, Sinde tells him to prioritize\u2014they are not fighting for victory, but merely for time, so that other forces in the galaxy may rescue them from without. A plan is then hatched to ferry the recovered refugees to a safer location, and Tanquar and Sinde engage in a calmer conversation, reflecting upon the battle and discussing the question of obedience and loyalty."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, several kilometers away, an Aquatic Terrain Armored Transport watches over Imperial Extermination Camp 28 in the Soheras Trench. Onboard, the Sith Lord Darth Azard and the Sith scientist Vul Isen discuss how to best proceed with the genocide ordered by Darth Krayt, who is also the leader of their One Sith. Isen has adapted a massive Leviathan creature to undersea use, and the two Sith accordingly use the Force to touch the mind of the nearby sleeping Sea Leviathan and bend it to their will. The beast massacres the refugees in the camp, absorbing their life energies and sentience as it does so.

When they spot the Sea Leviathan, it absorbs Adriphar's life energy and sends Shonmai fleeing back to base. Azard and Isen let her go to draw out the Rangers and proceed to argue over which of them is a higher-ranked Sith in Krayt's Order. Back at the grotto, Treis Sinde is finally able to use a jerrybuilt comm unit to contact his Emperor, Roan Fel of the Empire-in-exile. Sinde protests Fel's order that he return to the fortress world of Bastion, but the Emperor is adamant that Sinde's duty is to him and not to the Mon Calamari.

Several devilsquid emerge from the crevasse; Sinde is riding one of them and taming them all with the Force. As they attack the Leviathan, Azard orders shark underwater fighters into the battle despite the loss of shielding around the hatch that doing so will entail.

Sinde regrets killing his former comrade Bor Alsek, believing that the mechanic's only crime was obedience.

He is confident that his skills serve the One Sith as importantly as do those of a warrior, and he rescues Azard from the downed swimmer due to his belief that they are equal servants of Darth Krayt.

Series creators John Ostrander and Jan Duursema developed an extensive cast of characters prior to its launch, but as Legacy progressed, new characters were added to the mix. One such character was Treis Sinde, who first appeared in April 2008's Legacy 22. The issue saw him stranded on the planet Dac after Darth Krayt's declaration of genocide, and concluded with him joining forces with a Mon Calamari resistance movement.

Ostrander considered using the previously established Mon Calamari Knights, a group that first appeared in the fifth chapter of the 2003 Star Wars: Clone Wars cartoon, but as Legacy already featured such similarly named groups as the Jedi Knights and Imperial Knights, he instead sought out permission to create the new \"Mon Calamari Rangers\" for the Legacy era. He hoped for the Rangers to be presented in the same tradition as the Knights despite visual differences between the two. Ostrander was eager to chronicle the Rangers' story under the sea, a setting not normally used in Star Wars comics that he felt offered its own demands and risks."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Omar Francia, the artist behind Fight Another Day, was also excited to work in an underwater environment. He created fully poseable 3D models of all of the arc's vehicles, including the Acklay Battle Fortress's interior, as well as models of the Sea Leviathan and the seatroopers' plasma rifle. This allowed him to place a model in a certain position, print the image, and then pencil it into the comic. His initial design for the Sea Leviathan was done before he knew about the existing Leviathans in Expanded Universe lore, and he later used those Leviathans to develop a more accurate final model. While designing the arc's Mon Calamari characters, Francia was determined to make their faces recognizable and expressive, and not at all like the limited Mon Calamari puppets used in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi\u2014his goal was to show various kinds of faces that would decidedly not give the reader the impression that the Mon Calamari were an \"animal species.\" He also provided the covers for both of Fight Another Day's issues, which were done with a mixture of 3D models and traditional illustrations. Francia's work was praised by Ostrander, who admitted that he had thrown a lot at the artist, and Francia in turn called the story \"beautifully written\" and something on which he wished he could have worked for an entire year rather than a few months."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The story arc's second issue, Fight Another Day, Part 2, introduces new continuity to Legacy by establishing the identity of Roan Fel's grandfather, the first Emperor of the Fel Empire, as Jagged Fel, a star of several Star Wars novels. The first Emperor Fel's identity had been a secret since the 2006 release of Star Wars: Legacy 0, but Ostrander \"felt it was necessary, appropriate, and it was time\" to make the reveal. The issue's script was approved by Lucasfilm Ltd., who, according to Ostrander, would have removed the revelation if they had felt that it compromised the novels in which Jagged was still appearing."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In addition to Ostrander's script and Francia's penciling, inking, and cover art, Brad Anderson's colors and Michael Heisler's letters helped bring both issues of Fight Another Day to life.
