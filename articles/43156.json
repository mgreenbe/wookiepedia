Divided into multiple communes, members were either elders or acolytes within the group. They were lead by the Council of Elders. The Elders preached that the Force was like \"fire\" and that it should not be sensed by any living being. Relationships between elders and acolytes were considered far more important than those between parents and children. The Force-sensitive Zeen Mrala and her parents were members of the group, as was Mrala's best friend Krix Kamerat. The commune Mrala and Krix were part of moved around from planet to planet until Mrala was ten years old, at which point it settled on Trymant IV for what seemed a permanent basis. The Gran Tromak was an Elder of the group."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
