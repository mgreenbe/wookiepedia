He greeted the commandos with a snide remark about their armor, which was fitted with winged jetpack. The clone Commando Fi almost hit Barlex in the face when he extended his wings, and proceeded to make several attempts at humor. The NCO however was unsmiling, and pointed out to the Mandalorian-trained commandos that members of their adopted culture were often fighting for the Separatists as mercenaries. This led to the compartment going quiet before the squad's Sergeant Niner both subtly and unofficially reprimanded Fi. Barlex then walked off without a word when the Niner suggest they contact their Jedi commander, General Arligan Zey."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time Barlex met Omega Squad, he had become weary of supporting special forces and had lost ten clone brothers to Mandalorians. Like other members of the 2nd Airborne, this meant he held strong feelings of animosity towards them and their culture.

However, he dropped the topic and walked off after a moment when Niner suggested they get in contact with General Zey, with Darman believing the sergeant withheld a final comment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a clone of Jango, Barlex was also a human male and stood at a height of 1.83 meters."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Barlex appeared in the 2007 novel Republic Commando: True Colors, part of the Republic Commando series written by Karen Traviss.
