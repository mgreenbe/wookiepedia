Trandoshans relished the thrill of a hunt, and were known to embark on a hunting related rite of passage. They were also famous for their ability to regenerate limbs and heal effectively. Garnac was a Trandoshan hunter who operated a game preserve on the moon Wasskah, and oversaw his son's fatally failed rite of passage, which was done in the form of hunting a Jedi Padawan. One of the most feared bounty hunters in the galaxy was a Trandoshan known as Bossk, who pulled jobs for various organizations, including the Galactic Empire."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Biology and appearance"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trandoshans were sentient humanoids with smooth, scaly skin. Trandoshans ranged from being tall and fairly gaunt, to being short and more rotund. Trandoshans were powerful beings, and had long thin arms that ended in either three thick digits, or four thin digits, including a thumb. Trandoshans had a pair of eyes set back on a pointed skull, and a jaw filled with pointed teeth. Some Trandoshans even had a crown of feathers atop there skulls.They hatched from eggs, with individuals who shared a hatch of eggs calling each other clutchmates."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trandoshans often walked barefooted, and had feet with three digits each. A Trandoshan's skin color could vary wildly, and Trandoshans could be found with green, red, orange, brown, or yellow skin. Some Trandoshans, such as one named Smug, had brownish-orange skin with red stripes on his face. They were able to regrow their limbs if they were severed. Trandoshans used their sharp claws to climb tall trees in the forest or jungles they naturally inhabited."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trandoshans came from the planet Trandosha, and were hunting enthusiasts. They hunted creatures such as frist wolves. They worshiped a goddess called the Scorekeeper. They were identifiable in the galactic community by the time of the galactic Clone Wars, and had taken control of the moon Wasskah, which became the location of island game preserves. The hunter Garnac had control of the island designated as Island Four, and ran a hunting guild based out of a floating fortress that hovered above the island. Garnac's scouts traveled to different worlds and collect other sentient beings before delivering them to Wasskah and dumping them on Island Four, where the prisoners would be hunted for sport. During the Clone Wars, at least three Jedi younglings had been captured and brought to Wasskah. For a long time, the trio of younglings managed to avoid the Trandoshans, who continued to deliver other prey to the island. Eventually, the Trandoshan Lo-Taren captured the Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano on the planet Felucia and brought her to island four alongside several other prisoners. Once delivered to the island, Tano escaped and discovered the other younglings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Garnac's son, Dar, later set out to kill Tano himself as part of an important rite of passage, but was instead killed by the Jedi. Garnac gave chase, killing the youngling Kalifa. Later, other Trandoshan scouts abducted the Wookiee Chewbacca, but before Chewbacca could be successfully delivered, the Trandoshan transport ship was damaged and it crashed on the hunting island. Tano killed the two man crew, and escaped the wreckage with Chewbacca. The Wookiee was able to craft a communications device with some of the scavenged wreckage, and was able to contact the Wookiee General Tarfful. Tano, the remaining younglings, and the Wookiee forces engaged Garnac's guild on their fortress, and killed all of the Trandoshan hunters."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, the bounty hunter Bossk took on numerous jobs, and eventually acted as a bodyguard to the upcoming bounty hunter Boba Fett. In time, Bossk would be revered as one of the most feared bounty hunters in the galaxy. On one occasion, Bossk visited the planet Lothal to collect a bounty on the Dug criminal Gronson Takkaro. This brought him into contact with the young Force-sensitive human youth Ezra Bridger and into conflict with the corrupt Imperial Security Bureau Lieutenant Jenkes, who was in league with Takkaro. With the help of Bridger, Bossk succeeded in exposing Jenkes' criminal dealings."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Imperial Era, five Trandoshans were part of an acquisition crew working for the Xonti Brothers. Led by Noka, they went to Kashyyyk to capture Wookiees. Kootan was keen to kill one but Noka reminded him of the job at hand. Noka used his scanner to locate a Wookiee and they found one which was sleeping. Kootan shot a stun at it to realize it was bleeding and left for dead. The Trandoshans then found themselves under attack by Black Krrsantan who killed the other three Trandoshans and pinned down Noka and Kootan. Kootan tried to kill Krrsantan and was knocked out by the Wookiee before being thrown into a tree, killing him. Krrsantan then demanded that Noka brought him to the Xonti Brothers. Noka did so and lived on to tell his story to two journalists."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Feresk Tssat served as a member of the New Republic's Vanguard Squadron during the Galactic Civil War following the Battle of Endor, and fought against the Galactic Empire's Titan Squadron."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Trandoshans in the galaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The species had a poor history with the Wookiees, who hated the reptilian people. Some Trandoshans found other outlets for work, as opposed to hunting. By the time of the Clone Wars one was Gha Nachkt, who lived life as a salvager. He was eventually hired by the Confederacy of Independent Systems to scour the sites of damaged ships owned by the Galactic Republic and find any useful data or scraps. Nachkt eventually recovered the R2 series astromech droid R2-D2 from a Republic Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor, but the droid was eventually recovered by the Jedi General and Knight Anakin Skywalker, while Nachkt was killed by Confederate General Grievous."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Trandoshan Bossk's bounty hunting career brought him to various locales across the galaxy, and was for a time involved with the bounty hunters Aurra Sing and Castas.

Sing later killed Castas, while Bossk and Fett were arrested by Republic authorities after a failed assassination. However, during a prison riot, both Bossk and Fett escaped the Republic prison they were sent to. They later formed a team of bounty hunters on the planet Tatooine and accept a job posted by the Belugan government on the planet Quarzite. Although Bossk was subdued by adversaries during the mission, team member Asajj Ventress was able to complete the mission, to a degree.
