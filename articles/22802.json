She also began a campaign of ousting Imperial sympathizers and holdouts from the sector, which included the distribution of the Report Imperial Holdouts propaganda piece. Her campaign proved so zealous that inspectors from the New Republic attempted to temper it in order to reduce the atmosphere of paranoia and distrust that it created. Her campaign was mentioned in the book A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy, which was released shortly after the Hosnian Cataclysm."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Callidona Vens was first mentioned in the reference book Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released on October 25, 2016."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
