Subsequently, he was Senator of the Alderaan sector of the Imperial Senate from 19 BBY to 1 BBY. He was Princess Leia Organa's adoptive father and a friend of Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, Rahm Kota, and Jedi Knight Ylenic It'kla. He was also a friend and colleague of Leia's biological mother, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, and was present when Leia and her twin brother Luke Skywalker were born. He was married to Queen Breha Organa. One of the main founders of the Rebel Alliance, he was killed when the Death Star obliterated Alderaan.

Born in 67 BBY, his parents were two of the most important people on his homeworld. His mother Mazicia was the reigning queen of Alderaan, and his father belonged to the prestigious House of Organa, one of the princely dynasties among which the crown of Alderaan traditionally befell. He also had three sisters: Rouge, Celly, and Tia. Additionally, his maternal uncle Tayvor Mandirly was a notorious agricultural expert. Like all the scions of his noble bloodline, the young Organa enjoyed a golden childhood. While he always had all the material things he needed, Organa's parents were careful never to spoil him. As a youth, Bail Organa was trained to eventually take up Alderaan's seat in the Galactic Senate. Despite the rampant corruption that had spread its tentacles to most of the political class, the actions of civic-minded statesmen such as Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum finally convinced Organa that he could do well in the Senate."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Despite his pampered upbringing, Organa maintained many personal acquaintances across Alderaan which crossed class boundaries. Taking an interest in the son of two archivists at the Royal Library of Alderaan, Organa championed the young Halagad Ventor's education and assisted him in his rise through the academy system. The two swiftly became friends and it wasn't long before Ventor was a welcomed presence around House Organa. Inspired by Ventor's desires to become a Jedi, Organa assisted the youth in pursuing his dreams by granting him access to both mental and physical training across Alderaan. In 32 BBY, Bail Organa's future ascent to the position of viceroy was put into question. That year, Alderaan was wracked by the Alderaan Ascendancy Contention, a bitter feud between House Organa and the rival House Antilles over which family had the proper claim to the title of viceroy. After three deadlocked votes, the High Council of Alderaan appealed to the Galactic Senate for mediation, and a special dispatch led by the Jedi Master Jorus C'baoth was sent to oversee the dispute. During this time, Organa became acquainted with the Jedi Knight Everen Ettene who championed his cause and the two maintained a positive relationship. In less than one month, C'baoth guided the tribunal to a decision that favored the Organas. Subsequently, Organa's father was made viceroy and the rivaling families were joined together in marriage at the Jedi's behest."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the wake of the standoff, the victorious Organa family decided to celebrate by sending young Organa, his sister Tia and the Ventor family as their representatives to the Okonomo Retreat on the beautiful island resort. Eager to spend the holiday hunting manka cats that roamed wild on the island, Organa did not reprimand his sister or his friend as they made passes at each other. Despite Tia's proposed marriage to a nobleman of House Vandron, she pursued her brother's friend during the trip all while Organa turned a blind eye. The three were out hunting when Organa received word that a terrible tragedy had befallen the retreat. A madman had infiltrated the dinner and had infected the gathered nobility with a hive virus which provoked anthropophagitism in its victims. Among the victims were both of Ventor's parents', Ean and Zollet, who in their madness ate each other before being consumed by the madman."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point when it seemed that the old Republic was already crumbling, a group of Alderaanian scouts under the responsibility of First Chairman Organa discovered the remote and mineral-rich planet of Isis.

Padm\u00e9 Amidala, queen of the Naboo, came to plead her case before the Senate and, seeing that Valorum would not react, she called for a Vote of No Confidence in the Chancellor. Despite not being a senator, Bail Organa was present in the plenary chamber, and he stepped out to second the motion, as did the Roonan delegate Edcel Bar Gane. Before the chair could find a motive to postpone the vote, Organa argued that the motion could suffer no delay, since it was on the floor and had to be voted during the ongoing session."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the election of Palpatine as Supreme Chancellor, Senator Bail Antilles chose to retire, and Organa succeeded him. In order to occupy that position, he was forced to abandon his viceroyship, delegating his powers to a regent.

He also established political relationships with other like minded Senators, including Garm Bel Iblis of Corellia, Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo, Doman Beruss of Illodia, and Mon Mothma of Chandrila, with whom he had a very good personal friendship. His residence on Coruscant during his time as a Senator was called Cantham House, although he had an apartment in 500 Republica as well. Organa also became close friends with former Chancellor Valorum. Despite his elevated position, Organa remained committed to his friends. Approached by Halagad Ventor after the young man had spent some time at the Jedi academy on Almas, Ventor expressed frustration regarding his inability to find a master that would train him in the ways of the Jedi. To assist, Organa arranged for a meeting with his old contact within the Order: Everen Ettene. Speaking with the Jedi Knight and vouching for Ventor's dedication and hard-work, Ettene saw something of herself in Ventor and agreed to train the unconventional Padawan."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 28 BBY, Organa took in his turn the mantle of viceroy, which he would keep till his death. As such, he was properly addressed as \"His Serene Highness, Prince Bail Prestor Organa, First Chairman and Viceroy of Alderaan.\" In the years that followed Organa's appointment as a senator, the Republic went through an unprecedented crisis. The former Jedi Master Dooku, Count of Serenno, founded the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a loose organization of planets who wished to withdraw from the Republic. During that Separatist Crisis, Organa pushed to have Alderaan loosen its immigration restrictions to allow refugee resettlement. He was also appointed to the Loyalist Committee, a political group determined to keep the Republic from fragmenting under the Separatist influence. Though not a militarist, it was expected he would vote in favor of creating an army to defend the Republic. In 22 BBY, when it became clear that the Separatists had no interest in negotiations, Organa advocated quick action but realized that the Senate would not approve using the clone army found on Kamino. Organa thus voted for granting Palpatine emergency powers. Shortly thereafter, the Republic and the Separatists went to war against each other.

The Alderaanian prince welcomed that nomination, which he regarded as a great honor. In the days following this promotion, Organa departed Coruscant and formed an elite team to travel to Virgillia 7 as part of a rescue mission to recover his old friend Padawan Ventor. Ventor had been assigned to Virgillia several months prior and had gone missing, along with Master Ettene and two other Jedi.

Trapped on the planet's surface, Organa and his relief effort soon began to run out of food and water. When Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi led an assault against Trench's fleet in an attempt to break through and aid Organa, the Admiral responded with a withering attack, forcing the Jedi to retreat behind a nearby moon. Trench staged several devastating attack runs against Organa's on-planet camp to draw Skywalker and Kenobi out from behind the moon, but he and his blockade were finally broken by a stealth ship manned by Skywalker and Admiral Wullf Yularen."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Journey to Zigoola"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A few months into the Clone Wars, Bail was given coordinates to the Sith planet Zigoola by his secret informant, Alinta.

Obi-Wan Kenobi was dispatched to the Senator's apartment to learn of this threat. Refusing to reveal his contact, and demanding to accompany the Jedi to the Sith world, Kenobi and Organa proceeded on a journey to Wild Space. Throughout the trip, Organa and Kenobi argued and harassed each other; Kenobi attempted to kill the Senator several times after losing control of himself to the Sith spirits of the world. By the end of the trip however, the duo managed to come to a mutual respect, and even a friendship, after surviving together on the barren world. While investigating the planet, they discovered that the source of all the Sith attacks was from a Sith holocron located inside a Sith Temple.

Organa, aboard his personal ship, the Tantive IV, traveled to Toydaria, where he met up with the Gungan Representative Jar Jar Binks at the Katuunko's royal palace. Together they were granted an audience with the king and his council, but negotiations were rendered complicated by the arrival of Lott Dod, the Senate representative of the Trade Federation sent by Count Dooku, who learned of Organa's mission when they intercepted his communication with the Jedi. Organa and Binks stressed their humanitarian intentions in the matter, but Dod pointed out that by agreeing to deliver supplies to Ryloth, it would be aiding Republic troops, and with Toydaria having declared strict neutrality in this war, it would destroy their neutrality. After thorough consideration, Katuunko officially denied the Republic their rights to a base on Toydaria. However, Organa and Binks were secretly met by the king, who told them that the humanitarian factor had actually gained his favor. He agreed to load the supply ships they already had at the time with a preliminary supply of resources if Organa could keep the involvement of Toydaria secret from. Organa protested, as the supplies would only aid the Twi'leks for a few days, but the king said this was the best he could supply.

Fighting the bill, Senators Organa and Amidala found data on the Banking Clan, revealing that they were charging 25% interest, which drained funds from social programs. Realizing the threat of this bad loan, the Senators approached other like-minded congressmen, such as Senator Mot-Not Rab in hopes of forming a caucus with little success. After meeting with Senator Farr, who was recently the victim of an assault, Organa himself was attacked by two bounty hunters, Robonino and Chata Hyoki.

Organa, along with his allies, attended the funeral, and was present in Chancellor Palpatine's office afterwards when Lieutenant Tan Divo reported that Farr's death was in fact a murder. When Organa and Amidala, along with Mothma and the late Farr's aide Lolo Purs expressed a discontent in Divo's investigation methods, the two set out to find the murderer themselves. Speaking with two of Farr's greatest political enemies, Senators Mee Deechi and Halle Burtoni, they discovered that Farr had held several secretive meetings within Coruscant's docking area. After setting out to the locale only to be shot at, lose their attacker, and be thoroughly reprimanded by Lt. Divo, Organa and Amidala returned to Deechi's office under the suspicion that he set them up, only to discover the Umbaran dead, stabbed through the heart. Divo quickly shut them in his heavily guarded office with Mothma and Purs for protection, although Farr's former aide expressed an immediate discontent with the situation and stormed out. She returned soon after, claiming to have been attacked by Senator Burtoni, who was soon arrested and charged for murder. As the Kaminoan was being led out in handcuffs, Amidala had one last memory, that Farr was killed by a poison specifically engineered towards Rodians and Lolo Purs had not partaken in any refreshments that day.

In 1975's Adventures of the Starkiller, Episode I: The Star Wars, Antilles is himself an Aquillian Ranger and an agent of the Starkiller; later drafts cemented the character as the father of Princess Leia of Ogana Major. When Ogana Major was renamed Alderaan, the word \"Ogana\" became Leia's last name, albeit slightly respelled. Bail Antilles was accordingly renamed Bail Organa, and went on to be mentioned by name in both the script and novelization of the original Star Wars film, although he was referred to simply as Leia's father in the film itself. An issue of the film's comic book adaptation erroneously calls Leia's father Bail Antilles.

Crispin named the character \"Bail Prestor Organa\" in her 1997 novel The Paradise Snare."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Organa was slated to appear in 1999's Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, and was written into the screenplay as the seconder of Queen Amidala's call for a Vote of No Confidence in Chancellor Valorum's leadership. Star Wars creator George Lucas initially approached the English actor Ray Winstone to portray Princess Leia's stepfather. The two met in a hotel in the West End of London, but the meeting did not go to plan. Winstone was admittedly inebriated from the night before when he turned up for the audition. On his part, Lucas felt the effects of the jet-lag, which prompted him to yawn regularly. Additionally, Winstone asserts that Lucas instantly knew he was wrong for the part as soon as the actor walked in the room, but chose to relay the message through a third party\u2014something at which Winstone took umbrage."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, actor Adrian Dunbar was cast in the role and filmed the scenes, although they were ultimately cut from the film's final product. In his 2001 novel Cloak of Deception, author James Luceno described Dunbar's appearance when writing the character of Bail Antilles, a character mentioned briefly in Episode I who had been intended to be a separate character from Organa, despite both being Senators from Alderaan named Bail. When Jimmy Smits was cast as Organa for 2002's Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, the Star Wars Expanded Universe visually solidified Dunbar's character as Antilles, and Smits's as Organa. Although the issue has been clarified, it is noteworthy that some official materials related to Episode I went to print in 1999 identifying Dunbar's character as Bail Organa."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Portrayal"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Stephen Elliott voiced Organa in the Star Wars radio dramatization.
