However, their helmets featured red-orange markings in a stylized version of Ahsoka Tano's facial markings and skin tone\u2014 representing the clones' camaraderie to the 501st's former Jedi officer.

Tano, along with members of the Mandalore resistance, had arrived to propose a joint operation to remove the Shadow Collective and defeat renegade Sith Lord Maul from Mandalore. After the meeting, Tano met with her former master, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, and walked towards a hangar while conversing that clone troopers shouldn't be saluting her and calling her Commander. Skywalker stated that it was a sign of respect and loyalty, as the clone troopers were aware of her efforts during the Clone Wars."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, they reached the hangar where Clone Captain CT-7567 \"Rex\" stood beside the 332nd Company and called them to attention. Tano walked among them in surprise, noting that they had customized their helmets in a stylized version of her face.

Captain Rex continued that, although the paint job was crude, it was effective and that they were glad she had returned."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Kenobi arrived to the hangar relaying the news that the Battle of Coruscant had commenced and that their forces would be enroute shortly, Tano argued that the Jedi was once again turning their back on people in need. In an attempt to find a solution, Skywalker recommended that he would divide the 501st Legion and create a new division that Tano could lead. Kenobi countered, however, stating that Tano was no longer a Jedi Commander within the Grand Army of the Republic and as such no longer being able to officially lead a contingent of large Republic forces. Skywalker then suggested that Captain Rex should be promoted from Clone Captain to Clone Commander so that the seasoned officer could lead Republic Military forces independently, including the 332nd Company, and take Tano as an advisor, which Kenobi agreed to."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Initial invasion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Preparing for the siege, three Venator-class Star Destroyers arrived above Mandalore and deployed a large contingent of LAAT/i gunships and LAAT carriers that were accompanied by a large force of Kom'rk-class fighter/transports. Mandalorian Prime Minister Almec, a puppet of Maul, contacted Republic leadership about the invasion, complaining of their forces' violation of a long-before established peace as his forces of Mandalorian super commandos prepared for combat. With Sundari's defenses readied, Maul's men made for their battle stations. As the Mandalorian-Republic attack force neared the capital city, a salvo of missiles were fired, downing several gunships and transports."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shadow Collective commandos then attacked the joint force by boarding the transports and killing their passengers. Mandalore resistance troopers and several troopers launched from numerous gunships to repel the attackers as anti-aircraft fire pelted the attack group. Tano joined in the defense, jumping from transport to transport while defeating the commandos. She then jumped to a nearby gunship that was critically hit and began descending. After rescuing the pilot, Tano held on to the gunship until it was near the Sundari shipping docks and leapt to the surface. As she engaged Mandalorian super commandos, the rest of the joint force began arriving with the arrival of Mandalore resistance fighters and the division's troopers, despite losing several gunships and a carrier. Shortly after, gunships began landing at the docks and deployed standard clone troopers, and the Republic managed to quickly capture the area."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Mandalorian-Republic joint force began making inroads into the city, with the Republic division and Mandalore resistance engaging the Shadow Collective's forces on pedestrian walkways and city buildings. Despite the defenses of Shadow Collective, the joint attack force managed to give the Mandalorian commandos stronger opposition than they anticipated, and began reaching the Sundari Royal Palace.

Gunships flew sorties as the 332nd's clone troopers and the Mandalore resistance fighters fought against Shadow Collective forces. After Saxon retreated, Captain Vaughn contacted Commander Rex and informed him that he and his troops located and fought Saxon in the Undercity.

After Vaughn gave Tano a status update, Tano led Vaughn and the other clones into the tunnel system in an attempt to locate the Shadow Collective's forces. Shadow Collective leader Rook Kast and a large group of commandos began to flank them from adjacent tunnels, waiting for the right moment to ambush. Kast then launched a missile at the Republic unit which killed a trooper and disoriented the others, including Tano. Although Tano told the others not to advance, Vaughn led a charge and was followed by the remaining clone troopers. As Tano attempted to locate her unit, the Mandalorian commandos began attacking and killing off the clones."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eventually, Tano reached a central point in the tunnel system and discovered several dead clones and Vaughn critically injured and laying on the floor from a chest wound.

Eventually, reinforcements arrived, including Tano and Rex. After a clone trooper of the unit updated Tano and Rex on the contingent's objective, Tano advised Rex to confirm that C-deck was properly reinforced. As Rex left, Tano walked to clone trooper Sterling, who had been wounded in the fight by a blaster wound to the chest.
