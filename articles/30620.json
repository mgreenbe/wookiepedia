It was an exclusive club that allowed only Coruscant Security Force police officers to enter. Exceptions for non\u2013police officers were made if an officer extended an invitation. The Social Club had several open areas, private booths, a bar, and a separate bar for senior officers."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 21 BBY, GAR Special Operations Brigade Sergeant Kal Skirata met at the CSF Social Club with CSF Captain Jaller Obrim to discuss the possibility of a leak in one of their organizations after one of their operations was compromised by terrorists. Several months later, upon successfully rooting out terrorist cells operating on Coruscant, a reception was held at the Social Club. It was hosted by the CSF's Anti-Terrorism Unit and Organized Crime Unit in honor of the clone commandos of Arca Company and the efforts they had made in bringing down the terrorists. During the party, the clone troopers performed the Dha Werda Verda poem for the CSF cops. Later that evening, Jedi Knight Etain Tur-Mukan admitted to Kal Skirata that she and Darman Skirata, a clone commando, were in love and that she was pregnant with his child. The revelation shocked Kal Skirata who became determined to plan an exit strategy to give his troops a normal life after the Clone Wars. He discussed the issue with Obrim well into the early morning after the party had ended. During the time of the Galactic Alliance, the CSF bar was in operation. In 41 ABY, in the aftermath of the arrest of Chief of State Cal Omas for treason against the Galactic Alliance, tales of Omas' bravery during the arrest circulated among the cops present at the bar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The CSF Social Club first appears in Republic Commando: Triple Zero, which was written by Karen Traviss and published on February 28, 2006.
