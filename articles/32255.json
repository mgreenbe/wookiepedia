Shortly after the First Battle of Geonosis, Lawquane's transport was attacked by Separatist gunships, leaving his fellow soldiers either dead or injured. Lawquane fled, deserting the army, and later married Suu Lawquane. The war later made its way to Saleucami, where Lawquane, Suu, and his two adopted children lived. Lawquane met Clone Captain Rex, who helped defend his family and home from BX-series droid commandos. Rex and Cut overcame their differences, and Rex agreed not to report Cut as a deserter. Sometime during the war, the clones of the Bad Batch visited Cut and his family."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After Order 66 and the end of the Clone Wars, Rex and the Bad Batch visited Cut in succession - the latter after they had defected from the newly-formed Empire and fled Kamino.

He was developed within the Egg Lab, and injected with an inhibitor chip as an embryo, along with all other clones. After he completed his training, he would join the Grand Army of the Republic and leave Kamino."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly after the First Battle of Geonosis, the first battle of the galaxy-wide Clone Wars, Cut was still serving in the Republic Military. On one of his missions, he boarded a troop transport along with several other troopers. Two Separatist gunships cornered and attacked the transport, crashing it, and killing a majority of the clones on board. The droids then proceeded to comb the wreckage and eliminate any surviving clones. Cut fled, realizing there was no chance of survival if he stayed with his fellow soldiers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Cut eventually found his way to the Outer Rim planet of Saleucami, where he met Suu Lawquane, a female Twi'lek. He got to know Suu, and eventually fell in love. The two married, and Cut became the father of two human-Twi'lek hybrid children, Shaeeah and Jek. The four lived together on the planet of Saleucami, where the family maintained a farm. On the farm, the family grew crops and raised livestock, such as the eopies they kept in their barn."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Battle of Saleucami"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 21 BBY, the Clone Wars came to Lawquane's home of Saleucami. Separatist General Grievous intended to invade the planet, however, during the Battle of Saleucami, his landing craft was shot down by the Galactic Republic, forcing him and his droids to flee to the planet surface in escape pods. The Republic then landed on the surface, where Obi-Wan Kenobi and several squads of clone troopers took to speeder bikes in order to find the wreckage of Grievous's escape pod."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Republic's hunt for the general commenced, Clone Captain Rex was injured by a commando droid sniper. Rather than call off the search, Kix, the team medic, decided to find a place for Rex to recover overnight. As the squad debated where to take him, they realized the surrounding eopies were domesticated, and followed them until they came across the Lawquane Family's Farm. As they approached the farm, Cut's wife, Suu Lawquane burst out of the farmhouse, brandishing a blaster rifle. After Jesse explained the situation, Suu offered a bench in the barn for Rex to recover on, where they applied a bacta patch to his wound. As Suu brought in food for Rex, Shaeeah Lawquane lost control of her repulsorlift ball, and ran in after it. Upon seeing Rex, she remarked on the similarity between him and her father, Cut. Suu explained that Cut was delivering their first harvest, and was gone at the time. Rex's squad left, and resumed their search for General Grievous. When Cut returned from delivering the harvest, he entered the barn, only to see a stranger inside. Lawquane cautiously entered the barn, arming himself with a staff, slowly raising it up at the stranger. Rex heard the footsteps, and pulled a blaster pistol on him, which Lawquane swiftly knocked from his hand. Rex and Cut immediately recognized each other as clones. Rex quickly got upset at Cut, and accused him of deserting the Republic Army. As Rex confronted Cut, Shaeeah and Jek ran in, and began talking with their father. Jek showed Cut his drawing, while Shaeeah mentioned her encounter with Rex. When Suu explained the situation to Cut, he said that of course Rex could spend the night, and Jek agreed, saying that they would always help anyone they can."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At dinner, which was a roast nuna, Rex conversed with Cut, debating the ethics of deserting the army they were born to serve. During the conversation, Rex asked is his choice to continue serving matched with Cut's approval. Cut agreed, say that everyone should be able to do whatever they want with their life. Later, over a game of Dejarik, the two continued their conversation. Cut defended himself by telling Rex his story, but Rex remained resentful towards him. After they finished their chores, Cut's two children asked their father if they could play outside. Cut agreed, as long as they stayed within sight of the house. The children ran through the nearby crop field, where they discovered a droid escape pod from the battle overhead. While exploring it, Shaeeah accidentally hit a button with her elbow, activating the group of BX-series droid commandos stored inside. The children ran back to the house, where Cut identified the droids. Cut knew Rex was injured, and volunteered to take on the droids himself, leaving Rex as the last line of defense for his family. Cut gave Rex a blaster pistol, while Cut took his own DC-15A blaster carbine to fight the droids. Rex and the family fled to the upper level, while Cut stayed to battle the droids. Cut skillfully killed the majority of the droids, but ended up getting trapped under debris. The droids then progressed upstairs, chasing after the rest of the family. As Rex defended the family, Cut freed himself, and the two defeated the remaining droids together. Because of their experience together, Rex and Cut developed and understanding of each other's motives."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the morning, Rex had recovered enough to return to his squad. As he prepared to leave, Cut offered him a place in their family. Rex declined, saying that his family was elsewhere.

Rex then left, but did not inform Cut of his destination."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The next day, Clone Force 99 arrived on Saleucami to meet with Cut and his family for advice on how to stay off the grid as deserters. Cut told them that the only way to continue unnoticed was to abandon military life and become a civilian. Cut asked where Crosshair was, but Hunter only told him it was complicated, not telling him that Crosshair betrayed the group and joined the Empire. Hunter introduced Cut and his family to Echo and Omega, and offered to take them off world in their ship. Cut told them that it was too dangerous for his family to travel with them, as the squad were wanted fugitives. He told them that they were making for the spaceport later that day, but when Cut and Hunter arrived there later, they discovered that the Empire had implemented a new policy requiring chain codes for legal passage. Being a clone, Cut would be unable to present proper identification without being discovered as a deserter."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Later, at the farmstead, Jek, Shaeeah, and Omega were playing in the field with a ball. When the ball was accidentally thrown past the fence, Omega went to retrieve it. Beyond the safety of the fence, Omega was stalked by a nexu, which was driven off by Hunter and Suu. This experience led Hunter to believe that he and his team were inadequate guardians for Omega, and he asked Cut and Suu to take her with them off world."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Meanwhile, the Echo and Tech devised a plan to intentionally get their ship impounded and delivered to the dock, where they could create fake chain codes. Unbeknownst to Tech and Echo, however, Omega was sheltering on the ship following her encounter with the nexu. By the time Hunter found out and told the two, the plan was already in motion. Echo and Tech successfully retrieved chain codes, but still had to deliver them to the Lawquanes, who were on the other side of the spaceport. With the amount of clones present, Tech and Echo would be unable to cross in time. Omega took the chain codes, and began crossing the area, placing herself in harm's way. Wrecker saved Omega, and went to provide aid for Echo and Tech, while Omega continued towards the Lawquanes. When she arrived to present the chain codes, she remarked that there was an extra one, and Cut was stunned that Hunter did not tell her of the agreement. Hunter told Omega, and she reluctantly went with the Lawquanes. However, a few moments later, Omega decided to disobey Hunter and ran back to their ship just as they were making their getaway. As Cut was boarding the transport vessel, he was stopped by a clone, who began to recognize him, but was called away to help corral the Bad Batch, allowing Cut to board with his family."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Legacy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the Battle of Endor, Glen Taffral, who lived on Saleucami, mentioned Cut as an example of someone who left war, and instead prioritized his family."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As a human clone, Cut Lawquane shared his face with Jango Fett and stood 1.83 meters tall.

He began to exercise his free will, making the choice to not kill for a living. As he fell in love and got married, this ideal developed. He deeply believed that everyone should get a free choice in what they want to do with their life. When he was confronted by Rex, he held fast to this belief, defending his decision to desert the Republic. Despite this, he fully accepted Rex's decision to remain in the army, saying it fit with his approval perfectly. He was determined to always help anyone he could, an ideal he passed on to his children. He went as far to offer Rex the same choice he made, offering Rex a place within the Lawquane family.

He comforted his terrified children, and prepared to fight the droids with no hesitation.
