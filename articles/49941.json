Greater aptitude granted greater boosts to speed and/or greater duration. The increased speed of the Force-user enabled the individual to perceive and react the world and the entities around them in slow motion, allowing them to dodge attacks easily and attack more quickly with greater accuracy."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The technique was commonly used by many Force-users throughout history, including Jedi, Sith, and the Matukai order, an organization of Force adepts who used the physical body to channel the Force. During the Clone Wars, many Jedi used the ability to great effect on the battlefields. It was also commonly used to increase speed during lightsaber duels as well as in unarmed combat. According to Jedi Master Tionne Solusar's tome regarding the Force, there was a drawback to using this power; using Force speed had a draining effect on a Force-user's energy and metabolism, and required a longer recovery period."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Description"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using the Force to increase one's speed was a common ability among many Force-users throughout history, with many able to both use the Force to increase their muscle speed and to slow down their perception of the world. The increased speed of the Force-user enabled them to see the world and the entities around them in slow motion, allowing them to dodge attacks easily and attack more quickly with greater accuracy. With sufficient skill in this ability, one could actually run on vertical surfaces for brief periods of time."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "According to Tionne Solusar's tome regarding the Force written at the time of the Second Galactic Civil War, Force speed would only be achieved after a Jedi used the Force to attune their entire body with their heightened reflexes. The power could be used with such velocity that they appeared to simply vanish from their previous position. If the user was in unarmed combat, they could use it to swiftly bring an end to a skirmish. However, there was a drawback to using this power; using Force speed had a draining effect on a Force-user's energy and metabolism, and required a longer recovery period."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A core Force ability, Force speed fell under the control area of the Force, which was the first aspect of the Force taught to Jedi Initiates.

In 5000 BBY, Jedi Master Relin Druur used the power when he attacked the Harbinger, which was mining Lignan crystals in the Phaegon system, and, by his own estimate, he was able to cross 100 meters in a second, running in a blur."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Darth Sidious was a great adept of force speed, using it with deadly precision during his mission to kill the Gran senator Pax Teem by killing a pair of Dugs guards at such speed that seemed to be a blur for Human senses and a phantom to security cameras."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi were also known to be skilled in this ability, using it to escape from Trade Federation droidekas. This technique was not limited to the Jedi and Sith however; the Force-using Matukai who focused on channeling the Force through their bodies, were highly skilled in sustaining agility based motions using the Force."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Clone Wars, many Jedi used this ability to great effect on the battlefields, as seen when Jedi Master Mace Windu used this technique to gain momentum for a long-distance Force Jump he was about to perform during the Battle of Dantooine, as well as to augment his fighting ability against Kar Vastor on Haruun Kal."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi could also use the Force to augment their muscles and increase the speed of their movements during combat, heightening their reflexes and increasing the speed of their blocks and blows during engagements. Grand Master Luke Skywalker was proficient in this application of the power, often using the Force to increase the speed of his lightsaber strikes, as seen during his duels with Yuuzhan Vong Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane and UnuThul. During their duel, Jedi Master Mace Windu and Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious both showed considerable skill in this ability, both moving in a blur. In particular, Mace Windu's lightsaber form Vaapad relied on using the Force in this way as in combat it would appear as if he was wielding dozens of swords at once. However, prolonged use of the Force to increase their speed could leave the user dangerously tired."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Slowing down their perception of the world would give a Force-user more time to react to a situation as Luke Skywalker discovered in 3 ABY, during his confrontation with the human replica droid Guri in Prince Xizor's Palace on Coruscant. With guidance from the voice of Ben Kenobi, Luke gave in to the Force and found that time seemed to slow down considerably, allowing him to dodge the assassin's attack and defeat her with ease. Luke would later remark to his students at the Jedi Praxeum that he didn't feel in control of this power and instead felt that it was the Force guiding his actions."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Users"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Force-users of the Republic"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Using the Force to increase the speed of movement was a common ability among many Force-users throughout history, particularly among Jedi such as Johun Othone, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn, as well as Sith such as Kaox Krul, Darth Bane, and Darth Maul. Jedi Relin Druur regularly drew upon the Force to augment his speed, during duels and skirmishes. During their final fight, Druur and Sith Lord Saes Rrogon moved at a speed that was blurry even to Druur's eyes. A Sith Lord in the reformed Sith Empire, Scourge was capable of increasing his speed with the Force, moving at a blinding speed while dodging an attack by mercenaries on Dromund Kaas. During the Great Galactic War, the Jedi Knight Aryn Leneer was a skilled user of Force speed and was able to slow her perception of time so she could time a hyperspace jump perfectly when attempting to infiltrate Coruscant after the Sith assault on the planet. She also drew on the Force to augment her speed during engagements. The Sith Lord Darth Malgus was also proficient in augmenting his speed with the Force and used it during many battles such as the Sith assault on Coruscant and his duel with Leneer."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Clone Wars and the rise of the Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "With the Jedi called to arms in the Clone Wars, many Jedi would use this ability during the many battles of the conflict to aid in combat. The Jedi Generals Mace Windu, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Aayla Secura, were all known to use the Force to enhance their speed in battle. Anakin Skywalker's Padawan Ahsoka Tano was also capable of this technique, using it to outrun podracer Kidd Kareen in a foot race across a bridge on the planet Mon Gazza. Another Padawan, the Chiss Nuru Kungurama, was able to run so fast his feet appeared to barely touch the ground when using this ability. Jedi Master Kit Fisto showed a high level of skill in this ability when engaging a Jedi Killer droid on Ord Cestus, moving in a blur of motion that baffled even the experienced gaze of Obi-Wan Kenobi. He later used this technique to dodge blaster fire and reach a family of four who were cornered by one of the droids. The Human female Jedi Master Taria Damsin used Force sprint while defending the city of Torbel on Lanteeb from a squad of battle droids. The Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress was also known to have used this ability while fighting the other gladiators in the Cauldron. Jedi Masters Roan Shryne, Bol Chatak and Padawan Olee Starstone also used the Force to enhance their speed to put some distance between them and the Clone troopers who were pursuing them after the execution of Order 66. Shryne would later use this ability to flee Darth Vader during the attempt to rescue Senator Fang Zar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "After the rise of the Galactic Empire, another user of Force speed was Darth Vader's Sith apprentice Galen Marek, who would use the Force to quickly cross short distances. The Dark Jedi Thaum Rystra, also in the service of the Empire, was capable of enhancing his speed with the Force. The Jedi Rachi Sitra, who was on the list of the Emperor's Most Wanted, attempted to use Force-enhanced speed when facing the bounty hunter Boba Fett over Dathomir; however, Fett was able to disarm her with a wrist rocket and she was captured."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "New Jedi Order"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It was a common ability among members of the New Jedi Order, with many employing the technique including Mara Jade Skywalker, Anakin Solo, Ulaha Kore, Thann Mithric, Jaina Solo, Tenel Ka, Leia Organa Solo, Tahiri Veila, Kam Solusar, and Ben Skywalker. Jedi Battlemaster Kyle Katarn became proficient in this ability after using it for the first time on Nar Shaddaa to escape 8t88's thugs. He would later use the technique to get access to the administrative tower of Barons Hed. When returning to the Jedi after his absence, Katarn had to use this ability in a test prepared by Luke Skywalker to regain his lightsaber. Katarn would later pass this ability on to his student Jaden Korr, who became skilled in its use during his training at the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 and used it to augment his speed during a brief duel with ancient Jedi Relin Druur. In 11 ABY, under the influence of ancient Sith Lord Exar Kun, Jedi trainee Kyp Durron used the Force to work the controls of the superweapon Sun Crusher with Jedi speed to dodge the tractor beams of the Caridan defense system, before he used the Sun Crusher to destroy the Carida system."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Jedi and later Sith Lord Jacen Solo was also a skilled and frequent user of the technique often using it in dangerous situations and combat. During their first duel, Jaina Solo and Darth Caedus both called on the Force to exchange lightning-fast blows. Jaina experienced a powerful connection to the Force, enabling her to move faster than she ever could before; she believed she could even catch a blaster bolt between her fingers. Fallen Jedi Alema Rar was also a proficient user of this technique, being able to move at speeds that surpassed that which her Jedi training should have allowed her. Another skilled user of this technique was Valin Horn who used this technique while under the influence of a Force madness in an effort to escape his father, Corran, who he believed to be an impostor. Corran Horn also used this technique to keep up with his son as he attempted to bring Valin to his senses. Later after Valin Horn escaped Jedi custody, Jedi Masters' Council member Octa Ramis used a Force-aided burst of speed to gain distance for a jump to land on the classic X-wing starfighter which Valin was using to escape. Seff Hellin, who suffered from the same Force-related madness as Valin, was also capable of using this technique, using it to escape pursuit while attempting to rescue Valin from the Armand Isard Correctional Facility. When Sothais Saar also succumbed to the madness plaguing young Jedi, he displayed the ability to run at a speed that made him appear as a blur of motion while escaping from the Alliance Senate Building."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II, Speed when triggered, augments the game sprite's speed.

However, in the game one of his special abilities is speed, which actually could be the untrained use of Force speed. This is supported by the fact that Force speed was the first Force power Katarn ever learned. A more mundane explanation could be that it is simply the same \"sprint\" ability that is also possessed by Han Solo and Chewbacca within the same game."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, it is possible for the player to learn the power Burst of Speed.

In the Star Wars Roleplaying Game Revised Core Rulebook, there are also different levels of the power named Knight Speed and Master Speed which allow the user to move at up to twenty times and thirty times faster than normal, respectively, and also increase a user's jumping distance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
