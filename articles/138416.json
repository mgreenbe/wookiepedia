In around 3 ABY, TA-418 accompanied Okka to the Ruins of Kolkur on the Outer Rim astronomical object Kolkur. While the two were studying the ruins, they were approached by the rogue archaeologist Doctor Chelli Aphra, who had been hired by the Shadow University student Detta Yao to find the ancient artifacts known as the Rings of Vaale. As Okka had extensively studied the Rings in the past, Yao suggested that Aphra and her crew\u2014the bounty hunter Black Krrsantan and the assassin Just Lucky\u2014seek her assistance. Aphra greeted TA-418 while speaking with Okka, and the droid responded."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Okka refused to help Aphra find the Rings, but was interrupted by the mercenaries of the Tagge family scion Ronen Tagge, who, deriving enjoyment from destroying rare artifacts, had previously sought to find the Rings using the professor's knowledge. The mercenaries attempted to force Okka into working with them, but Aphra's crew initiated a firefight with the mercenaries, and TA-418 hid beside a stone pedestal alongside Okka and Aphra. Okka used her knowledge of the ruins to activate large moving statues, distracting the mercenaries.

The Ark Angel III arrived on Dianth, and the crew disembarked, entering the city of Vaale. While the crew's members were plagued by visions and sounds, Okka and TA-418 discovered the location of the Workshop of the Architects of Vaale, where the Rings were created by the Architects of Vaale. After descending underground toward the workshop's entrance, the crew attempted to find a way inside, with Yao asking TA-418 to scan the mural carved into its door."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While searching for a method of opening the door, the crew inadvertently activated a trap that opened a hole in the floor. Krrsantan, Lucky, and Okka fell as the ground collapsed beneath them, leaving TA-418 with Aphra and Yao. The three of them were immediately confronted by Tagge's mercenaries, who instead ordered Aphra to lead them to the Rings. Aphra pretended to accept Tagge's demands and continued to search the area. The mercenary Tucker activated another trap, which dragged the mercenaries into the hole and also broke through the workshop's door.

Yao held Okka at gunpoint, demanding the artifact, but was tricked by Lucky, who had stolen the Ring.

Before they could board Aphra's starship, vessels of Ronen Tagge's fleet fired upon the Ark Angel III, destroying it and forcing the crew to take shelter from the explosion. Tagge's fleet subsequently attacked Vaale, leaving the ancient city in ruins. As the crew searched the derelict starships that were situated outside the city, Krrsantan discovered a centuries-old vessel from the High Republic that was still intact. Discussing their next move, Aphra suggested lying low until the fleet retreated and allowing Tagge to take the Ring. Okka refused to let Tagge get away with his actions, and Aphra developed a plan to stop him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aphra took advantage of Tagge's previous slicing of TA-418, decrypting the connection and tracking Tagge to his residence in the city of Canto Bight on the planet Cantonica.

Aphra allowed Tagge's forces to board their ship, taking the crew prisoner and bringing them before Tagge. Tagge took Aphra and her crew to his penthouse in Canto Bight, where he revealed that the other Ring of Vaale had already been in his possession.
