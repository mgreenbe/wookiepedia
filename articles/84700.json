Most starports larger than limited services used a standard comm channel to broadcast their METOSPs, making it easier for spacers to know what frequency to monitor. METOSPs also usually informed visitors of additional comm channels for contacting starport control. During their escape from Ysanne Isard, the astromech droids Whistler and Gate used the system to contact Talon Karrde and set up a meeting at the Grand Oradin Hotel."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Example METOSP"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
