He was greeted by this captain and several stormtroopers.

Vader was shocked to learn that the pilot was Luke Skywalker, his own son. The captain was later seen aboard the Executor during a launching of viper probe droids. He witnessed a defective R2 unit transmit a hologram of Emperor Palpatine to Darth Vader. The Emperor had discovered one of Vader's secret students, Tao, and Palpatine ordered his apprentice to execute the boy in front of the crew of the ship.

The captain broke into a sweat over the unexplained absence of Vader, but his worries were unfounded. Vader eventually returned to the ship, having left briefly to bury Tao on his home planet of Shumari."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This individual only appears in the story Perfect Evil, which spanned issues Black and Silver of Star Wars Manga.
