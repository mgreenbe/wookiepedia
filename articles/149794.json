After the Battle of Yavin, he was a slavemaster of the Blackscale Clan and resided in the city of Keren, on the planet Naboo. Around 1 ABY, Trussk and his slavers captured the Wookiee Arrworr and shipped him to Naboo. There, Trussk tortured the Wookiee for weeks. Around the same time, the Blackscale Clan was tracking a smuggler known as Cal Handro. Trussk wanted him dead for having smuggled slaves for a rival Trandoshan clan. At some point, a group of spacers attacked Trussk's fortress on Naboo. These adventurers were investigating the disappearance of Cal Handro and suspected the Blackscale Clan to have captured him. A violent fight erupted and the spacer killed most slavers. Despite his great fighting skills, Trussk was also killed."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Trussk was a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts.
