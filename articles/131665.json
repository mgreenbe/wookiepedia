It is a Del Rey-moderated conversation between Aaron Allston, Troy Denning, and Karen Traviss, the three authors who each wrote a trio of novels for the series. In the interview, the decision to kill Mara Jade Skywalker is discussed, along with favorite characters, the writing and research process, as well as how the authors interacted with one another. Unlike the similar interview carried out regarding The New Jedi Order series, the interview took place two thirds of the way through Legacy of the Force, rather than once the arc had concluded."}]}
