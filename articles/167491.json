She and her captain were captured in the Windfall, pulled out of hyperspace above the planet Mustafar by an Imperial interdictor vessel. The Sith Lord Darth Vader, who sought the Windfall's captain as a descendant of Lady Corvax, had the starship taken to his fortress, where Admiral Gable Karius boarded with an escort of stormtroopers, who shot ZO-E3 and captured her captain. ZO-E3 was imprisoned in a cell next to the Mustafarian Vylip F'alma, who help the two smugglers escape. F'alma sent the smugglers to his clan's priestess, located in Corvax's sanctum below the surface of the planet. They spoke with the priestess, but were followed by Vader. When ZO-E3 attempted to provide an excuse for their escape, Vader used the Force to throw her against a wall. She was later part of the battle on Mustafar."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "ZO-E3 was created for Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series \u2013 Episode I, the first installment of Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series, a three-part virtual reality series created by ILMxLAB.
