Rebel forces tended to be more individualistic and ragtag than the forces of the Imperial Military."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "SpecForce should not be confused with Special Operations (SpecOps) groups who participated in murky undercover missions that typically involved investigating, snooping and hectic seat-of-the-pants assignments with minimal input from Alliance Command. There was a deep rivalry between the two branches. Although SpecForce members recognized the need for SpecOps, and some considered them capable soldiers, they tended to think of Special Operations agents as amateurs who relied on luck to complete their missions. Likewise, SpecOps agents tended to regard their counterparts as a group of arrogant, over-trained grunts with over-inflated opinions of their own importance."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Recruitment and training"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Very few regular soldiers were capable of becoming SpecForce troopers, and all volunteered for service. Imperial special forces candidates underwent an extensive examination to determine political, physical, educational, technical, and mental suitability; they also performed extensive background checks which included interviews of family, friends, and acquaintances to ensure political loyalty. The Alliance did its best to perform background checks but was limited in its ability to perform interviews of relatives and associates. The SpecForce vetting process was run by Alliance Intelligence and comprised mainly of interviews, interrogations, and examinations. The vetting process was given a high priority and resulted in the low penetration of the organization by Imperial agents."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Empire's anti-alien stance gave the Alliance an advantage in creating SpecForce, giving them a large pool of non-Human candidates eager to oppose the New Order. Many of these species possessed abilities particularly suited to covert military operations. In addition, the Empire's oppressive rule caused many Humans to seek service with the Alliance, allowing for a more selective recruitment policy for SpecForce."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "SpecForce candidates had already undergone basic and specialist training. When selected for special forces, the troopers would go through another round of advanced training at a drop-camp. The trainees were taught advanced skills essential for special forces service, but the primary purpose of this phase of training was to weed out candidates lacking the drive to succeed in their missions. The standards in every area of training were high, and the drop-out rate was equally high. Many Alliance regular troopers were SpecForce washouts, though there was no stigma attached to such failure. Simply having been accepted onto a special forces training program was a mark of a trooper's superior qualities, and many failed candidates went on to have successful careers within the Alliance military. Basic SpecForce training included two months of weapons drill using blasters, heavy weaponry, hand weapons, and slugthrowers."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They also performed numerous deployment scenarios, including stealth drills, overland marches, and para-sail and dropship deployments. The exercises would increase in intensity and difficulty as the trainees progressed through the program, and included live-fire drills and failure-rigged reenactments. This stage of training concluded with a realistic war game scenario, the completion of which meant advancement to a further four weeks of specialization training. In addition to military training, recruits attended lectures on military history."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For specialization training, recruits were sent to another training camp where they would train in a particular area of expertise, depending on their natural attributes and proficiencies. This training built on the specific areas learned in basic SpecForce training and prepared them for assignment to one of the many specialized regiments within SpecForce divisions."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The identity of SpecForce recruits was a high-level secret. If the enemy discovered their identities, personality profiles to be constructed and/or their friends and family could be targeted. The trainee ID card carried a holoflat, rank, and security clearance only."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "SpecForce Trooper"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The SpecForces were the ground troops of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, assigned to fleets to be sent on detached duties to sectors that needed them. Infantry platoons of SpecForces were organized into\nformal units, much like the Imperial Army, but in the field they were also divided into task forces, consisting of as many soldiers and as much equipment needed to carry out a specific military objective."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The average SpecForce trooper was a few years older than a regular Rebel soldier, had above average physical and mental abilities and was dedicated to the Alliance and its cause. While they tended to be a little wild in their private lives, when in the field they generally were extremely professional. Like most Alliance soldiers SpecForce troopers were idealistic and committed to the Rebellion against the Empire, although they tended to be even more dedicated. A great number of them were former soldiers from the Empire."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "SpecForce troopers were trained to use a variety of tactics, easily adapting to different environments and finding ways to take cover and hold a position in any situation. Hand blasters were standard for every soldier, but some divisions have been known to specialize in particular equipment for some of the more dangerous missions."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "SpecForce Officer"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A large percentage of the Human SpecForce officers were ex-Imperial military officers who were extensively screened by Alliance Intelligence. They were generally a little younger than regular military officers especially towards the high ranks. The nature of special forces often meant that advancement was faster than regular forces partly because of the higher rate of attrition. SpecForce officers were highly intelligent, creative, and physically fit. They were among the finest military officers in the galaxy during the Rebellion era."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Routine"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "SpecForce personnel spent most of their time training, maintaining their equipment, and traveling. The boredom of preparation was punctuated by moments of extreme danger and stress. When SpecForce troopers were called-up for action, their tours of duty tended to be short and exceptionally unpleasant, in contrast to regular tours that were generally longer and carried a lower level of danger. The major difference between regular and SpecForce soldiers was that the latter actively saw trouble more frequently and were expected to function reliably."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "SpecForce organization"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "SpecForce was organized into formal units much like its Imperial counterparts: divisions, regiments, companies, platoons, squads, and fire teams. However, due to scarcity of resources, they rarely operated as full units, instead organizing into taskforces consisting of the appropriate number of soldiers required for a certain mission."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Divisions"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "SpecForce consisted of about 10 divisions. One division, Command Division, was under General Crix Madine (via subordinate officers) and was attached to Alliance High Command at all times. It possessed regiments representing all SpecForce specializations, which were assigned to various elements of High Command. Five other divisions were allocated more or less regionally, with the balance deployed as rogue divisions operationally attached to sector commands or other SpecForce divisions as needed. The regionally allocated divisions were commanded by a general; the rogue divisions were theoretically under the command of whatever divisional general they were assigned to, but in practice were primarily commanded by the colonels of their regiments."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Regiments"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Regiments were made up of three to six companies (four being the norm), and were commanded by a colonel or, less often, a major. They were consistently numbered within each division by the type of specialist they provided. Like divisions, they were more of an accounting unit than a unit that actually saw action; they provided the pool from which taskforces were assembled. More on regimental specialties are described below."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Companies"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Companies usually consisted of five platoons and were commanded by a major or captain, and were identified by aurebesh letters. There were two types: order companies (also order of battle companies or OBCs), consisting of a single specialist type and used for asset tracking rather than actually seeing action; and taskforce companies (TFCs), which were comprised field mission units and were typically composed of two or three platoons of one specialist type, with two or three other platoons of mixed type rounding the unit out and providing operational flexibility. These companies were typically the largest unit to see combat."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Platoons"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Platoons consisted of four squads and were commanded by a lieutenant. They were designated numerically."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Squads"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Squads consisted of five to fifteen troopers and were commanded by a sergeant. They were designated by color, and were primarily of a particular trooper specialty, though cross-attached elements (usually attached fire teams from other specialties) were common."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "A notable squad that fought at the Battle of Hoth was 4th Squad commanded by Corporal Jobin."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Fire Teams"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fire teams consisted of two to five troopers, supervised by a senior trooper (often called first trooper in scandocs). They were the basic tactical element of squad maneuvering, and it was recommended that troopers not act in the field without their fire team members."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Taskforces"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Taskforces were the real units which performed SpecForce missions. They could be of nearly any size, though most were company or platoon sized. They were commanded by a taskforce commander (TC), a temporary position given an officer assigned to command a given mission. The TC was not a coveted position, and was given out on the basis of ability; usually, the TC was of a rank appropriate for the size of the taskforce (e.g. a platoon-sized taskforce would typically have a lieutenant as TC). Once selected, the TC would requisition as many appropriately-sized units as were needed for the mission, subject to availability, to comprise the taskforce."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "SpecForce Regiments"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As was mentioned, regiments were consistently numbered within each division, with the number indicating the type of specialist they consisted of."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "1st Regiment - SpecForce SpaceOps Regiment"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "SpecForce SpaceOps, also called SpecForce Marines or Rebel Marines, were trained primarily for combat onboard ships, though they also had training in zero-g combat, space survival and space-suit operation, having access to the relatively few combat space-suits the Alliance had available. They were the Alliances specialists in boarding and either taking over or destroying enemy vessels. They were also the first line of defense if their ship was boarded. They were trained to identify any weapons in any part of a ship and use those weapons to take out boarders without causing undue damage to the ship. They were armed with blaster pistols, rifles, missile launchers, grenades, and sometimes vibroblades. They had a reputation for having a charge-ahead attitude."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Notable SpaceOps members"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "2nd Regiment - SpecForce Pathfinders"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "SpecForce Pathfinders made clandestine drops into enemy territory, establishing beachheads, performing reconnaissance and holding territory until reinforcements arrived. These sort of operations were typically conducted by a fairly small task force no larger than company size. These task forces were often in great danger since they could easily be annihilated if they were not relieved or extracted before the enemy could mount an effective counter-attack. The secondary role of the pathfinder specialization was to scout for other SpecForce units in ground operations . These missions were also conducted by small units although there was a least backup if something went wrong. Pathfinders were trained for survival, alien species recognition, and repulsorcraft operation. They were normally equipped with blaster rifles, grenades and survival equipment while they often fielded heavy weapons and repulsorcraft for superior mobility. Pathfinder troopers relied on surprise to overwhelm enemy forces."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Notable Pathfinders"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "3rd Regiment - SpecForce Urban Combat Specialists"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "SpecForce Urban Combat Specialists (or UCS, often simply called Urban Guerrillas) were trained for street combat and were skilled in finding ways to adapt the tough urban fighting environment to suit them.

They were more mobile than their urban counterparts, and often equipped with A280 and A295 blaster rifles. Since there were so many different terrain types companies specialized for specific combat conditions: arctic, aquatic, jungle/forest, mountain, desert and plains. White-uniformed rangers, trained to work in cold terrain, were present during the Battle of Hoth and stealthy forest-camouflaged rangers struck at the Battle of Endor. The wilderness regiment within a division tended to be spread a little thinner than others. Alliance bases were more than often located in deep wilderness on isolated worlds as far from the Imperial center as possible and therefore wilderness fighters were often assigned to these bases, when not engaged in active operations, to reinforce Sector Force troopers. Wilderness fighters were typically issued with blasters and survival packs. Since they were expected to be more mobile than UCS, wilderness fighters would often use repulsorcraft such as speeder bikes, skiffs and hovertanks. Wilderness regiments were the only SpecForce branch to maintain repulsortank units without the involvement of other trooper specializations. They were trained to use heavy weapons and artillery to reduce their reliance on Heavy Weapons Specialists."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Notable Wilderness Fighters"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "5th Regiment - SpecForce Infiltrators"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Rebel Infiltrators were among the most feared of the SpecForce divisions, specially chosen for their distinct hatred of the Empire. They operated as secret agents and spies, trained to slip through enemy lines and sow seeds of rebellion on Imperial worlds or sabotage important installations and ships. Equally comfortable on abduction and rescue missions, infiltrators were trained to use a variety of tactics and weapons. Most stuck to a basic weapon layout to stay light on their feet, but many infiltrators carried sniper rifles and thermal detonators as well.

They were trained in starship gunnery. Though well trained, their casualty rates were high. This is because once an artillery piece's location has been revealed in battle, the enemy tends to desperately try to disable or destroy it. SpecForce Heavy Weapons Specialists were trained to die rather than abandon their guns. Often they were armed with explosives, such as HX2 antipersonnel mines, standard thermal detonators and the HH-15 projectile launcher or missile tubes. When assigned to a taskforce, HWS personnel were commonly called either \"gunners\" if they specialized in heavy blaster weaponry or vehicle-mounted weapons, or \"vanguards\" if they specialized in shoulder-fired missile launchers in an anti-mechanized unit role."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Notable Heavy Weapons Specialists"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "7th Regiment - SpecForce Technicians"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Unlike other regiments, the 7th Regiment was a catch-all unit for miscellaneous specialists.
