It was already an aging model by the time of the Clone Wars. It was slow and unwieldy compared to starfighters. While not a military design, at least one such vessel, the Twilight, saw action in the Clone Wars, when Anakin Skywalker used it to escape Teth and was intercepted over Tatooine by Rogue-class starfighters. The G9 Rigger has 3 blaster cannons located on the struts projecting out of the ship. At least one ship of this class was used long after the Clone Wars, during the Evacuation of Dac over a century later in 137 ABY."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "LEGO made a set of a G9 Rigger Freighter called 7680 \"The Twilight\" released on July 26, 2008."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Non-canon appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
