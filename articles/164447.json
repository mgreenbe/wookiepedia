As it reached the surface, it reacted with the dry desert air to create a glass-like material, appearing to be frozen in time. Wintrium became harder as it aged, and given enough time it could become nearly indestructible. During the Starstalker's mission to retrieve wintrium from the Fountain, the Sith Sabers Anyul and Marjaak used their lightsabers to cut wintrium from the sculpture, although even with their lightsabers it was nearly impossible to cut. The fruit pak'pah could be grown only on Klatooine, and many scientists attributed this to the presence of wintrium in the planet's soil."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
