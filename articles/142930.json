A high-security interrogation center, the Crypt comprised two dozen compounds spread over a lifeless moon of the planet Pujool. In order to prevent mass breakouts, the compounds were all separated by several kilometers. Additionally, the different sections in the prison ran on different circuits\u2014which meant that, although it was impossible to open everything at once, it was still possible to open all the cells in a single compound in one go. The site was protected by an entire stormtrooper battalion on the ground, and by a whole fleet in orbit. By the time of the Empire's Iron Blockade of the Anoat sector, the Crypt held several hundreds of prisoners, including dissidents, traitors, and members of the Alliance to Restore the Republic."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several months into the Iron Blockade, key members of the anti-Imperial coalition known as the Uprising were taken to the Crypt after a failed kidnapping attempt on Commander Bragh of the Imperial Purge Troopers. Those important captives included Her Majesty, leader of the sector's Noble Court-in-exile, and Loathe, a prominent member of the Kouhun assassins. Consequently, a rescue mission was mounted by the Smuggler, a young scoundrel who acted as the Uprising's informal leader and Bragh met his end during the mission."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
