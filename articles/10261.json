The attack was ordered by Grand Moff Rycus Kilran, and was intended to be carried out by the crew of the Imperial transport Black Talon. The Talon's captain, Revinal Orzik, defied the Grand Moff's command and in response, Orzik was executed by a team of Sith agents dispatched by Kilran himself, eventually getting the crew to participate in the attack."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Upon engaging the Brentaal Star, the Black Talon was beset by laser cannon fire and Republic boarding parties. The Sith agents joined the ship's garrisoned Sith troopers and worked to repel the boarders. After repelling them, the agents took an Imperial assault shuttle and boarded the Brentaal Star searching for their objective, The General. Eventually they reached him, executed him and then returned back to the Imperial ship to withdraw before the Republic's reinforcements could arrive."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Prelude"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 3643 BBY, the Cold War, a proxy war between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic had stood for a decade. At one point a genius General had deserted the Sith Empire for the Republic and so Grand Moff Rycus Kilran assigned the ship Black Talon, to intercept the republic ship carrying the General and capture him. However the captain of the imperial starship, Revinal Orzik, saw it as a suicide mission and disobeyed his commands."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Kilran dispatched his specialized protocol droid, NR-02 to the Black Talon. NR-02 recruited a team of Sith agents, composed of an Intelligence agent, Darth Baras' apprentice, Lord Zash's apprentice and a bounty hunter to restore control in the Black Talon and to proceed with Kilran's orders to capture The General."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The team complied. They fought through Imperial troops attempting to enforce the captain's lockdown order to reach the bridge. There they encountered Captain Orzik, executed him and gave the command of the ship to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Sylas. Sylas immediately complied with Kilran's commands, sending the ship towards the corvette Brentaal Star to attack."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Battle"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When the Black Talon reached the Brentaal Star, the republic ship sent its pods full of war droids to sabotage the imperial ship while at the same time, attacking the imperials with laser cannon fire. The droids, led by the GXR-5 Sabotage Droid took control of the engine room. Kilran's team defeated the droids, destroying the GXR-5, and returned to the bridge. The Black Talon received a hologram transmission by the Grand Master of the Jedi Order, Satele Shan, who warned the Sith not to engage or otherwise she would arrive with her own fleet composed of 17 vessels to crush the imperials. The imperials ignored her and moved on, eventually boarding the republic ship in an Imperial assault shuttle."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aboard the Brentaal Star Kilran's team engaged a series of republic troopers and proceeded through decks. They fought and defeated Special Forces Commander Ghulil and his escorts and the GXR-7 Command Droid during this engagement, ultimately reaching the General as he attempted to evacuate. The Jedi Padawan Yadira Ban tried to protect the General but was slain."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The team confronted the General, who was seriously wounded as a result of the fighting.
