The principal moon shone a light purple, while the lesser had a greenish cast. Two hyperspace lanes also ran near Dantooine, the long, winding Veragi Trade Route, and the smaller Myto's Arrow\u2014a backwater route from Dantooine to Jaemus\u2014offered a faster trip. However, despite being in between both lanes, Dantooine was not easily accessible, but historians argued about why civilization on the planet never took hold and remained nearly deserted."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Most of Dantooine's terrain consisted of savannas, steppes, hills and rivers. It maintained a mild and dry climate throughout most of its 378-local day year, except for the rainy season in spring, which brought torrential downpours that turned the fertile soil into mud and tinge the brown grass with a shade of lavender."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Early history"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Several centuries before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, records mentioned involvement from the Jedi Order on Dantooine.

Among the areas of its biosphere zone was a recreation of Dantooine jungle, which was toured by Jedi Padawan Bell Zettifar while he attended a conclave there. The Great Hyperspace Disaster, an incident in which the freighter Legacy Run was destroyed in hyperspace, occurred soon afterwards. In the aftermath, Emergences of the starship's debris into realspace began occurring at random throughout the Outer Rim Territories, leading Supreme Chancellor Lina Soh to institute an extensive hyperspace blockade to prevent further disasters. The eighteenth Emergence occurred near Dantooine, prompting the blockade to be extended another fifty parsecs. Another one of the first twenty-one Emergences destroyed an orbital shipping facility near the planet which had been coordinating a large aid shipment to Outer Rim worlds affected by the blockade."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the time of the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems arrived on Dantooine and disturbed the planet's peace, with hopeful farmers following suit to grow crops and raise livestock on homesteads primarily powered by wind energy. Supposedly, the Confederacy came to the planet in search of valuable ancient artifacts, with the Republic responding by dispatching Jedi Master Mace Windu to deal with the situation. During the battle, many of Windu's troopers perished, but the Jedi was able to defeat the Confederacy's B2-series super battle droids and seismic tanks that caused dangerous shock waves to the planet's surface."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "While on Dantooine, the Republic troops were able to send out a distress signal which was later picked up by the Republic, who sent supplies and medical aid to the planet immediately aboard the Pelta-class frigate TB-73 with the help of Jedi Padawans Ahsoka Tano and Barriss Offee. However, the two Jedi were unable to complete their delivery mission as a result of an infestation of Geonosian brain worms aboard the frigate, and was later undertaken by Jedi Master Kit Fisto."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Age of the Empire"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire, Dantooine was an Alliance to Restore the Republic regional headquarters and operations sector. Dantooine was included in a map of the galaxy that listed safe worlds, starfighter hubs at level five or higher, regional headquarters and operations sectors, and deep space caches. The map was then incorporated in The Rebel Files."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 2 BBY, during the early rebellion, the former Imperial Senator and rebel leader Mon Mothma made arrangements for the rebel fleet to rendezvous above Dantooine. She wanted to unify the disparate rebel cells and factions and make official the Rebel Alliance. With the help of Phoenix Leader Hera Syndulla and the Spectres, Mothma managed to travel through the dangerous Archeon pass to Dantooine. Above Dantooine, Mothma gave an impassioned HoloNet speech urging the galaxy to rise up in rebellion against the Empire. Shortly later, the rebel fleet converged above Dantooine."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Galactic Civil War"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Shortly before the Galactic Civil War, the Rebellion used the planet as the location of their first base. By the time of the Battle of Scarif, that base had been abandoned, and the Rebels had established their headquarters on the jungle moon Yavin 4, a location that was already in use by Jan Dodonna's rebel cell."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Princess Leia Organa was held captive on the Death Star, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin threatened to destroy her home planet of Alderaan if she did not provide him with the location of the Rebellion's secret base. Organa then lied to him, disclosing the location of the then-current base as Dantooine. Tarkin, impatient to try out the Death Star's superlaser at full capacity,  deemed Dantooine \"too remote to make an effective demonstration\" and ordered the destruction of Alderaan anyway. Nonetheless, Imperial forces, led by General Cassio Tagge, reconnoitered Dantooine, only to find the remains of the abandoned Rebel base. Upon learning this, Tarkin ordered Organa's immediate execution. Thane Kyrell was one of those who were sent to explore Dantooine, and he was surprised by the level of organization and sophistication he saw in the abandoned base."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Rise of the First Order"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Following the outbreak of the war against the Resistance, the First Order, a remnant of the \"Old Empire,\" occupied and blockaded Dantooine.
