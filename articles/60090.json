Upon entering the Scipio system, Hawk and other pilots emerged from the three Venator-class Star Destroyers that had arrived to retake Scipio. General Skywalker, heading to Scipio aboard a gunship, contacted Hawk via comlink, telling the clone pilot that he would need air support once he reached the surface of the planet. Hawk reassured Skywalker, informing the General that he and his wing mates would be ready to fly in support of the General when he need it. Hawk and the other pilots proceeded to engage with the Separatist flotilla's vulture droids in their Clone Z-95 Headhunters. Breaking through the Separatist blockade, Hawk and his comrades were able to reach the atmosphere of the planet. Under orders from Count Dooku, the Separatist blockade proceeded to retreat from Scipio, abandoning the droid forces stationed outside the Main Vault of the InterGalactic Banking Clan on the planet surface."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Hawk first appeared in \"The Hidden Enemy,\" the sixteenth episode of the first season of the animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars.
