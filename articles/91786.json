The vessel was originally a standard G-1A transport, though the modified vessel made use of repulsorlift technology used in the construction of combat cloud cars. The Mist Hunter was piloted by Zuckuss and his droid partner 4-LOM, with room for eight passengers and a metric ton of cargo. It was armed with twin assault lasers and a tractor beam projector."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At some point, Zuckuss had installed a voice-activated computer into the ship. The computer, which was acquired from Mechis III, was unreliable at times. With this equipment, Zuckuss could request a search of his own ship or lay in a course to a specific location, without actually having to input the data himself."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Zuckuss commonly kept the ship filled with ammonia, so that he would not have to wear his breathing apparatus. There were three prisoner cells, located in the cargo bay, and each were airlocked so that oxygen-breathers could survive. Alternately, the cells could be filled with ammonia while the rest of the ship's interior supported an oxygen atmosphere. Zuckuss had made use of this feature in that manner when, due to ailing health, he confined himself in one of the prisoner cells while en route to the Rebel rendezvous point."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During the Battle of Hoth, the Mist Hunter exited hyperspace amid the skirmish and joined Death Squadron in pursuing the Rebel transports fleeing the besieged ice world. Zuckuss and 4-LOM disabled the transport Bright Hope, but, finding themselves at odds with the Empire, eventually helped the Rebels reach their secret rendezvous point. Toward the end of the Galactic Civil War, the Mist Hunter had become a familiar sight in both Imperial and Rebel fleets, until its pilots once more returned to their mercenary ways."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Inconsistencies"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "There is an inconsistency regarding the size of the Mist Hunter.\nIn the ships first appearance: *Of Possible Futures: The Tale of Zuckuss and 4-LOM it was stated to have multiple cabins and prisoner cells aboard and was able to carry not only its two man crew but also 108 survivors from the Bright Hope and two medical droids 2-1B and FX-7,."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If the standard G-1A starfighter is 15 meters long (bigger than an X-wing, but smaller than a Y-wing) it would not be possible to carry such a large number of beings. Therefore, either the ship Zuckuss and 4-LOM operated is so heavily modified that it has a capacity similar to a Sentinel-class landing craft (at 38 meters long, it is a ship more than twice the size and built specifically for troop transportation) or is a different ship altogether. As the events surrounding the rescue from the Bright Hope are the first canon appearance of the ship and integral to the characters and events, it must be assumed that all information stating the Mist Hunter is a fighter sized craft is in error."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}]}
