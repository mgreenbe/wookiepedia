The planetary administration was responsible for ensuring that the ship satisfied Imperial safety regulations, and also for levying appropriate fees and dues from it."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Some planets were known for offering cheap licenses and lax regulations\u2014and some SSPs were known to hold licenses from multiple home ports: by presenting a license from another port, the ship's captain could permanently avoid fulfilling his responsibilities."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Due to the basic limits on the designation, the SSP category included almost every small ship with a passenger license, whether it was a shuttle, freighter, or star cruiser. They were, however, divided between \"line-operated\" ships and \"independents.\" Lines typically provided regular inter-system services within a single sector; independents included every individual captain whose ship was licensed to carry passengers, with all the variation that implies\u2014though they rarely pursued a fixed schedule of routes."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
