For reproduction, the creatures could lay more than 300 eggs in a single birthing period. When hatched, the young k'lor'slug was immediately ravenous for food.\nIn addition to their aggressiveness, these creatures were considered pests aboard starships. They were known to invade the darkest spots on unsanitary space vehicles and breed. When dealing with more than 300 eggs hatching, an infestation aboard a space vehicle would become harder to control\u2014and more potentially fatal\u2014the longer it was tolerated."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "K'lor'slugs were known to the galaxy as early as the time of the Great Galactic War of the Old Republic.
