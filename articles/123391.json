Like the other sector armies, the overall command of the Eighteenth was shared between a highly experienced Jedi General and a Governor-General who was appointed by the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic. By 19 BBY, the last year of the Clone Wars, the Governor-Generals evolved into a permanent class of regional governors known as the Moffs."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Clone Wars progressed, Chancellor Palpatine promoted Lynch Hauser to the rank of Moff, giving him control of the Seventeenth Army and the Dustig Oversector.

Under the New Order of Emperor Palpatine, Hauser ascended to the rank of Grand Moff. Much of the Imperial Era was marked by the Empire's massive military buildup and resulted in a vast army far larger than its Republic predecessor. Thus, the total infantry force of the Seventeenth Army and all other sector units were increased to approximately 1,572,864 troopers, most of whom were of natural birth as clones became marginalized into a minority status."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
