Luke Skywalker is beside himself with grief and feels as if the Force has betrayed him, in allowing him to open fire on Shira's fighter. The Rebel Alliance personnel at the base look down upon Luke for his poor misjudgment. One of them, a belligerent soldier named Milo Fourstar accuses Luke of deliberately killing Shira because she rejected his amorous advances."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke goes down to the hangar bay where he finds Lando Calrissian standing outside the ramp of the Millennium Falcon. He tells Lando that he needs to use the Falcon to return to Shira's homeworld, Shalyvane. He needs to see if there are any clues left behind that could shed some light on this mystery. Lando is under orders to deny any such requests, but with a wink in his eye, he lets Luke know that the Falcon will be unguarded for fifteen minutes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Luke and Chewbacca take the Falcon and fly to Shalyvane. They land at the capital city of Chinshassa \u2013 Shira's alleged home town. Almost immediately, a band of Em'liy warriors descend upon them and begin attacking. They run away and hide inside of an underground warren. There, Luke finds an injured old Em'liy named G'hinji. G'hinji explains that Chinshassa has never boasted a Human settlement and that anything Shira may have told him to the contrary has to be a lie. Luke is no closer to solving the mystery of Shira's identity than he was before. Suddenly, he remembers a bloodletting ritual he witnessed Shira partaking in once at the Circle of Kavaan. He races down to the ruins of the circle in the hopes that repeating the procedure might yield some clue as to Shira's background. Borrowing a knife from Chewbacca, Luke slices open the palm of his left hand and lets the blood drip down onto the ruined cairns. Within seconds, there is a brilliant flash of light and Luke, Chewbacca and G'hinji are surprised to find Darth Vader standing before them."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This issue includes flashback appearances of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In the Swedish translation of the comic, Lando Calrissian compares Luke Skywalker's infamy after shooting down Shira Brie to that of Adolf Hitler."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Collections"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
