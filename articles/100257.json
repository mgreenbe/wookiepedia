As a representative of Rodia, Farr was devoted to his planet and his people and always had their priorities at the forefront of his policies. During the Clone Wars, a pan-galactic conflict between the Republic and its splinter state, the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Farr became a leading anti-war senator and promoter of causes to end the conflict. Farr suffered personal crises throughout the war, and his mistakes in trying to do what he thought was right would lead to his assassination."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Senator Farr served in the Galactic  Senate during several major events, including the Invasion of Naboo, the Separatist Crisis, and the Clone Wars. Early into the Clone Wars, Rodia became a target of piracy and as a result faced a supply shortage. Desperate for supplies the Republic was not offering, Farr accepted Confederate aid on the terms that Rodia leave the Republic and join them. Farr regretted his decision, however, and rejoined the Republic after helping his close friend, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, capture Separatist leader and Viceroy of the Trade Federation Nute Gunray. For the remainder of his life, Farr was a staunch loyalist to the Republic, though was noted for his involvement in attempts to end the conflict peacefully alongside other prominent and influential senators such as Bail Organa, Mon Mothma, and Amidala."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the war progressed, the Senate passed legislation increasing war funds and expanding the military. Although Farr and his colleagues had attempted to keep the acts from passing, their attempts failed, and Farr introduced counter-legislation that would keep either from coming into effect. Farr and Amidala worked hard to gather the support needed to pass his bill, though while he and his allies were celebrating their efforts, he died of what appeared to be heart failure. A subsequent investigation revealed that Farr had been murdered via poisoning by his aide, Lolo Purs, in retaliation for his brief decision to join the Confederacy. Following Farr's death, Amidala and Organa pushed to get Farr's bill passed, but the motion failed in the Senate.

Farr's relief efforts acquainted him with an educator, builder, and relief worker from Naboo named Ruwee Naberrie. Farr and Naberrie became good friends, and Farr served as Naberrie's strongest ally in the Senate. Being friends with Ruwee, Farr became close with his family and became an uncle figure to his youngest daughter, Padm\u00e9 Naberrie, when she was a young girl. Farr and Padm\u00e9 grew close, and she affectionately gave him the nickname \"Uncle Ono.\" Farr mentored Padm\u00e9 as she grew up, and she picked up several skills in politics that would serve her well in the future, such as downplaying her strengths to maintain the element of surprise. Padm\u00e9 became involved in Farr and Ruwee's relief work at a young age, and she joined them in 39 BBY as part of a relief mission to the planet Shadda-Bi-Boran. Shadda-Bi-Boran's sun was dying, causing ecological disaster and necessitating the relocation of it's populace. Although the relief effort managed to successfully evacuate the entire population, the refugees were unable to adapt to life because they could not replicate their homeworld's environment properly and died. Despite her father's misgivings, Padm\u00e9 eventually became the Queen of Naboo and became Padm\u00e9 Amidala.

Valorum's administration was hampered by heightened corruption, bureaucracy, and, above all, inaction. Despite Valorum's ineptitude, he was a well-meaning man and Farr was close with the Chancellor and supported him. Valorum's reign would come to a tumultuous end, however, when the Trade Federation blockaded Naboo in opposition to his taxation policies on Outer Rim trade routes, which the Trade Federation held a monopoly on. With negotiations failing and the people of Naboo suffering, Queen Amidala traveled to Coruscant to personally plead for the Senate to act. Farr was present during the special session called for Amidala's testimony, during which Senator Lott Dod of the Trade Federation disputed Amidala's claims and objected to a motion to solve the incident immediately without concrete evidence. Dod recommended that a commission be appointed to study the allegations made by Amidala, which was seconded by the representatives from Malastare. Valorum presented the idea to Amidala, who suddenly called for a Vote of No Confidence in the Chancellor's leadership. Amidala's motion led to Valorum's removal, and in the aftermath of the Battle of Naboo, Senator Sheev Palpatine won the election and became his successor. Farr wished that the fall of Valorum's administration had ended differently, but did not entirely oppose his removal and remained close with Padm\u00e9."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Advising Padm\u00e9"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In 28 BBY, Farr continued to serve in the Senate and was decidedly neutral in his politics and was unaffiliated with any specific faction. In that year, Padm\u00e9's term as Queen of Naboo ended, though she returned to a life of service when her successor and the people of Naboo asked that she become the new Senator of the planet after Senator Oshadam stepped down. Although he wished to be an ally with her, Farr maintained a distance from her during the early months of her career, reasoning that she would want to establish herself without having to rely on an old friend. The first they met after her senatorial career began was at a gala hosted by Senator Mon Mothma of Chandrila. Farr wore an iridescent blue suit to the event, which was held in one of the public gardens on Coruscant's upper levels. Not long into the night, Farr noticed Padm\u00e9 and approached her. Farr greeted her warmly and told her that it was good to be able to see her. Farr told her that he had hoped to meet her before, though he wanted to give her space. Padm\u00e9 thanked him and expressed that she too wished to have met him, though wanted to make sure she didn't look dependent on her father's connections. Farr commended her choice and asked if she had been doing alright. She informed him that she had settled into her new role well, and Farr told her that if she needed anything she could always call on him if she wished. At that moment someone on the upper tiers of the gardens called down to Farr, and he politely bade Amidala farewell and took his leave. Unbeknownst to Farr, however, was that the Amidala he spoke to was not Amidala at all; in an effort to gain a greater understanding of her colleagues, Padm\u00e9 had asked Sab\u00e9 to act as a decoy for her at the party. Sab\u00e9 dressed the part of Senator Amidala, while Padm\u00e9 disguised herself as a handmaiden. Despite this, Sab\u00e9 felt comfortable talking to Farr, though she was not used to his and Padm\u00e9's close physical spacing.

Following a debate the two had over the armament of Republic shipments in order to curb piracy, Padm\u00e9 came to Farr and asked for advice. Padm\u00e9 had been having a crisis of understanding her public and personal personas, and in a rare moment of vulnerability confessed her insecurities to Farr. Padm\u00e9 viewed Farr not as a colleague, but as a family friend, which made it easier for her to speak openly to him. Padm\u00e9 told him that she was struggling to understand her positions and felt as though she didn't know who to be in front of her colleagues. Farr told her that it was alright to be unsure, emphasizing that it was better to be aware of naivete than to ignore it. Farr reassured her that being honest about her opinions did not make her a poor senator and that she would find the balance between how she acted in private and how she acted in public in her own time."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "The Separatist Crisis"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ten years after the Invasion of Naboo, in 22 BBY, the former Jedi Master and current Count of Serenno Dooku became the public face of a secessionist movement on member worlds of the Republic, who had begun to withdraw in opposition to the corruption they believed to envelop the Senate. These secessionists formed the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and the Republic viewed this new government as a threat. In order to curtail the Confederacy's spread and protect the Republic in an event that the splinter state attacked, a new bill entitled the Military Creation Act was proposed in the Senate. The bill would allow Chancellor Palpatine to formally commission a Grand Army of the Republic in order to fight the Separatists. Farr continued to serve in the Senate and was present as Padm\u00e9, by now a prominent and accomplished senator, had become the leader of the opposition to the Military Creation Act. Amidala's opposition to the bill led her to be a target for assassination, and on the day the Senate was scheduled to vote on the bill a bomb exploded on her cruiser. Amidala managed to evade death by posing as a pilot, though a decoy and several guards were killed in the explosion aboard her ship. After a second attempt on her life failed, Amidala was removed from Coruscant for her own safety. In her place, Naboo's Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks was easily manipulated by supporters of the bill to propose that the Senate give Chancellor Palpatine emergency powers to raise the Grand Army of the Republic. Farr and his aides were present during the session in which Binks voiced his support for the bill, and when the motion passed, the Republic gained an army of clones of the Kaminoan government and entered into the Clone Wars with the Confederacy."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Clone Wars"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As the Clone Wars erupted into a pan-galactic conflict, Farr was present in the office of the Chancellor when Jabba Desilijic Tiure made contact with the Republic, pleading for aid in finding and rescuing his son, Rotta the Hutt.

Many of Rodia's supply ships were destroyed and ransacked, leaving Rodia with a major supply shortage that crippled the planet. The Republic did nothing to help Rodia during this time, and Farr became willing to accept help from other sources. Rodia's famine led Confederate leader, Viceroy Nute Gunray, to realize that this crisis marked a perfect opportunity to turn Rodia away from the Republic. Gunray reached out to Farr with the promise of sending immediate aid to the starving world, including food, ships, and protection from future pirate attacks. Farr, desperate to gain access to aid for his people, accepted Gunray's offer, including his one condition: capture Senator Amidala and turn her in to the Separatists. On the pretext of asking for Republic aid, Farr contacted Amidala and personally asked her to visit him on Rodia."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Senator Amidala, along with Naboo Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks and protocol droid C-3PO, traveled to Rodia to meet with Farr. Amidala met with Farr alone at his palace, guided by the latter's aide, Silood. Amidala greeted Farr in Rodian, and the two shared a warm welcome. Farr expressed his concern that she would not have shown up, but Amidala told Farr that both he and Rodia were important to her, as well as the Republic and that she would not have denied helping him. Farr questioned the Republic's care for Rodia in response, however, pointedly asking where the government was when Rodia's ships were destroyed and people starved. Padme tried to ease Farr by telling him that the Republic would vote to send supplies to Rodia. Farr took this moment to tell her that he had accepted help from Nute Gunray, and explained the benefits he was getting from the deal. Amidala furiously told him that Gunray would only bring the war to Rodia, just as he had to Naboo. Farr dejectedly told Amidala that he had already agreed to do all that he could for his people, and several B1-series battle droids entered the courtyard and surrounded the senator."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Farr activated a hologram of Gunray, who confronted Amidala and gloated in her capture.

Amidala replied that he always had a choice and tried to appeal to him, but Farr did not answer back. Gunray thanked Farr for his work and told him that he would arrive within the hour to deliver supplies. While a squad of battle droids attempted and failed to capture Binks and C-3PO, Farr led Amidala to prison atop a tower in his palace. As they approached the tower complex, Amidala again tried to appeal to Farr and told him that it was not too late for him to change his mind. Farr again solemnly ignored her pleas. As Amidala was brought inside her cell, Farr lightly protested the battle droid's use of chains. Farr was informed that it was a request from Gunray.

Silood told Farr that there were no signs of them. Farr was glad that there were no signs of them and assumed they had fled into the jungle. Shortly thereafter, Farr went to a hangar bay to meet Viceroy Gunray as he departed his ship. Farr and his welcoming convoy greeted Gunray and expressed gratitude for coming. Gunray, however, immediately demanded to see Senator Amidala. As Farr, Gunray, and their respective guards left the hangar and started towards the detention tower, Binks and C-3PO were spotted by a battle droid nearby. The droid mistook Binks, who was wearing a cloak, as a Jedi and the frightened Gunray ordered his droids to open fire. Binks managed to slip through a grate into the water below the palace. Gunray ordered that an alarm be sounded and that they find the Jedi. With C-3PO taken away and no sign of Binks, Farr and Gunray resumed their journey to Amidala's cell. Along the way, Farr inquired about when he could expect the supplies he was promised. Gunray informed Farr that his request for supplies would be taken into consideration after Amidala's execution. Farr was shocked by this revelation and tried to reason that because she was a prisoner of war, Amidala could not be executed.  He was unable to convince Gunray, and he and Silood stayed back a few meters behind Gunray, where Farr told his aide that Amidala was right and that he had made a terrible mistake.

Amidala and C-3PO were line up along a wall, and a trio of droidekas rolled out and formed an execution squad. Farr pleaded with Gunray to spare them, but his protests were silenced by the Viceroy. As the droidekas prepared to open fire, Farr noticed Binks in the distance and distracted Gunray by pointing him out. Gunray ordered his droids to fire at Binks, but a Kwazel Maw the Gungan had befriended underneath the palace rose up from the waters and attacked Gunray's forces. The Viceroy ran towards his ship, but the creature destroyed it before he could reach it. Binks and Amidala cornered Gunray, who ordered Farr to kill them. Farr instead aimed his blaster at Gunray. Farr revoked his decision to join the Separatists and confirmed to Amidala and to Gunray that he was loyal to the Republic, and placed Gunray under arrest. Gunray warned Farr that he would pay for what he had done. The Republic forces C-3PO had contacted arrived moments later and took Gunray into custody. With Gunray under arrest, Farr thanked Binks, who he believed was still a Jedi, for what he had done. Farr, Amidala, and her companions were contacted by Chancellor Palpatine, who told Farr that after the capture of Gunray and the testimony of Amidala, the Republic would send a convoy of supply ships to Rodia immediately.

Although Deechi and Burtoni had different opinions of Farr, with the latter showing respect for his colleague, they both saw Farr as an easy tool to use in their advertisements and propaganda and eagerly used his public statements against him.

Farr traveled to the Mandalorian capital city Sundari to meet with Kryze and her retinue as they prepared to board the ship.

Despite the efforts of Senator Free Taa, the two remained at odds and became confrontational. The tensions began to dissipate when Senator Merrik suggested they all prepare for dinner, which both the Duchess and Jedi agreed to. Later on, Farr joined the Duchess and his fellow senators for dinner. Shortly into their meal, however, they were alerted that there was a security issue. Skywalker and the clone forces had located an empty container in the cargo hold, from which several probe assassin droids had escaped. Skywalker contacted Kenobi and warned him that one droid had escaped the cargo hold and was heading up the lift towards the dining room, alarming Farr and the others. Obi-Wan ordered them to back away from the lift, and they went to the far side of the room, opposite the lift. The droid then broke open the doors, killing two of Duchess Kryze's Protectors and making its way across the dinner table. Kenobi managed to destroy it with his lightsaber, only for tens of smaller probes to eject from the larger droid.

Kenobi explained that the assassin probes had been brought on board the Coronet under the seal of the Senate and that he believed the droid would attack Duchess Kryze and anyone besides the senator who had brought the crate on board. Kryze objected to Obi-Wan's use of interrogation but assured her it was perfectly safe. Obi-Wan first noted the droid's violence against Senator Free Taa, before holding the dish up to Farr and clearing him of any blame. The droid next exerted hostility towards Senator Robb and especially Kryze, before falling still in the presence of Senator Merrik. Merrik flipped the tray out of Kenobi's hand, freeing the droid in the process. The droid scurried towards Kryze, but Kenobi managed to bat it away with a dish. The droid landed near Farr and attacked the Rodian. As Farr scrambled to get the droid off him, Merrik used the distraction to kidnap Kryze and leave the room.

After managing to gain access to the original testimony at great personal risk, Kryze convinced the Senate to rescind its vote and won continuing neutrality for her people.

Among those also invited were Senators Amidala, Robb, and Organa. At the informal meeting, the gathered senators agreed to oppose the bill and keep it from passing the Senate floor. While this meeting was taking place, a group of bounty hunters, led by Cad Bane, forced their way into the office building to take a group of senators hostage. Bane had been hired by the Hutt Clan to take Republic senators hostage in order to force the Republic into a prisoner exchange. Surrounding the senators, Bane informed them of the situation and advised them not to fight back. Philo, however, refused to listen to the bounty hunter and began his way to the door, only to be shot and killed by Bane. The seriousness of the crisis known, the other senators did as Bane asked. Bane contacted the Chancellor to demand the release of Ziro the Hutt in exchange for the kidnapped senators.

The hunters dragged Skywalker into the lobby with the other hostages, where Bane installed a series of bombs on the pillars in the room. The bombs emitted a detection laser that surrounded the senators, which, if triggered, would kill the hostages. Chancellor Palpatine had Ziro freed from prison, though he had Republic forces surround the Senate building to capture Bane. One step ahead, Bane told the Chancellor that if he was arrested, he would set off the bombs and kill the hostages. In the lobby, Farr and the other senators remained still, unsure of what to do. Skywalker woke up and asked what had happened. Farr informed him that Bane ordered them to stay put, which he recommended they do. Skywalker told Farr that it was not a good idea and took his lightsaber from Amidala. Striking the blade through the floor, Skywalker cut a hole around the senators, sending the floor they were standing on crashing down to the level below. Skywalker's maneuver saved the senators, as just when they fell through the floor, Bane set off the bombs during his escape. The senators fell to the ground, though none were seriously injured.

Led by Senator Organa, Farr was among this group, alongside Amidala and Senator Mothma. During the contested debate, Senator Gume Saam, a representative of the Techno Union, proposed a bill that would allow the Republic to open new credit lines with the InterGalactic Banking Clan. This deregulation would give the Republic the necessary funds to produce more clones, but at the cost of services not related to the war. While Organa and Mothma argued against Saam's bill on financial grounds, they were unable to deflect Senator Lott Dod and Senator Halle Burtoni's promotion of the bill. With the Senate in open bickering, Amidala entered the fray and argued that the deregulation would not only be fiscally irresponsible but also morally reprehensible. Amidala proposed that, instead of leading the Republic further in war, the Senate open communication with the Confederacy for negotiations to take place.

Back on Coruscant, Amidala presented the motion to the Republic with the support of Farr, Organa, and Mothma. As explained by Amidala and Organa, the fact that the Separatists were willing to reach out in peace was a sign that the deregulation of the banks was not needed and ill-timed.

Amidala attempted to persuade the Senate that the bombing attack had been meant to destroy the peace talks, though she was again called a traitor and found little support. Farr looked to Amidala, saddened by the verbal assault levied against her.

Farr apologized to Amidala for her loss, and Organa told her that they had to work harder to defeat Burtoni's bill in order to make sure she didn't die in vain. Organa told Amidala and Farr that in order to line up support against the bill he would need ammunition against it. Farr attempted to lighten the mood by jokingly reminding the two that they couldn't afford ammunition, but his joke fell flat. Organa asked Amidala to speak to the Banking Clan to find out how much interest they were planning on charging for the loan. Amidala asked Farr to join her, reasoning that he knew the Banking Clan representatives and snidely telling him that he owed her for telling a bad joke. Farr and Amidala went to the office of Banking Clan representative Mak Plain, where the Muun told the pair that the bank was going to charge the Republic at an interest rate of twenty-five percent. Farr and Amidala were outraged, and Farr pointedly told Plain that such a high charge was outright theft. Amidala was confused at the high charge, given that the Banking Clan's arrangement with the Republic was at a standard interest rate of ten percent. Plain asked both Farr and Amidala to calm themselves and explained that after deregulation, the same rules no longer applied. Plain also informed the two that the Separatists had no issue with the rate hike and had secured a loan to fund nearly three million credits to fund their armies. Farr muttered that the Separatists would wipe the Republic out with their increase in battle droids, and Amidala asked Plain why the Banking Clan would fund Dooku. Plain waved away their questions and stated that the Banking Clan had no stake in the war and that what happened on the battlefield was of no concern to them."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Farr and Amidala's inquiry into the Banking Clan proved helpful to Organa, who realized that the twenty-five percent interest rate would not only force the Republic to continue to operate in debt but also force the government to defund services unrelated to the war effort. Although he now had the ammunition he needed, a new problem arose as several senators had received threats warning them to vote in favor of the bill. Later that night, Farr was walking in the Monument Plaza when a mandatory blackout was put into order. As he walked down the center of the plaza, he was jumped by two thugs, Robonino and Chata Hyoki. Robonino grappled Farr to the ground while Hyoki kicked him in his side. Although he survived the attack, Farr ended up with a broken arm. The next day, while Amidala and Organa were attempting to sway more senators to their side, Farr walked up to them and revealed his arm, now being kept in a sling. Amidala told Farr that they had to do something about it, but all he said in reply was that the attack would not change his mind and that he would continue to support the defeat of the bill. Sometime later, he and Amidala paid a visit to Senator Christo at his apartment in an attempt to gain his vote. Farr parked his speeder just outside Christo's home, while Amidala was dropped off by her driver. Inside, Christo was unmoved by their attempt to reach him ideologically, believing that it was not worth being beaten up just for one vote. Farr told Christo that his arm would heal, but that the lives of those dying in the war would not. Christo again swatted this away, telling Farr that the clones were created for that purpose. Amidala tried to reason that the clones were people, but was told by Christo that the people he cared about were the ones who put him in office, angering Farr. Farr asked Christo when the last time he spoke to his constituents was, but the Quarren deflected the question and pointed it back at him. As it became clear that he wouldn't sway to either Amidala or Farr, Christo asked the pair what Organa believed about the issue. Amidala told him that Organa was preparing to speak before the full Senate, and Christo told her that he was willing to hear what he had to say."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Their attempt to gain Christo's vote having failed, Farr and Amidala departed the senator's home. Amidala was optimistic despite their failure, believing that once Christo and the other undecided senators heard what Organa would say in his speech, they would join their side. Farr offered to give Padm\u00e9 a ride, but she declined and instead told him that she would walk to her speeder, which her driver had parked a block away. Farr protested because of the attacks, but she told him that she could defend herself and he asked her to be careful. While Farr left in his speeder, Amidala walked down the street, where she was jumped and nearly killed by Robonino and Hyoki. After a lengthy chase on a stolen speeder bike, she managed to escape the pair but found herself held up by police while the bounty hunters escaped. The next day, Organa was targeted by the two thugs in a garage in the Senate building. Although the two were arrested by Organa's guards, Organa himself ended up seriously injured when his speeder crashed into a wall as he attempted to escape. Organa had his guards contact Farr, who found Amidala in the halls of the Senate and brought her into his office. A medic with Bail told Farr and Amidala that he was in no condition to give his speech. Farr ordered the medic to take Organa to take him to the hospital immediately, and before their call was ended, Organa asked Padm\u00e9 to speak in his place.

Amidala's aide, Teckla Minnau, arrived to dress her for her speech, and she gave Padm\u00e9 the necessary confidence by telling her that she could be able to sway more to their side because she listens to the people of the Republic, not just the elite in the Senate. In the Senate chamber, Mothma's stalling had just about failed as Vice Chair Amedda was preparing to begin the voting. Amidala arrived moments later and announced that she would be speaking on Organa's behalf. Once given the floor, Amidala gave a speech inspired by Minnau's personal struggles. Amidala's speech was a passionate defense of basic social amenities, during which she argued that the increase in war spending would come at the cost of the citizens of the Republic, many of whom on Coruscant watched her speech as it was broadcast on the HoloNet.

With aid from Organa and Mothma, Farr and Amidala began their efforts to gain enough votes to pass their bill. Farr himself was the leading promoter of the bill and was successful in convincing many senators to support it, though they were still in need of more to gain a majority. The day before Amidala was scheduled to speak before the Senate in support of the bill, Farr traveled to the docks for a clandestine meeting, where a mysterious figure tried to frighten him out of continuing the peace effort.

Farr calmly poured himself a glass of wine and said that when Padm\u00e9 addressed the Senate in her speech, she would be able to get the votes they needed by inspiring their colleagues to do what was right. Amidala told Farr that she hoped he was right. Purs addressed Farr in Rodian, saying that he was the most influential man on Rodia. Farr longingly looked to the ground and told Purs that even if he was an influential man, what mattered to him after all the mistakes he had made was to help bring about peace.

Suddenly, the group was interrupted by Burtoni, who had entered Amidala's office uninvited. Burtoni agreed with Padm\u00e9 that they shouldn't celebrate yet, angering the Naboo senator. Padm\u00e9 told Burtoni that they were having a private meeting, but Burtoni accused them of being Separatists conspiring together. Mothma's attempt to ease them both failed, and Farr addressed Burtoni directly. Farr told the Kaminoan that although her people had bartered the clone army in exchange for a seat in the Senate, she did not have free reign to go wherever or do whatever she pleased.

The discovery of the poison led the CSF to open an investigation under Lieutenant Divo. Following Farr's death, a small funeral ceremony was held on a floating landing platform in Coruscant's atmosphere. The funeral was attended by many of Farr's close friends and colleagues in the Senate, including Amidala, Organa, Mothma, Robb, Deechi, Riyo Chuchi, and Free Taa, as well as Chancellor Palpatine and Vice Chair Amedda. Others in attendance included Duchess Kryze and her Mandalorian Protectors, Farr's aides Silood and Purs, and leading members of the Jedi High Council.

Divo explained that Farr hadn't died of heart failure but rather had been poisoned. Amidala and Purs argued that Farr had no enemies, and even his political opponents respected him. Despite the senators' protests that no one could have hated Farr to the point of murder, Divo believed that one of Farr's secrets must had come out or a mistake had returned to haunt him, prompting someone to eliminate him. After the meeting, Organa, Mothma, Purs, and Amidala began walking towards the latter's office. Mothma questioned who could have wanted Farr to be hurt, but Purs told them that they were all being targeted. Organa told Purs that speculation was not helpful, instead telling the others that they had to work harder to pass Farr's bill. Amidala, however, suggested that they postpone the vote until they knew what had happened to Farr. Behind closed doors, Amidala told them that a delay would help them conduct their own investigation into Onaconda's death, despite Divo's ongoing case. At Mothma's urging, Amidala decided to allow Organa to help her. The two first went to Senator Deechi's office to question him and Burtoni. Deechi laughed at the idea of either of them killing Farr, and Burtoni coldly joked that, since Farr was often used in their fundraising campaigns, neither would kill their best source of income.
