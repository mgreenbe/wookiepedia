A standard model such as the Corellidyne CQ-3.9x holographic image disguiser was small enough to be worn on a belt, though its low memory capacity prohibited it from storing more than a single image, and its power supply was exhausted after only two minutes, unless it was attached to a larger source. Another model was the CQ-3.99 holographic image disguiser."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When in use, a holoshroud projected a mostly pre-rendered image over the target; the image had to be at least the same size as the target object or larger for obvious reasons. The high-quality image was incredibly realistic; capable of fooling the unaided eye, it even moved when the object or person did. However, some models had a tell-tale \"flicker\" to them; while too fast for the normal eye to perceive, it may allow some droids, cameras and other sensors to detect that something was amiss."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}]}
