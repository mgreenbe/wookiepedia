During his work, Dinn specialized in forging documents and selling counterfeit arts and artifacts. Apprehended by the Inquisitor Blaise Zirkonn, Dinn and Zirkonn connected with each other, forming a partnership to earn both wealth and influence. Sent back to Naboo by Zirkonn, Dinn was tasked with identifying Force-users by attempting to sell ancient Jedi artifacts to careless Forcefuls. Capturing at least a dozen Force-users, Dinn continued his operations with much success. She carried a blaster pistol for his own protection and wore refined cortosis gauntlets. To lure her potential Forceful victims into his trap, Dinn would offer to sell them the Tear of the Elders, a legendary artifact rumored to be connected to the rise of the Gungan civilization."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
