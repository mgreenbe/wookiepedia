They were a pair of columns of ice several kilometers tall, with flat plateaus on top. Within one of the two was the tomb of the Sith Lord Dramath the Second, who fled to Rekkiad when his half-brother Vitiate launched his campaign to conquer their homeworld of Medriaas. Later, a minion of Vitiate's came to Rekkiad with the help of Mandalore the Ultimate, and came to the Twin Spears, where he discovered Dramath's tomb, and plundered his crypt."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}]}
