During the Galactic Civil War, King Amand led an uprising on Molos against the Galactic Empire's garrison, and joined with the Rebel Alliance. In response, the Alliance dispatched Ral Garas and Sergeant Trask to advise the king, while bolstering his forces, creating an army. After debating what strategy to use when the Empire brought reinforcements to reconquer the world, King Amand devised a new strategy, and led his forces from the front during the Battle of Mololopis.
