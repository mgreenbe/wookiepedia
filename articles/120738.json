But it was not entirely lawless territory. On the tropical planet of Scarif, for example, the Galactic Empire established a research facility that would eventually host plans for the first Death Star, a weapon with which they intended to impose terror on all systems. Its formidable Citadel was an impregnable stronghold, and in its inner confines, and also on its lush beaches, a battle would be fought that would forever change the fate of the galaxy."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "External links"}, {"tag": "p", "text": ""}]}
