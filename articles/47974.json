Mostly covered by deserts, mountains and a single ocean, Fhost had its own beauty. The largest population center, Farpoint, was built on the remains of a spaceship that crashed there long before the Yuuzhan Vong War. Fhost was so far out from the main hyperlanes that all HoloNet shows that were available were at least four months old."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
