Alaris Prime was geographically hidden by the gas giant Alaris, and as a result had been untouched by the galactic community for close to one thousand years, when it had been the site of a battle in the New Sith Wars. Following their discovery, the Wookiees petitioned the Senate of the Galactic Republic to give them colonization rights to the moon. After two decades of political debate, Alaris Prime was awarded to the Wookiees, who colonized the moon sometime between 39 and 36 BBY. However, a company known as the Trade Federation illegally attempted to colonize the moon, forcing the colonists to fight back against the company. The Wookiees eventually managed to defeat the Trade Federation, and Alaris Prime later became a thriving technological hub for both the Wookiees and the Republic."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The rediscovery of Alaris Prime was first mentioned in the databank entry for Alaris Prime in the 2001 PC video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Appearances"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Sources"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Notes and references"}]}
