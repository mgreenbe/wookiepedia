The fighter, which was grayish-white in color with blue and yellow markings, had two wings that ended in laser cannons extending from two engines attached to the side of the rear of the fuselage, and a third engine sat atop the fuselage with two smaller weapon-tipped fins extending diagonally upwards. The pilot was situated in a cockpit at the front of the fuselage, and bombs could be attached to the bottom of the craft. Around 3643 BBY they were used in the Independent Operation Sebaddon."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind the scenes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The PT-7 starfighter was first mentioned in the novel The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance, and the novel The Old Republic: Deceived added the \"Raven\" designation.
