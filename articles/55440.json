When Revan asked him about the missing Selkath he attempted to charge him two hundred credits for some information. He also revealed to Revan information about Sunry's affair with Elassa Huros without charging (although he wanted to, he mistakenly uttered it). He said he wasn't interested in either the Sith or the Republic, and they weren't interested in him. When he heard about the attack on Dantooine he openly mocked the Jedi defeat to Revan, not being aware that Revan was a Jedi."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Personality and traits"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gonto Yas was somewhat of a rude person and a sore loser when it came to pazaak. When he lost a game, he blamed it on luck, believing that his skill was better then others, even if he was on a losing streak.
