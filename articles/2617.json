A large blaster cannon was mounted on the right side of the hub, while a claw appendage was located on the left. AZs were used as anti-personnel droids and over time, were known to develop a liking for cat-and-mouse tactics, which resulted in the droids being regarded as sadistic. Because this tendency reduced the droids' tactical sense, they were generally memory-wiped every two or three months."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "History"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "During a conflict on an unidentified forest world, a number of AZs were deployed and were tasked with hunting down patrols.
