Utani replies that he was equally \"unsurprised\" to find her setting off alarms and says there is a reason why the Triple-Zero matrix has been quarantined for centuries. Dr Aphra retorts that people with small minds want to hide beautiful things inside a museum and claims that it should be in an armory.
